00:00:51,151 --> 00:00:53,722
<i>South Hartford 911.
What is your emergency?</i>

2
00:01:27,921 --> 00:01:32,529
<i>This is Lieutenant Dreyfus, badge
number 3525, at 174 Willow Lane.</i>

3
00:01:34,527 --> 00:01:37,872
Now entering what appears to be
the living room.

4
00:01:38,698 --> 00:01:41,611
Living conditions are best described as

5
00:01:41,868 --> 00:01:44,280
being in a state of disarray.
Watch your step.

6
00:01:47,907 --> 00:01:50,410
Kitchen also in a state of disarray.

7
00:01:51,244 --> 00:01:54,248
Approaching the stairwell
where first victim was found.

8
00:01:54,481 --> 00:01:56,927
Note the instrument on the floor.

9
00:02:01,754 --> 00:02:05,429
Victim number one is facing north.

10
00:02:06,593 --> 00:02:09,938
Male, approximately 160 pounds.

11
00:02:10,563 --> 00:02:13,772
Sustained injury to the left temple.

12
00:02:16,903 --> 00:02:17,938
Now entering the basement

13
00:02:18,004 --> 00:02:20,814
where victims number two and three
were found.

14
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:30,524
Entered the basement of the house.

15
00:02:32,519 --> 00:02:34,863
We find victim number two.

16
00:02:35,121 --> 00:02:38,864
Female, approximately 120 pounds.

17
00:02:39,359 --> 00:02:40,702
Facing west.

18
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:44,806
In the victim's right hand,
we have religious paraphernalia,

19
00:02:45,198 --> 00:02:46,700
apparently is clutching.

20
00:02:49,469 --> 00:02:51,312
Heading south

21
00:02:52,472 --> 00:02:56,147
we find another instrument on the floor.

22
00:03:01,648 --> 00:03:04,322
We find victim number three.

23
00:03:04,651 --> 00:03:08,326
Male, approximately 210 pounds.

24
00:03:09,822 --> 00:03:12,496
We have trauma to the head.

25
00:03:13,326 --> 00:03:16,830
Apparent strangulation with rope,

26
00:03:17,163 --> 00:03:20,838
which is broken or torn away.

27
00:03:21,167 --> 00:03:24,842
We have blood splattering
against the door.

28
00:03:29,175 --> 00:03:32,748
In the center of the room,
we have a chair.

29
00:03:33,413 --> 00:03:36,519
The right armrest of the chair is broken

30
00:03:36,749 --> 00:03:40,356
with apparent claw marks
from a struggle.

31
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:44,695
Various straps used for restraint.

32
00:04:06,045 --> 00:04:08,286
<i>WJBP, Channel 11.</i>

33
00:04:08,448 --> 00:04:09,756
A quiet South Hartford community

34
00:04:09,816 --> 00:04:13,628
was leveled by tragedy as
three clergy members were found dead.

35
00:04:13,686 --> 00:04:16,292
At about 11:47 p.m.
on Sunday evening, the 20th,

36
00:04:16,356 --> 00:04:19,701
we received an emergency call
on our 911 line.

37
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:24,105
<i>At least three bodies were taken out of
this house, two local priests and a nun.</i>

38
00:04:24,163 --> 00:04:26,939
We checked the location for any
other victims and have not found any.

39
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:30,773
<i>Apparently, Maria Rossi was hosting
a church group meeting at her home.</i>

40
00:04:30,837 --> 00:04:33,511
Our homicide detectives
and our lab people

41
00:04:33,573 --> 00:04:34,677
<i>are conducting their investigation.</i>

42
00:04:34,741 --> 00:04:37,244
<i>Mrs. Rossi was found by police
in a crawl space.</i>

43
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:39,412
We can't speculate as to what

44
00:04:39,646 --> 00:04:41,148
<i>the cause or the motive may have been.</i>

45
00:04:41,247 --> 00:04:43,090
They are not ruling out any possibilities.

46
00:04:44,017 --> 00:04:46,429
<i>However, at this time,
we don't want to speculate</i>

47
00:04:46,486 --> 00:04:49,399
<i>on what may or may not have been
the cause.</i>

48
00:04:53,259 --> 00:04:55,933
<i>My name is Isabella Rossi</i>

49
00:04:56,596 --> 00:04:58,371
and that was my mother.

50
00:04:59,766 --> 00:05:02,372
<i>The thing you have to understand
about my mother</i>

51
00:05:02,702 --> 00:05:04,375
is that she just had a huge heart.

52
00:05:04,937 --> 00:05:08,942
<i>Down came the rain
and washed the spider out.</i>

53
00:05:09,275 --> 00:05:12,119
<i>Out came the sun
and dried up all the rain.</i>

54
00:05:13,046 --> 00:05:16,619
And there we are.
That was actually on my...

55
00:05:16,949 --> 00:05:18,292
Can you see that?

56
00:05:19,886 --> 00:05:21,957
That was my first birthday party.

57
00:05:22,288 --> 00:05:24,131
<i>And I don't think it was until I was</i>

58
00:05:24,457 --> 00:05:28,200
about six years old that
I actually started to notice, you know,

59
00:05:28,261 --> 00:05:30,673
<i>something was different,
her moods were changing.</i>

60
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:32,232
<i>Then, she went away for a little bit</i>

61
00:05:32,298 --> 00:05:34,278
<i>and when she came back
they said she was better.</i>

62
00:05:35,802 --> 00:05:37,179
But she wasn't.

63
00:05:37,637 --> 00:05:39,639
<i>We couldn't understand
what was happening.</i>

64
00:05:39,706 --> 00:05:41,151
<i>No one had answers.</i>

65
00:05:41,474 --> 00:05:43,647
So why are you doing this film?

66
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:46,813
Because I really need to

67
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:51,325
understand what happened.

68
00:05:57,156 --> 00:05:59,602
What Maria Rossi did,
and her subsequent life,

69
00:05:59,659 --> 00:06:02,640
was incredibly tragic and clouded.

70
00:06:03,096 --> 00:06:07,511
And caught in the middle of it
is a daughter who is just now learning

71
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:09,373
<i>the circumstances of that tragedy.</i>

72
00:06:09,669 --> 00:06:12,013
<i>Isabella, look at the camera, honey.</i>

73
00:06:12,672 --> 00:06:14,948
<i>If someone had asked me</i>

74
00:06:15,007 --> 00:06:19,717
how is it possible for Mrs. Rossi
to have done what she did,

75
00:06:19,779 --> 00:06:23,522
I would have gone through the list
of things that cause human aggression.

76
00:06:23,649 --> 00:06:27,028
Something like major depression,
or schizophrenia,

77
00:06:27,086 --> 00:06:29,430
<i>or dissociative identity disorder.</i>

78
00:06:29,489 --> 00:06:30,763
<i>It's my understanding</i>

79
00:06:30,823 --> 00:06:34,600
that her current psychiatric diagnosis
has been D.I.D.

80
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:39,040
But this is her seventh different
diagnosis since 1987.

81
00:06:39,098 --> 00:06:42,511
<i>You start wondering, is it in my genes?</i>

82
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:46,646
You know,
am I going to flip out one day?

83
00:06:47,206 --> 00:06:48,549
<i>Just a matter of time?</i>

84
00:06:50,543 --> 00:06:53,888
Two years after she brutally murdered
three people in her home,

85
00:06:53,946 --> 00:06:55,186
a South Hartford jury

86
00:06:55,248 --> 00:06:58,354
<i>found Maria Rossi not guilty
by reason of insanity.</i>

87
00:06:58,584 --> 00:07:01,497
Rossi was committed
to the South Hartford State Asylum.

88
00:07:01,554 --> 00:07:03,158
<i>And then in September of that year,</i>

89
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:04,424
<i>my mother was transferred</i>

90
00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:08,267
to the Centrino Mental Hospital
for the Criminally Insane in Rome, Italy.

91
00:07:08,327 --> 00:07:11,672
<i>I never really questioned why Italy.</i>

92
00:07:12,064 --> 00:07:14,908
When did your father tell you
what really happened?

93
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:22,416
May 23, 2009. I was 25 years old.

94
00:07:23,409 --> 00:07:25,685
He just said it. He said,

95
00:07:26,112 --> 00:07:30,185
"Mom attacked those people
during an exorcism."

96
00:07:31,083 --> 00:07:33,757
An exorcism performed on her.

97
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:35,957
It's the job of science to try to sort out

98
00:07:36,022 --> 00:07:38,502
what is a reasonable,
plausible explanation.

99
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:40,793
But science can't explain everything,

100
00:07:40,893 --> 00:07:42,031
such as a person

101
00:07:42,094 --> 00:07:44,802
levitating two feet off the ground
during an exorcism.

102
00:07:46,666 --> 00:07:50,011
I asked my dad if he thought
she was possessed.

103
00:07:50,703 --> 00:07:52,273
He said he didn't know.

104
00:07:52,605 --> 00:07:55,609
That she was gone. It didn't matter.

105
00:07:56,108 --> 00:07:57,451
Not any more.

106
00:08:00,379 --> 00:08:02,381
He died three days later.

107
00:08:06,652 --> 00:08:09,098
<i>I called the church
where the priests had come from.</i>

108
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:10,634
<i>And they wouldn't talk about it.</i>

109
00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:13,762
<i>They said they don't have
an ordained exorcist and never did.</i>

110
00:08:14,126 --> 00:08:18,131
So we're on our way to see
the Vatican School for Exorcism.

111
00:08:18,731 --> 00:08:20,472
And to see my mother.

112
00:08:21,801 --> 00:08:23,144
Are you nervous?

113
00:08:24,804 --> 00:08:28,149
Yeah, I'm nervous.
Twenty years is a long time, you know?

114
00:08:29,575 --> 00:08:32,488
<i>So, later, I was contacted
by the Diocese of Rome.</i>

115
00:08:32,545 --> 00:08:36,322
<i>They told me they never authorized
my mother's exorcism.</i>

116
00:08:36,649 --> 00:08:39,823
<i>That's when I knew I had to go to Italy.</i>

117
00:08:48,761 --> 00:08:52,641
I wonder how seriously they take
the exorcism school, you know.

118
00:08:55,101 --> 00:08:56,944
I hope it's not a joke.

119
00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:05,482
Oh, wow.

120
00:09:09,649 --> 00:09:12,493
There it is, St. Peter's Square.

121
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:19,133
Something like that.

122
00:09:25,665 --> 00:09:29,442
<i>This school has drawn a lot of interest
from all over the world.</i>

123
00:09:31,203 --> 00:09:34,150
<i>Maybe it can help me understand
my mother's situation a little better.</i>

124
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:38,852
From post-traumatic shock
to serious injury, death even.

125
00:09:39,178 --> 00:09:41,852
And not just for the victim.

126
00:09:42,748 --> 00:09:46,924
Also for the family members,
for anyone in the vicinity,

127
00:09:47,019 --> 00:09:49,021
especially the priest.

128
00:09:50,022 --> 00:09:52,366
<i>Sometimes a person</i>

129
00:09:52,758 --> 00:09:56,365
can be tormented
by more than one demon

130
00:09:56,429 --> 00:09:59,501
in what we call
multiple demonic possession.

131
00:10:00,032 --> 00:10:03,536
These cases are extremely
volatile and dangerous,

132
00:10:04,036 --> 00:10:07,540
and they sometimes
lead to transference,

133
00:10:08,207 --> 00:10:11,552
which means
the demon jumps from one person

134
00:10:11,777 --> 00:10:13,279
to another.

135
00:10:15,114 --> 00:10:17,754
The purpose of the class
is to educate priests

136
00:10:18,884 --> 00:10:20,420
and, of course, laypeople,

137
00:10:20,486 --> 00:10:23,763
about the Devil's presence in their lives,
in modern society.

138
00:10:24,156 --> 00:10:25,965
<i>For example, in Italy alone</i>

139
00:10:26,058 --> 00:10:28,971
<i>there are over 800 satanic cults.
We had a problem.</i>

140
00:10:29,028 --> 00:10:31,030
We needed more exorcists.

141
00:10:31,097 --> 00:10:33,600
<i>If it is possession,
then first and foremost</i>

142
00:10:33,666 --> 00:10:35,543
<i>we must rule out mental illness.</i>

143
00:10:35,601 --> 00:10:37,638
<i>Schizophrenia. Bipolar disorder.</i>

144
00:10:37,937 --> 00:10:41,180
<i>The course is designed
to explore all these conditions.</i>

145
00:11:18,811 --> 00:11:21,485
Okay, anyone, any thoughts on that?

146
00:11:21,981 --> 00:11:24,291
I believe the subject
was clearly possessed.

147
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:26,159
The subject
spoke in multiple languages.

148
00:11:26,419 --> 00:11:29,764
Come on. Speaking in tongues? Maybe.

149
00:11:30,589 --> 00:11:35,538
Incoherent babbling from
a mentally-disturbed person, certainly.

150
00:11:35,761 --> 00:11:36,933
I'm sorry, Father.

151
00:11:36,996 --> 00:11:38,942
And the subject displayed
abnormal strength

152
00:11:38,998 --> 00:11:42,002
when confronted with holy water,
and while heavily sedated.

153
00:11:42,068 --> 00:11:44,742
The delusional mind
of a paranoid schizophrenic

154
00:11:45,037 --> 00:11:48,211
may actually react to holy water
as if it were,

155
00:11:48,274 --> 00:11:50,880
I don't know, acid, urine.

156
00:11:50,943 --> 00:11:53,287
I'm sorry, I'm gonna have to disagree.

157
00:11:53,612 --> 00:11:56,286
The girl fractured her own femur.

158
00:11:56,615 --> 00:12:00,461
Her strength might have been abnormal,
but not impossible.

159
00:12:00,686 --> 00:12:03,030
It's very well known that

160
00:12:03,122 --> 00:12:07,798
some epileptics do break their bones
during a seizure. It's a fact.

161
00:12:08,294 --> 00:12:11,639
As I said, we must be sure to rule out
mental illness.

162
00:12:11,964 --> 00:12:16,310
In the end, this case
could not be proved as possession.

163
00:12:16,869 --> 00:12:19,349
<i>The diversity of the class
was comforting.</i>

164
00:12:19,405 --> 00:12:22,750
<i>It wasn't just priests or nuns,
but regular people,</i>

165
00:12:22,808 --> 00:12:25,482
<i>people who are facing
the same things I'm facing.</i>

166
00:12:25,811 --> 00:12:28,815
<i>People like me,
looking to help someone.</i>

167
00:12:29,682 --> 00:12:30,990
<i>So why are you here?</i>

168
00:12:32,651 --> 00:12:35,063
All this knowledge, you all agree on this,

169
00:12:35,121 --> 00:12:38,125
all this knowledge
is invaluable for us, no?

170
00:12:38,557 --> 00:12:41,333
David, what would you say
drew you to this school?

171
00:12:41,393 --> 00:12:43,566
In particular, to exorcism?

172
00:12:44,563 --> 00:12:48,739
The combination
of science and religion.

173
00:12:49,068 --> 00:12:51,639
I think,
based on my background in medicine,

174
00:12:51,704 --> 00:12:53,741
it gave me a greater sense of purpose.

175
00:12:53,806 --> 00:12:57,845
We all talk so definitively
about God and about the Devil

176
00:12:57,910 --> 00:13:03,861
but we can all agree that there's
no real facts, right? No proofs?

177
00:13:04,517 --> 00:13:07,760
God has never helped me.
What about you?

178
00:13:10,923 --> 00:13:12,425
Sure. Yeah.

179
00:13:12,858 --> 00:13:17,204
So when do you actually witness
an exorcism in class?

180
00:13:17,429 --> 00:13:19,431
This class is all theory.

181
00:13:19,765 --> 00:13:22,109
This is a school of exorcism, is it not?

182
00:13:22,434 --> 00:13:24,710
It's not reality.

183
00:13:25,938 --> 00:13:28,942
Look at the tape we watched today.

184
00:13:29,208 --> 00:13:34,055
That girl fit every criteria for possession
except she wasn't.

185
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:35,554
It's a mental disorder.

186
00:13:35,614 --> 00:13:38,595
No. When you witness
someone possessed,

187
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:40,153
you'll know the difference.

188
00:13:40,219 --> 00:13:42,324
You say that like you have.

189
00:13:42,388 --> 00:13:45,369
Have you witnessed a real exorcism,
Father?

190
00:13:46,892 --> 00:13:51,568
Yeah. Right after he saw
the Easter Bunny.

191
00:13:51,797 --> 00:13:54,505
I may have.
Can I ask you something, Isabella?

192
00:13:54,567 --> 00:13:56,046
- Sure.
- I'm curious.

193
00:13:57,102 --> 00:13:59,275
Why are you doing this documentary?

194
00:14:02,308 --> 00:14:04,811
I will be honest. My mom.

195
00:14:05,811 --> 00:14:09,315
When I was about eight years old

196
00:14:10,082 --> 00:14:12,255
she murdered three people.

197
00:14:12,651 --> 00:14:14,597
Members of her church.

198
00:14:15,654 --> 00:14:20,330
I found out that she had committed
these murders during an exorcism.

199
00:14:20,659 --> 00:14:23,663
An exorcism on her.

200
00:14:25,397 --> 00:14:26,842
- See you.
- It was nice meeting you.

201
00:14:28,133 --> 00:14:29,874
Your mother must be at Centrino, right?

202
00:14:30,135 --> 00:14:32,809
- Have you seen her yet?
- Tomorrow.

203
00:14:33,038 --> 00:14:37,282
Okay, well, the class
won't give you the answers you need.

204
00:14:37,343 --> 00:14:39,380
You need to see a real one.

205
00:14:40,479 --> 00:14:42,220
How do you know when it's real?

206
00:14:42,481 --> 00:14:43,653
You know.

207
00:14:44,049 --> 00:14:45,221
Good luck.

208
00:14:45,684 --> 00:14:47,027
Thanks.

209
00:14:52,558 --> 00:14:54,469
That was interesting.

210
00:15:00,633 --> 00:15:02,510
- Hey.
- What are you looking at?

211
00:15:02,935 --> 00:15:06,280
My mother's hospital instruction manual.

212
00:15:06,605 --> 00:15:08,516
Look at this thing, it's huge.

213
00:15:08,574 --> 00:15:09,848
Okay.

214
00:15:10,442 --> 00:15:13,787
So, camera one, two and three.

215
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:15,515
Which one do I look at?

216
00:15:15,581 --> 00:15:16,889
You don't have to
look directly at the camera.

217
00:15:17,116 --> 00:15:18,459
Right. I knew that.

218
00:15:18,717 --> 00:15:21,493
Remember, the cameras
are always running when the car's on.

219
00:15:21,553 --> 00:15:22,588
Let's go.

220
00:15:22,788 --> 00:15:26,964
You know,
my father received a letter from Rome.

221
00:15:27,393 --> 00:15:31,739
I guess because priests were involved.
The Holy Church got involved as well.

222
00:15:31,964 --> 00:15:34,672
And they said that they wanted to
treat my mother at Centrino.

223
00:15:34,733 --> 00:15:35,905
They called it

224
00:15:36,802 --> 00:15:38,440
an "offering of forgiveness."

225
00:15:38,504 --> 00:15:42,145
And I remember thinking that meant
God was forgiving my mother.

226
00:15:44,643 --> 00:15:46,247
I was young.

227
00:15:49,181 --> 00:15:50,182
Okay.

228
00:16:08,434 --> 00:16:11,108
- No camera.
- Show him the media pass.

229
00:16:38,697 --> 00:16:40,301
<i>It felt like a prison.</i>

230
00:16:40,366 --> 00:16:43,210
An old prison, really.

231
00:16:43,502 --> 00:16:47,917
But Dr. Costa seemed concerned,
so that was good.

232
00:16:49,208 --> 00:16:50,482
Follow me.

233
00:16:55,547 --> 00:16:59,188
I only show you this because your
mother has not had a violent outburst

234
00:16:59,251 --> 00:17:01,026
in over <i>7</i> years.

235
00:17:12,231 --> 00:17:15,838
She's extraordinarily anti-religious.

236
00:17:15,934 --> 00:17:19,609
We refrain from religious items
and discussion at all times.

237
00:17:20,005 --> 00:17:21,348
They can make her hostile.

238
00:17:21,573 --> 00:17:23,246
But I want to put...

239
00:17:21,573 --> 00:17:22,608
That's enough.

240
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:42,395
That's enough.

241
00:17:42,528 --> 00:17:43,939
I'm not sure if you knew this, doctor,

242
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:45,565
but my mother was involved
in an exorcism

243
00:17:45,631 --> 00:17:47,201
while she committed those murders.

244
00:17:47,266 --> 00:17:48,336
Did you know that?

245
00:17:48,767 --> 00:17:52,271
Isabella, your mother's case,
although unique,

246
00:17:52,604 --> 00:17:55,141
is not a matter of demonic possession.

247
00:17:55,207 --> 00:17:57,881
It's a matter of brain function.

248
00:17:57,943 --> 00:18:01,789
So why do you think she was transferred
all the way from the States to Rome?

249
00:18:02,281 --> 00:18:06,127
I don't know.
It was before I arrived here.

250
00:18:13,058 --> 00:18:16,130
Unfortunately, we've had to keep her
heavily medicated.

251
00:18:16,462 --> 00:18:20,308
An exhaustive amount of meds,
to be honest.

252
00:18:20,632 --> 00:18:22,475
Antipsychotics.

253
00:18:22,801 --> 00:18:25,475
Sedatives. Anti-anxiety.

254
00:18:25,804 --> 00:18:27,477
It constantly changes.

255
00:18:27,806 --> 00:18:30,810
She is a very, very complex patient.

256
00:18:51,930 --> 00:18:53,671
Miss Rossi, let's keep moving.

257
00:18:53,999 --> 00:18:58,004
She is having a very good day today.
But there still are rules.

258
00:18:58,337 --> 00:19:02,285
Don't talk about faith or God.
And stay passive.

259
00:19:02,608 --> 00:19:07,284
Hostility and aggression are...
Well, they've provoked her in the past.

260
00:19:11,783 --> 00:19:14,457
Just precautions. It will be fine.

261
00:19:14,686 --> 00:19:18,532
In fact, there is a very good chance
she won't even recognize you.

262
00:19:20,792 --> 00:19:22,135
Maria?

263
00:19:24,796 --> 00:19:26,469
You have a visitor.

264
00:19:37,376 --> 00:19:38,719
Come. Come.

265
00:20:10,909 --> 00:20:12,252
Hi, Mom.

266
00:20:17,683 --> 00:20:19,856
I like your drawings.

267
00:20:24,022 --> 00:20:28,596
Maria, I'd like to speak with you
if you'd let me, please.

268
00:20:30,929 --> 00:20:32,931
My name is Isabella.

269
00:20:33,599 --> 00:20:35,442
Isabella Rossi.

270
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:42,712
I'm your daughter.

271
00:20:51,283 --> 00:20:54,127
I just haven't seen you in a long time.

272
00:20:56,555 --> 00:20:58,125
Connect the cuts.

273
00:20:59,291 --> 00:21:03,296
Connect the cuts. Connect the cuts.
Connect the cuts.

274
00:21:03,629 --> 00:21:05,302
Connect the cuts. Connect the cuts.

275
00:21:05,631 --> 00:21:08,305
Connect the cuts. Connect the cuts.

276
00:21:10,135 --> 00:21:11,580
Connect the cuts. Connect the cuts.

277
00:21:16,642 --> 00:21:19,816
Connect the cuts. Connect the cuts.

278
00:21:24,650 --> 00:21:26,652
Do you recognize this?

279
00:21:29,087 --> 00:21:31,499
Do you know how to connect the cuts?

280
00:21:33,325 --> 00:21:35,430
I don't know what that means.

281
00:21:38,330 --> 00:21:40,833
Connect the cuts.

282
00:21:42,834 --> 00:21:44,836
Did you do that to yourself?

283
00:21:49,007 --> 00:21:50,145
Please stop.

284
00:21:53,111 --> 00:21:57,116
Maria, I came a very long way
to see you.

285
00:21:58,150 --> 00:22:01,063
Do you want to see my painting?

286
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:04,530
Yes. I'd like that. I'd love that.

287
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:19,576
Yes, yes. Maria, he was your husband.
You loved him very much.

288
00:22:21,506 --> 00:22:23,008
Do you remember?

289
00:22:25,077 --> 00:22:26,579
Who are you?

290
00:22:26,845 --> 00:22:30,315
I'm Isabella. I'm your daughter.

291
00:22:30,382 --> 00:22:33,454
- I don't have a daughter.
- Yes, yes, you do.

292
00:22:33,518 --> 00:22:35,657
We just haven't seen each other
in a very long time.

293
00:22:35,721 --> 00:22:38,224
I don't have a daughter.

294
00:22:40,726 --> 00:22:42,069
Do I?

295
00:22:45,897 --> 00:22:48,070
Why? Why?

296
00:22:49,334 --> 00:22:50,904
Why not?

297
00:22:53,238 --> 00:22:57,584
Well, thank you for coming.
Please say hello to your family from me.

298
00:22:57,909 --> 00:23:01,880
Have a nice day. Thank you for coming.
I have to go. I have to go.

299
00:23:02,414 --> 00:23:04,690
I have to get ready. I have to get ready.

300
00:23:05,584 --> 00:23:08,360
I have to get ready. Get ready.

301
00:23:08,587 --> 00:23:11,431
Get ready.

302
00:23:16,695 --> 00:23:19,369
You shouldn't have killed.

303
00:23:19,765 --> 00:23:21,210
What did you say?

304
00:23:22,434 --> 00:23:26,439
Maria, please. I don't have a lot of time.
Please, tell me something.

305
00:23:30,142 --> 00:23:33,146
You shouldn't have killed your child.

306
00:23:42,654 --> 00:23:44,224
What?

307
00:24:01,573 --> 00:24:04,986
It's against God's will, you know.

308
00:24:17,756 --> 00:24:19,758
Out, out, out!

309
00:24:21,827 --> 00:24:24,671
Shit, that was great.
That was great stuff.

310
00:24:26,598 --> 00:24:28,168
Are you all right?

311
00:24:30,836 --> 00:24:32,179
Isabella?

312
00:24:32,971 --> 00:24:34,138
Isabella, I...

313
00:25:00,699 --> 00:25:03,475
<i>What's it like, losing both parents?</i>

314
00:25:05,704 --> 00:25:08,708
<i>It feels empty.</i>

315
00:25:10,742 --> 00:25:13,416
<i>Like there's no safety net
to fall back on.</i>

316
00:25:13,879 --> 00:25:16,052
<i>And it forces you to be resilient.</i>

317
00:25:16,214 --> 00:25:19,627
<i>Possession and exorcism
have dictated my life.</i>

318
00:25:20,051 --> 00:25:23,225
<i>It took my mom
and it basically killed my dad.</i>

319
00:25:23,555 --> 00:25:25,330
<i>It defines me now.</i>

320
00:25:25,891 --> 00:25:28,235
<i>I mean, here I am.</i>

321
00:25:28,293 --> 00:25:31,831
<i>I flew halfway across...
You know, halfway across the world.</i>

322
00:25:31,897 --> 00:25:34,503
<i>To see this woman
who I never thought I'd see again.</i>

323
00:25:35,233 --> 00:25:37,076
<i>I don't like that it defines me.</i>

324
00:25:38,203 --> 00:25:41,776
<i>I contacted Father Ben Rawlings
and David Keane</i>

325
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:45,117
<i>in hopes that they would review
the footage of my mother.</i>

326
00:25:46,378 --> 00:25:48,790
Luckily, they agreed
and invited me to their loft.

327
00:26:02,394 --> 00:26:03,737
Isabella, hi, welcome.

328
00:26:03,962 --> 00:26:06,067
- How are you?
- Good. Come in.

329
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:12,174
It's hard to say
why I wanted to be a priest.

330
00:26:13,471 --> 00:26:15,747
<i>Maybe I was drawn to helping people.</i>

331
00:26:16,408 --> 00:26:21,721
<i>I think that duality exists within all of
us and, occasionally, it can take form.</i>

332
00:26:22,314 --> 00:26:26,820
<i>Science can no longer help,
and religion has to take over.</i>

333
00:26:27,319 --> 00:26:29,959
Which can be really difficult
for people to accept.

334
00:26:30,121 --> 00:26:33,227
Isabella, nice to see you again.
How are you? You okay? Okay, great.

335
00:26:33,458 --> 00:26:36,064
- Can I get you a cup of tea or anything?
- Sure.

336
00:26:36,127 --> 00:26:38,471
I'm sorry, I forgot your...

337
00:26:38,797 --> 00:26:40,174
- Michael.
- Michael.

338
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:44,779
My family were always very religious.

339
00:26:44,836 --> 00:26:46,816
My mother and father,
they were teachers,

340
00:26:46,905 --> 00:26:50,352
but I was closest to my uncle.
He was a priest.

341
00:26:51,743 --> 00:26:55,748
<i>By the time I was 13,
he told me that he was an exorcist.</i>

342
00:26:55,981 --> 00:26:57,654
<i>And, well,</i>

343
00:26:59,317 --> 00:27:00,990
if you can imagine...

344
00:27:01,987 --> 00:27:05,662
It's like, I suppose, you know,
you being told that

345
00:27:06,324 --> 00:27:08,167
your dad is Superman.

346
00:27:08,493 --> 00:27:11,667
That's what it felt like to me.
That he was in direct,

347
00:27:12,664 --> 00:27:15,611
you know, war, I suppose,
with the Devil.

348
00:27:18,336 --> 00:27:20,748
And, I don't know,
it blew me away, really.

349
00:27:21,606 --> 00:27:26,248
<i>And so, he took me along with him
and by the time I was 18,</i>

350
00:27:26,311 --> 00:27:29,349
I'd seen four exorcisms.
I'd even assisted on one.

351
00:27:29,648 --> 00:27:31,821
And it just changes you.

352
00:27:33,184 --> 00:27:35,994
<i>Unfortunately, he passed away
a couple years ago.</i>

353
00:27:36,221 --> 00:27:39,998
Anyway, when I was 23,
I went into the priesthood.

354
00:27:40,659 --> 00:27:43,731
And by the time I was 27,
I was an ordained exorcist.

355
00:27:47,232 --> 00:27:49,678
<i>But I'll tell you this.</i>

356
00:27:50,235 --> 00:27:52,909
After all the years
that I've been in the Church

357
00:27:53,171 --> 00:27:55,845
I've seen the Devil
way more than I've seen God.

358
00:27:56,174 --> 00:27:58,484
That's just not the way
it's supposed to be.

359
00:28:01,146 --> 00:28:03,524
There, what did she say to you there?

360
00:28:05,050 --> 00:28:07,792
Yeah, at the end there,
she started remembering things,

361
00:28:07,852 --> 00:28:10,696
specific things,
and she said something to me.

362
00:28:10,922 --> 00:28:12,924
But I'm not sure if she said...

363
00:28:13,191 --> 00:28:14,693
What? What was it?

364
00:28:17,195 --> 00:28:19,869
I terminated a pregnancy
about four years ago.

365
00:28:20,098 --> 00:28:22,442
The doctor said
I couldn't carry it to term, so...

366
00:28:22,701 --> 00:28:25,705
Anyway, she knew about it,
and she said that...

367
00:28:26,037 --> 00:28:31,043
Something about
being against God's will or something.

368
00:28:31,376 --> 00:28:33,287
Hang on. Let's just look at that.

369
00:28:33,712 --> 00:28:36,556
It's against God's will, you know.

370
00:28:36,781 --> 00:28:37,851
That means something, right?

371
00:28:37,916 --> 00:28:41,363
Possibly. You said you had a copy
of her medical charts?

372
00:28:41,586 --> 00:28:42,894
What are those?

373
00:28:44,689 --> 00:28:46,066
She cuts herself.

374
00:28:46,124 --> 00:28:48,468
Those are crosses, Ben.

375
00:28:49,561 --> 00:28:52,405
Crosses? Wait, wouldn't she
not want crosses if she's possessed?

376
00:28:52,497 --> 00:28:54,272
- Not necessarily.
- Look at them. Look at them.

377
00:28:54,332 --> 00:28:56,812
The way that she's seeing them,
they're upside down.

378
00:28:56,901 --> 00:29:01,077
They're inverted crosses.
They're typically used in Satanic rituals.

379
00:29:01,573 --> 00:29:04,417
- I don't have a daughter.
- Wait, is she speaking with an accent?

380
00:29:04,476 --> 00:29:06,251
Yeah, she did that some. Why?

381
00:29:06,311 --> 00:29:08,313
Different accents
can be like speaking in tongues.

382
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:11,552
The pregnancy,
did you tell her about that at all?

383
00:29:11,616 --> 00:29:12,651
No.

384
00:29:12,751 --> 00:29:13,752
And you're absolutely sure

385
00:29:13,818 --> 00:29:16,025
there's no other way
she could have found out?

386
00:29:16,087 --> 00:29:18,158
I mean, there's no way.

387
00:29:18,490 --> 00:29:22,063
See, there are basically four factors

388
00:29:22,127 --> 00:29:25,939
when it comes to
determining demonic possession.

389
00:29:25,997 --> 00:29:28,170
One, unnatural strength.

390
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:31,174
You got aversion to holy objects.

391
00:29:31,503 --> 00:29:34,245
Languages or events
that they could not have known.

392
00:29:34,305 --> 00:29:36,182
And preternatural movement,

393
00:29:36,441 --> 00:29:40,981
which is basically
objects moving around the room.

394
00:29:42,413 --> 00:29:46,225
So, strength? No. Languages, no.

395
00:29:46,284 --> 00:29:48,958
Preternatural movement, no.
Aversion to holy objects, maybe.

396
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:51,728
Yeah, but there are accents
and, Ben, she knew that information.

397
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:53,633
Yeah, that interests me.

398
00:29:58,463 --> 00:30:00,704
We need to show you something.

399
00:30:02,333 --> 00:30:04,711
Okay. Can I bring the camera?

400
00:30:08,473 --> 00:30:10,350
- Sure.
- All right.

401
00:30:10,542 --> 00:30:11,543
Okay.

402
00:30:12,210 --> 00:30:15,054
- Can I bring this?
- Yeah, of course. Come on through.

403
00:30:16,714 --> 00:30:18,990
I'm good. I'm right behind you.
Keep going.

404
00:30:24,222 --> 00:30:27,226
What is all this? Who are these people?

405
00:30:27,559 --> 00:30:30,506
These are people
the Church turned down for exorcism.

406
00:30:30,728 --> 00:30:35,074
- And they're all possessed?
- We believe they are.

407
00:30:35,333 --> 00:30:38,246
These two cases are resolved.
Those two are open

408
00:30:38,503 --> 00:30:40,744
and we're almost done with this one.

409
00:30:41,005 --> 00:30:44,680
This is the girl, Rosa, right?
From the video we saw in Gallo's class?

410
00:30:44,742 --> 00:30:46,415
You both thought she was possessed.

411
00:30:46,477 --> 00:30:49,424
She is.
We think the Church made a mistake.

412
00:30:52,483 --> 00:30:54,485
So correct me if I'm wrong,

413
00:30:55,420 --> 00:30:59,766
but you guys are performing
these exorcisms yourselves,

414
00:31:00,091 --> 00:31:02,196
without the Church's permission?

415
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:06,765
That's right. We have to. Otherwise,
these people would continue to suffer.

416
00:31:09,234 --> 00:31:10,577
What is all that?

417
00:31:09,234 --> 00:31:11,680
We monitor everything.
Heart rate, blood pressure.

418
00:31:10,735 --> 00:31:13,181
We monitor everything.
Heart rate, blood pressure.

419
00:31:13,238 --> 00:31:14,444
Yeah, go ahead.

420
00:31:14,505 --> 00:31:17,349
That's a camera we use
to determine pupil dilation,

421
00:31:17,408 --> 00:31:20,082
which is very important
in cases of possession.

422
00:31:20,345 --> 00:31:23,417
Nine millimeters
is as large as the average pupil gets.

423
00:31:23,681 --> 00:31:25,627
Maybe 10 or 11
under certain substances

424
00:31:25,683 --> 00:31:28,027
like cocaine, psilocybin,
methamphetamines.

425
00:31:28,253 --> 00:31:30,699
Anything above 11
is considered preternatural.

426
00:31:30,922 --> 00:31:32,697
Why doesn't the Church
help these people?

427
00:31:32,757 --> 00:31:34,100
You see, that's just it.

428
00:31:34,158 --> 00:31:36,934
The Church isn't in the business
of healing people.

429
00:31:37,195 --> 00:31:38,538
The bureaucracy won't allow it.

430
00:31:38,763 --> 00:31:41,937
Their hands are tied. In 1999,
the Church changed the exorcism rites

431
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,378
for the first time in almost 400 years.

432
00:31:44,435 --> 00:31:46,346
Now a priest has to be
absolutely certain

433
00:31:46,404 --> 00:31:49,647
that there's an evil presence
in order to even attempt an exorcism.

434
00:31:49,707 --> 00:31:52,381
And that's a near impossible task,
because a lot of the time

435
00:31:52,610 --> 00:31:55,989
it takes an exorcism
for a demon to reveal itself.

436
00:31:56,047 --> 00:31:58,823
But rather than get distracted
by the Church's hypocrisy,

437
00:31:58,950 --> 00:32:00,896
we're going to
continue to care for these people.

438
00:32:00,985 --> 00:32:02,987
So that means that my mother's case
can actually be something...

439
00:32:03,054 --> 00:32:04,362
No, no. Isabella, you...

440
00:32:04,722 --> 00:32:06,998
The Church will never pursue
your mother's case

441
00:32:07,091 --> 00:32:08,832
because the last time someone did,
people died.

442
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:10,830
What do you suggest?

443
00:32:11,095 --> 00:32:12,699
If you really want to help your mother,

444
00:32:12,764 --> 00:32:15,005
you need a better understanding
of exorcism.

445
00:32:15,266 --> 00:32:17,212
A real understanding.

446
00:32:18,102 --> 00:32:22,380
Okay. So take more classes
and maybe show Gallo the tape?

447
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:27,617
Isabella, you'll learn more
in five minutes of an exorcism

448
00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:30,626
than you will
in three months in some class.

449
00:32:30,782 --> 00:32:32,227
Plus, you'll get to know
the real difference

450
00:32:32,283 --> 00:32:34,923
between possession and mental illness.

451
00:32:39,290 --> 00:32:42,134
So witness a real exorcism?

452
00:32:43,962 --> 00:32:45,202
With you?

453
00:32:45,797 --> 00:32:47,140
If you want.

454
00:32:54,372 --> 00:32:58,286
So the exorcism rites,
when they were updated,

455
00:32:58,343 --> 00:33:00,118
what exactly changed?

456
00:33:00,378 --> 00:33:03,723
Well, for one, all media coverage
of exorcisms were banned.

457
00:33:03,982 --> 00:33:06,155
Not that they were filmed much anyway.

458
00:33:06,384 --> 00:33:09,160
Exorcisms can take minutes
or they can take years.

459
00:33:09,220 --> 00:33:10,563
No two are the same.

460
00:33:13,057 --> 00:33:15,401
Is this thing we're doing even legal?

461
00:33:16,227 --> 00:33:18,173
No. Not exactly.

462
00:33:21,733 --> 00:33:23,974
You never know what's going to happen.

463
00:33:39,917 --> 00:33:42,261
So do you still get nervous or...

464
00:33:45,590 --> 00:33:47,194
No, not really.

465
00:33:48,393 --> 00:33:49,872
Demons, like angels, have orders,

466
00:33:49,927 --> 00:33:51,998
or spheres, to be more specific.
A hierarchy, basically.

467
00:33:52,764 --> 00:33:56,041
<i>Now, it's imperative you get the demon
to reveal itself so you can deduce</i>

468
00:33:56,100 --> 00:33:57,670
its rank in that hierarchy.

469
00:33:58,603 --> 00:33:59,946
<i>In our last session</i>

470
00:34:00,204 --> 00:34:01,945
we were able to hone in
on our demon's identity.

471
00:34:02,006 --> 00:34:03,076
His name is Berith.

472
00:34:03,775 --> 00:34:05,982
Look, I know we went over this before.

473
00:34:06,044 --> 00:34:08,115
Keep us between you and her, okay.
I'm not kidding.

474
00:34:08,179 --> 00:34:09,487
All right, all right.

475
00:34:20,958 --> 00:34:23,199
- Father.
- How is she?

476
00:34:27,065 --> 00:34:30,410
- She's worse? Okay, let me see.
- No, no.

477
00:34:31,302 --> 00:34:35,808
We had to move her downstairs.
To the basement.

478
00:34:36,407 --> 00:34:37,750
The basement?

479
00:34:41,112 --> 00:34:42,455
This is it.

480
00:34:43,214 --> 00:34:47,026
We're actually going to see a person
who is supposedly possessed.

481
00:34:47,552 --> 00:34:50,590
So I guess now we'll see
if it's bullshit or not.

482
00:34:59,564 --> 00:35:00,907
She's in here.

483
00:35:02,066 --> 00:35:03,409
Michael, come in.

484
00:35:02,066 --> 00:35:03,909
Everyone, bow their heads.

485
00:35:04,569 --> 00:35:06,412
Everyone, bow their heads.

486
00:35:08,573 --> 00:35:12,578
May the Lord bless us and keep us.
May the Lord let His face shine upon us.

487
00:35:12,777 --> 00:35:15,553
May the Lord lift up His countenance
onto us and give us peace.

488
00:35:15,913 --> 00:35:17,859
- Amen.
- Amen.

489
00:35:57,855 --> 00:36:00,199
This really is no place for her,
Mrs. Sorlini.

490
00:36:00,458 --> 00:36:03,302
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
We don't know what to do.

491
00:36:03,361 --> 00:36:06,171
Please, please, it's going to be okay.
It's going to be okay.

492
00:36:07,298 --> 00:36:08,470
Rosa?

493
00:36:25,483 --> 00:36:30,489
Bless you for your prayers.
You must leave her to us now. All right?

494
00:36:30,721 --> 00:36:31,722
Yes, Father.

495
00:36:31,989 --> 00:36:34,993
This is to help loosen her limbs,
keep her calm.

496
00:36:35,059 --> 00:36:37,903
It's very similar to a muscle relaxant.

497
00:36:43,067 --> 00:36:44,569
She's looking right at me.

498
00:37:19,870 --> 00:37:20,871
Okay.

499
00:37:22,940 --> 00:37:23,941
Okay.

500
00:37:24,609 --> 00:37:26,213
Let's get set up.

501
00:37:51,569 --> 00:37:54,140
It's best just to stay close
to Michael, okay?

502
00:37:55,573 --> 00:37:58,417
- A little to the right.
- No, no. It's set.

503
00:38:06,984 --> 00:38:09,157
It is Thursday, December 3, 2009.

504
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:11,422
Subject, Rosa Sorlini.

505
00:38:11,656 --> 00:38:14,830
Last session, November 13, 2009.

506
00:38:15,159 --> 00:38:18,834
Rosa's appearance has worsened,
skin color and weight.

507
00:38:19,263 --> 00:38:21,504
Temperament appears stable.

508
00:38:21,832 --> 00:38:25,837
Vitals are slightly elevated,
but basically normal.

509
00:38:26,671 --> 00:38:30,847
Her pupils are dilated
to approximately nine millimeters.

510
00:38:33,010 --> 00:38:34,011
Okay.

511
00:38:35,846 --> 00:38:37,189
Let's begin.

512
00:38:44,188 --> 00:38:45,531
Pupils still normal.

513
00:38:45,790 --> 00:38:48,361
Rosa, are you in there?
Can you hear me?

514
00:38:48,859 --> 00:38:51,305
I want to know
how you're feeling today, Rosa.

515
00:38:57,735 --> 00:39:01,547
I remember last time, Rosa,
you were strong. You spoke to me.

516
00:39:07,178 --> 00:39:11,183
No, no, she's strong.
And getting stronger than...

517
00:39:13,417 --> 00:39:14,760
You don't want this one any more.

518
00:39:14,919 --> 00:39:16,592
It's no good for you.

519
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:24,699
She said my name. She said my name.

520
00:39:24,762 --> 00:39:26,605
- How did she know my name?
- Stay back. Don't listen to her.

521
00:39:28,332 --> 00:39:32,803
Five minutes alone with her,
I promise you, her cunt will know me.

522
00:39:34,171 --> 00:39:36,173
I want you to leave the girl out of this.

523
00:39:38,409 --> 00:39:43,085
I know who you are, demon!
Your name is Berith!

524
00:39:43,748 --> 00:39:45,750
Behold the Cross of the Lord.

525
00:39:46,417 --> 00:39:48,090
- Lord, have mercy.
- Lord, have mercy.

526
00:39:48,419 --> 00:39:49,921
- Christ, have mercy.
- Christ, have mercy.

527
00:39:50,020 --> 00:39:51,931
God, the Father of
our Lord Jesus Christ,

528
00:39:52,022 --> 00:39:53,262
I appeal to Your Holy Name

529
00:39:53,324 --> 00:39:55,565
that you graciously
grant me help against...

530
00:40:05,202 --> 00:40:07,045
That you graciously grant me help

531
00:40:07,271 --> 00:40:09,342
against this unclean spirit
that's tormenting this creature of Yours!

532
00:40:09,407 --> 00:40:11,011
Ben, she's hemorrhaging!

533
00:40:11,075 --> 00:40:13,214
God, creator and defender
of the human race,

534
00:40:13,277 --> 00:40:14,654
who made man in Your own image,

535
00:40:14,712 --> 00:40:17,192
look down in pity on this, Your servant!

536
00:40:18,149 --> 00:40:19,924
Help me hold her down, Ben.
Ben, help me hold her down.

537
00:40:19,984 --> 00:40:23,727
Taste it, bitch!
Come taste your mother's sweet milk!

538
00:40:23,788 --> 00:40:24,892
Stay back.

539
00:40:28,292 --> 00:40:29,635
Inserting anti-coagulant.

540
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:32,133
...overwhelms it with fear and panic.

541
00:40:32,630 --> 00:40:35,543
Repel, O Lord, the Devil's power.

542
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:38,273
Break asunder his snares.
You can't hide, Berith!

543
00:40:42,239 --> 00:40:44,651
The Mystery of the Cross
commands you!

544
00:40:44,975 --> 00:40:48,479
Blood pressure's way up, 190 over 110!
Come on, hang in there!

545
00:40:49,313 --> 00:40:53,591
Heart rate's up. So is blood pressure.
190 over 110. Hang in there.

546
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:06,339
Blood pressure's going crazy!
It's 220 over 110! Say it, Ben!

547
00:41:06,497 --> 00:41:08,602
St. Barnabas commands you!

548
00:41:09,166 --> 00:41:11,407
- Ben?
- Just keep hold of her!

549
00:41:15,172 --> 00:41:16,674
Ben, I can't hold her!

550
00:41:19,176 --> 00:41:21,520
- Oh, my God! Where is she?
- David! David!

551
00:41:21,579 --> 00:41:23,752
I can't see! I need light! I need light.

552
00:41:28,619 --> 00:41:30,030
Do something!

553
00:41:30,688 --> 00:41:32,167
Get her back on the bed! Ben!

554
00:41:33,858 --> 00:41:35,701
- Get her legs.
- Michael, get away.

555
00:41:38,696 --> 00:41:43,202
I'll carve out your diseased heart
and eat it!

556
00:41:43,467 --> 00:41:47,813
I have a whole army of angels
and the Lord Almighty by my side!

557
00:41:50,541 --> 00:41:53,044
You want pain? I'll give you pain!

558
00:41:53,377 --> 00:41:55,550
St. Barnabas commands you!

559
00:41:55,813 --> 00:41:58,657
From whose sight you are not hidden!

560
00:41:58,716 --> 00:42:00,696
St. Barnabas commands you!

561
00:42:01,051 --> 00:42:03,224
St. Barnabas commands you!

562
00:42:03,821 --> 00:42:06,062
You foul, treacherous beast!

563
00:42:06,390 --> 00:42:10,065
Give way to Christ,
in whom you found none of your works!

564
00:42:10,394 --> 00:42:12,897
Bow down before God!

565
00:42:19,570 --> 00:42:21,140
Okay, bring her back on her legs.

566
00:42:25,175 --> 00:42:26,586
She's stabilizing.

567
00:42:25,175 --> 00:42:26,779
She's stabilizing.

568
00:42:25,175 --> 00:42:26,677
Turn that off. Yeah.

569
00:42:27,578 --> 00:42:29,182
She's stabilizing.

570
00:42:27,578 --> 00:42:29,080
Turn that off. Yeah.

571
00:42:39,256 --> 00:42:40,758
Turn that off. Yeah.

572
00:42:55,873 --> 00:42:57,546
I don't know what to say.

573
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:05,224
Right there, right there,
you see how her pupil is normal again?

574
00:43:05,282 --> 00:43:06,488
That indicates that she's clean.

575
00:43:06,550 --> 00:43:08,496
Now that you have this,
now you can tell the Church, right,

576
00:43:08,619 --> 00:43:10,064
- That you saved her?
- No.

577
00:43:10,120 --> 00:43:12,794
Yeah, it worked. But that doesn't mean
the Church will support it.

578
00:43:13,057 --> 00:43:15,230
That doesn't make any sense. Why not?

579
00:43:15,459 --> 00:43:16,802
Because...

580
00:43:17,895 --> 00:43:21,069
Because the Church would have us
arrested and deported.

581
00:43:21,131 --> 00:43:23,338
What we're doing in the eyes of
the Church is very wrong.

582
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:25,243
That's why we know it's so right.

583
00:43:29,573 --> 00:43:31,951
Look, her appearance
is completely normal,

584
00:43:32,009 --> 00:43:33,317
and so quickly after the exorcism.

585
00:43:33,377 --> 00:43:36,324
Hello? This is she. Excuse me.

586
00:43:36,981 --> 00:43:38,324
R-O-S-S-I.

587
00:43:38,582 --> 00:43:39,993
- What's that?
- I don't know.

588
00:43:41,986 --> 00:43:44,489
I'm her daughter.
I just got here from America.

589
00:43:44,989 --> 00:43:48,937
I think that's a big mistake. We could
go back to the charts, you'll see that...

590
00:43:48,993 --> 00:43:50,336
This is amazing.

591
00:43:50,494 --> 00:43:51,837
Thank you.

592
00:43:55,666 --> 00:44:00,513
That was the Diocese of Rome.
I asked for a reevaluation of my mother.

593
00:44:00,771 --> 00:44:01,772
What did they say?

594
00:44:02,006 --> 00:44:03,713
They thanked me for my concerns

595
00:44:03,774 --> 00:44:08,450
and said that any interference would
probably jeopardize her well-being.

596
00:44:09,279 --> 00:44:12,783
And that God would be watching us
over these trying times.

597
00:44:13,017 --> 00:44:14,360
Are you all right?

598
00:44:16,520 --> 00:44:17,863
Fine.

599
00:44:19,523 --> 00:44:21,366
I can't believe
the Church turned her down.

600
00:44:21,625 --> 00:44:23,127
Of course they're gonna turn it down.

601
00:44:23,360 --> 00:44:26,534
...go straight to Dr. Costa
with my own doctor, like David.

602
00:44:26,797 --> 00:44:29,107
The hospital
is outside Vatican City walls,

603
00:44:29,166 --> 00:44:31,203
and I think that means
it's out of their jurisdiction.

604
00:44:31,468 --> 00:44:33,812
- What are you two talking about?
- What's that?

605
00:44:34,138 --> 00:44:36,140
What are you talking about?

606
00:44:36,807 --> 00:44:39,151
- Okay. Okay.
- We need to talk.

607
00:44:39,476 --> 00:44:41,649
- David? Do you have a sec? Okay.
- Yeah.

608
00:44:42,479 --> 00:44:44,356
We don't know what's wrong
with Isabella's mother.

609
00:44:44,415 --> 00:44:47,624
Nobody does because she hasn't been
evaluated in over 15 years.

610
00:44:47,818 --> 00:44:49,820
She deserves a second opinion.

611
00:44:50,054 --> 00:44:51,192
A second opinion?

612
00:44:51,255 --> 00:44:52,996
It would give us enough time
to determine her condition.

613
00:44:53,057 --> 00:44:55,435
No, you want to give an exorcism
to Isabella's mother.

614
00:44:55,492 --> 00:44:56,596
That's not what we're saying.

615
00:44:56,660 --> 00:44:59,231
We just need time and we need to know
that she's actually possessed.

616
00:44:59,296 --> 00:45:01,105
Yeah, then she can get
the proper attention.

617
00:45:01,165 --> 00:45:02,735
Look, okay, that's not how this works.

618
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:04,837
You're here to document,
you're not here to get involved.

619
00:45:04,902 --> 00:45:06,438
- First of all, it's illegal.
- No, it's not illegal.

620
00:45:06,570 --> 00:45:08,607
Yes, Ben, it is!
And in the eyes of the Church...

621
00:45:08,672 --> 00:45:10,049
You know, forget about the Church,
David!

622
00:45:10,107 --> 00:45:11,745
Why does it always come down to that?

623
00:45:11,842 --> 00:45:14,721
What if this works?
What if we find out that it's not D.I.D.?

624
00:45:14,912 --> 00:45:16,357
Yeah, think about it, David.
This could work.

625
00:45:16,413 --> 00:45:17,687
Michael, I know what you're doing.

626
00:45:17,748 --> 00:45:20,058
I know it would be provocative
for your film, but we will be arrested.

627
00:45:23,754 --> 00:45:25,563
How would it even work?

628
00:45:25,622 --> 00:45:28,102
As soon as they found out what we
were doing, they'd shut us down.

629
00:45:28,225 --> 00:45:30,865
The staff won't be allowed with us
in the room.

630
00:45:30,928 --> 00:45:35,104
Yeah, we should have that right
to privacy on her behalf, right?

631
00:45:36,433 --> 00:45:38,435
Yeah, you're right.

632
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:44,885
David, just...

633
00:45:46,443 --> 00:45:48,787
What if it was your own mother?

634
00:45:55,052 --> 00:45:56,395
I'm really nervous.

635
00:45:55,052 --> 00:45:58,397
I'm an active priest
in good standing with the Holy See.

636
00:45:56,653 --> 00:45:59,998
I'm an active priest
in good standing with the Holy See.

637
00:46:00,224 --> 00:46:03,637
And regardless of the outcome,
the Church will find out,

638
00:46:03,694 --> 00:46:05,605
and it will put my job in jeopardy.

639
00:46:05,829 --> 00:46:06,830
Father Ben Rawlings.

640
00:46:06,997 --> 00:46:07,998
<i>But at the same time,</i>

641
00:46:08,232 --> 00:46:09,609
there are problems
within this institution.

642
00:46:09,666 --> 00:46:11,043
There are things that I don't agree with.

643
00:46:11,335 --> 00:46:13,178
<i>In the case of Maria Rossi,</i>

644
00:46:13,403 --> 00:46:16,077
<i>I think we should take the time
to actively deduce whether or not</i>

645
00:46:16,140 --> 00:46:18,643
she's being tormented
by an evil presence.

646
00:46:20,911 --> 00:46:22,254
I think.

647
00:46:23,347 --> 00:46:26,157
<i>What's the Church's stance
on Maria Rossi?</i>

648
00:46:26,316 --> 00:46:28,762
Well, she's faded into the system.

649
00:46:28,819 --> 00:46:30,765
She's pumped full of drugs
and forgotten.

650
00:46:31,188 --> 00:46:36,194
If she becomes too difficult,
there's a panic button on the wall.

651
00:46:36,360 --> 00:46:38,203
- Yeah?
- Yes, I saw that. Thank you.

652
00:46:38,362 --> 00:46:42,435
The bottom line here is that something
horrible happened back in 1989.

653
00:46:42,699 --> 00:46:44,406
And it wasn't Maria Rossi's fault.

654
00:46:44,468 --> 00:46:48,280
You'll be screening her using SCID-D?
Two hours?

655
00:46:48,338 --> 00:46:50,784
More or less two hours, yeah. I'd say so.

656
00:46:50,974 --> 00:46:53,079
I feel the Church needs to change.

657
00:46:53,310 --> 00:46:58,191
<i>We're so eager to just brush things
under the carpet as if they don't exist.</i>

658
00:46:58,515 --> 00:47:01,655
<i>I don't fit in this Church,
in this guise of the Church.</i>

659
00:47:01,919 --> 00:47:04,160
And I have to do what I believe.

660
00:47:04,488 --> 00:47:05,660
<i>I'll see you soon, Maria.</i>

661
00:47:09,893 --> 00:47:11,804
<i>I know it's dangerous,
and it might not even work.</i>

662
00:47:12,296 --> 00:47:15,300
But I can't just sit back and do nothing.

663
00:47:23,140 --> 00:47:24,676
Okay, not a problem.

664
00:47:28,946 --> 00:47:34,157
The time is 8:32 a.m.
on Monday, December 7, 2009.

665
00:47:34,218 --> 00:47:37,461
Subject is Maria Rossi. Session one.

666
00:47:38,622 --> 00:47:40,863
Subject appears docile.

667
00:47:41,124 --> 00:47:42,967
Heavily medicated.

668
00:47:45,462 --> 00:47:49,842
Pupils are mildly dilated
due to the medication.

669
00:47:50,467 --> 00:47:52,344
Okay. Let's wake her up.

670
00:47:52,870 --> 00:47:56,545
When she wakes up,
we'll see if she gets a reaction.

671
00:47:58,141 --> 00:47:59,814
Counteracting medication.

672
00:48:01,311 --> 00:48:04,053
Medication should take effect
in 20 seconds.

673
00:48:04,548 --> 00:48:07,154
- So this is when you provoke her?
- Exactly.

674
00:48:08,051 --> 00:48:09,724
Ten seconds.

675
00:48:12,556 --> 00:48:16,129
Five, four, three,

676
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:19,404
two, time.

677
00:48:21,164 --> 00:48:22,199
Maria?

678
00:48:25,736 --> 00:48:27,579
Maria, do you know what this is?

679
00:48:31,408 --> 00:48:33,752
Maria, is there someone
in there with you?

680
00:48:34,845 --> 00:48:36,256
I don't know.

681
00:48:36,747 --> 00:48:38,920
Yes, you do, Maria.

682
00:48:39,516 --> 00:48:40,859
Who's in there?

683
00:48:41,084 --> 00:48:43,587
We can help you.
We can free you from it.

684
00:48:43,921 --> 00:48:45,525
EKG is normal.

685
00:48:46,423 --> 00:48:48,096
They'll be angry.

686
00:48:48,592 --> 00:48:50,196
There's more than one?

687
00:48:59,703 --> 00:49:01,205
Maybe she's clean.

688
00:49:04,207 --> 00:49:05,584
What was that?

689
00:49:05,909 --> 00:49:07,252
Yeah, we got something.

690
00:49:10,280 --> 00:49:11,725
Her pupil's still normal.

691
00:49:14,952 --> 00:49:16,295
It's nothing.

692
00:49:20,924 --> 00:49:22,267
Is she all right?

693
00:49:22,592 --> 00:49:23,935
Yeah, she...

694
00:49:26,430 --> 00:49:28,103
She's sleeping.

695
00:49:28,365 --> 00:49:32,074
That's the first time
I've seen a possessed person

696
00:49:32,803 --> 00:49:36,148
fall asleep when confronted by
a priest and holy water.

697
00:49:36,473 --> 00:49:38,077
What does that mean?

698
00:49:39,643 --> 00:49:41,714
I don't know. I think...

699
00:49:43,547 --> 00:49:44,992
I think we might be wasting our time.

700
00:49:45,048 --> 00:49:48,257
I came here for her and I'm going to do
everything I can to help her.

701
00:49:48,318 --> 00:49:51,925
This isn't consistent with any form
of possession that I've ever seen.

702
00:49:51,989 --> 00:49:53,468
I'm sorry, Isabella. This...

703
00:50:00,230 --> 00:50:01,732
Her pupils are almost fully dilated!

704
00:50:01,798 --> 00:50:03,778
Lord, have mercy! Christ, have mercy!

705
00:50:03,834 --> 00:50:05,438
- What are you doing?
- We're helping her, David!

706
00:50:05,502 --> 00:50:06,640
We need to help her!

707
00:50:06,703 --> 00:50:08,910
- Ben, this is not the time or the place!
- Stay back.

708
00:50:09,039 --> 00:50:10,177
I need you to calm down.

709
00:50:10,640 --> 00:50:12,313
- Christ, have mercy.
- Christ, have mercy.

710
00:50:12,609 --> 00:50:14,020
- Christ, hear us.
- Christ, please hear us.

711
00:50:14,277 --> 00:50:16,314
God, the Father in Heaven.

712
00:50:17,447 --> 00:50:20,360
I know you! I know you, little girl!

713
00:50:20,550 --> 00:50:21,620
God, the Father in Heaven.

714
00:50:21,685 --> 00:50:22,891
God, the Father in Heaven,
most merciful.

715
00:50:22,953 --> 00:50:24,523
God, the Father of
our Lord Jesus Christ,

716
00:50:24,588 --> 00:50:25,965
I appeal to Your Holy Name.

717
00:50:26,189 --> 00:50:28,430
- Against this unclean spirit!
- I know you!

718
00:50:34,498 --> 00:50:38,844
Shove that needle in your fucking eye,
you faggot!

719
00:50:41,204 --> 00:50:44,151
I adjure you, ancient serpent

720
00:50:45,976 --> 00:50:48,980
by the judge of the living
and of the dead.

721
00:50:49,079 --> 00:50:50,922
- Don't get too close.
- By your Creator...

722
00:50:50,981 --> 00:50:53,222
- Ben? Ben?
- Michael!

723
00:50:53,550 --> 00:50:55,996
The faith of the holy apostles
and of all the saints commands you,

724
00:50:56,053 --> 00:50:57,964
- Reveal yourself before the Creator!
- Watch it!

725
00:50:59,589 --> 00:51:00,659
David!

726
00:51:00,724 --> 00:51:03,796
The devout prayers of holy men...

727
00:51:04,127 --> 00:51:06,129
God the Father commands you!

728
00:51:06,296 --> 00:51:09,470
You can't get back
in your God's good graces, priest.

729
00:51:09,800 --> 00:51:12,212
Not after what you did.

730
00:51:16,473 --> 00:51:19,147
- Ben, what are you doing?
- Her vitals are going crazy.

731
00:51:24,214 --> 00:51:25,386
Get back. Get back.

732
00:51:25,882 --> 00:51:27,725
Michael, put the camera down and help!

733
00:51:27,984 --> 00:51:28,985
I want to help her!

734
00:51:29,319 --> 00:51:30,992
Get her leg! Get her leg!

735
00:51:32,956 --> 00:51:34,833
Careful. Grab her leg!

736
00:51:35,225 --> 00:51:37,000
I got her. Get her arm.

737
00:51:39,062 --> 00:51:40,735
Isabella, is it locked?

738
00:51:40,997 --> 00:51:43,238
- Close the bolt!
- Yes! Yes!

739
00:51:46,870 --> 00:51:48,042
Tell me your name, coward!

740
00:51:48,238 --> 00:51:49,239
Asbeel!

741
00:51:51,708 --> 00:51:55,155
Come that close to me one more time
and I'll use your tongue

742
00:51:55,212 --> 00:51:59,786
to skull fuck the baby killer over there!

743
00:52:01,251 --> 00:52:06,633
<i>The itsy bitsy spider
came down the water spout.</i>

744
00:52:07,424 --> 00:52:12,430
<i>Down came the rain
and washed the spider out.</i>

745
00:52:12,896 --> 00:52:14,273
<i>Out came the sun...</i>

746
00:52:14,331 --> 00:52:17,335
Isabella, don't listen to it.
It's not your mother.

747
00:52:17,767 --> 00:52:19,747
- Come on, baby.
- Isabella, it's not your mother!

748
00:52:19,803 --> 00:52:21,248
You know the words.

749
00:52:21,438 --> 00:52:23,111
Isabella, snap out of it!

750
00:52:23,607 --> 00:52:24,984
- Do it!
- Demons!

751
00:52:24,985 --> 00:52:27,111
You are guilty
before our Lord Jesus Christ.

752
00:52:28,044 --> 00:52:31,548
You are guilty
before our Lord Jesus Christ

753
00:52:31,781 --> 00:52:34,057
whom you dared to nail upon the cross.

754
00:52:34,284 --> 00:52:37,458
Pulse is 284. Rhythm is way off.

755
00:52:39,289 --> 00:52:40,734
I'm not like the others, demon!

756
00:52:40,891 --> 00:52:42,234
Do you hear me, transgressor?

757
00:52:42,392 --> 00:52:43,962
- I hear you, priest.
- Seducer!

758
00:52:44,127 --> 00:52:47,074
All you fucking do is talk!

759
00:52:48,231 --> 00:52:51,405
The holy apostles Peter and Paul
and all the saints command you.

760
00:52:51,635 --> 00:52:55,640
Give way to Christ,
in whom you found none of your works!

761
00:52:55,972 --> 00:52:58,976
For it is not He who condemns you,

762
00:52:59,042 --> 00:53:01,989
but rather He
who rules the living and the dead.

763
00:53:02,245 --> 00:53:04,316
Our Father, who art in heaven...

764
00:53:04,581 --> 00:53:08,256
- No, it's gonna kill her!
- Just stay there, Isabella.

765
00:53:10,921 --> 00:53:11,922
No, no, no.

766
00:53:13,423 --> 00:53:16,029
For thine is the kingdom,
and the power, and the glory,

767
00:53:16,326 --> 00:53:17,862
for ever and ever. Amen.

768
00:53:18,395 --> 00:53:21,035
Let my mother go.

769
00:53:23,967 --> 00:53:25,310
You'll burn.

770
00:53:26,836 --> 00:53:28,838
You'll burn eternal.

771
00:53:30,607 --> 00:53:32,450
Poor child.

772
00:53:41,017 --> 00:53:44,226
- Please, open this door now!
- Pulse is dropping.

773
00:53:44,621 --> 00:53:47,033
Maria? Maria, can you hear us?

774
00:53:47,290 --> 00:53:51,966
Starting to regain consciousness.
Temp is returning to normal.

775
00:53:57,467 --> 00:53:58,502
Over.

776
00:54:02,339 --> 00:54:04,341
<i>- Tell me your name, coward!
- Asbeel!</i>

777
00:54:07,210 --> 00:54:09,053
I'll be feeling that tomorrow.

778
00:54:09,246 --> 00:54:12,159
See, this is preternatural movement
right here.

779
00:54:12,215 --> 00:54:13,888
I've seen it before,
but I've never captured it on tape.

780
00:54:14,150 --> 00:54:15,652
So, what does that mean?

781
00:54:15,885 --> 00:54:19,662
It means we've got
everything that we need right here.

782
00:54:19,990 --> 00:54:21,833
This is huge, Isabella.

783
00:54:23,393 --> 00:54:24,497
Let's play it again.

784
00:54:25,228 --> 00:54:27,401
Do you realize how big this is?

785
00:54:27,664 --> 00:54:28,665
With the evidence we've got,

786
00:54:28,732 --> 00:54:30,678
the Holy See has to see us.
They have to.

787
00:54:30,900 --> 00:54:32,538
We can go to the press with this

788
00:54:32,602 --> 00:54:35,583
and in an instant, we'd have
1,000 people standing out there.

789
00:54:35,839 --> 00:54:39,013
Our priority right now
should be getting her back to the States.

790
00:54:39,509 --> 00:54:41,511
The endorsement of Dr. Costa is vital.

791
00:54:41,745 --> 00:54:45,090
But after the results that he saw,
there's no way that he can't agree.

792
00:54:45,348 --> 00:54:47,851
Dr. Costa doesn't believe
that she was possessed or anything.

793
00:54:47,917 --> 00:54:51,091
He thinks it was an exercise
that shocked her system.

794
00:54:51,521 --> 00:54:53,523
Anyway, it doesn't matter
what he believes

795
00:54:53,590 --> 00:54:56,400
because his referral's actually gonna
help us get her back to the States.

796
00:54:56,526 --> 00:55:01,236
<i>You can't get back
in your God's good graces, priest.</i>

797
00:55:01,364 --> 00:55:02,707
What are you doing?

798
00:55:04,601 --> 00:55:06,274
I'm just...

799
00:55:07,370 --> 00:55:11,216
I'm just analyzing Maria's audio.

800
00:55:11,274 --> 00:55:15,916
I'm just trying to work out if there is
more than one voice inside her.

801
00:55:16,880 --> 00:55:18,223
See, there can...

802
00:55:21,217 --> 00:55:24,721
See? See? Right there. You hear that?

803
00:55:27,557 --> 00:55:30,401
- She's speaking in tongues, right?
- No, no.

804
00:55:30,894 --> 00:55:35,400
It's one sentence, spoken in
more than one language, I think.

805
00:55:35,632 --> 00:55:37,634
I'm just trying to isolate how many.

806
00:55:43,940 --> 00:55:47,319
<i>You wanted him to die, didn't you?</i>

807
00:55:47,644 --> 00:55:48,987
Ben, what is she talking about?

808
00:55:49,112 --> 00:55:51,456
<i>You wanted him to die, didn't you?</i>

809
00:55:51,815 --> 00:55:54,659
Is she talking about your uncle?

810
00:56:00,490 --> 00:56:03,869
I found four voices on the recording.
I found four voices on the recording.

811
00:56:03,927 --> 00:56:05,998
- You found four?
- Wait, what does that mean?

812
00:56:06,162 --> 00:56:09,769
It means that the entity
in your mother had disciples.

813
00:56:09,999 --> 00:56:11,706
We call it multiple demonic possession.

814
00:56:11,768 --> 00:56:14,874
You might have heard
Gallo talking about it in class.

815
00:56:14,938 --> 00:56:17,282
Wait, so it's a powerful demon.

816
00:56:17,607 --> 00:56:19,609
Yeah. It's a beast.

817
00:56:22,011 --> 00:56:24,116
- What?
- You know how lucky we are?

818
00:56:24,447 --> 00:56:29,294
Look, we're gonna deliver all our
findings to the Holy See next Friday.

819
00:56:29,352 --> 00:56:30,729
Yeah, maybe.
He hasn't agreed to see us.

820
00:56:30,787 --> 00:56:33,028
Yeah, well, have you told him that
the press might be interested?

821
00:56:33,089 --> 00:56:34,568
That's not very diplomatic.

822
00:56:34,624 --> 00:56:36,695
Can't we just wait a little bit
till my mother's case is resolved?

823
00:56:36,760 --> 00:56:37,898
I mean, the press?

824
00:56:37,961 --> 00:56:40,635
Hang on a minute. Just because
you've got what you want now,

825
00:56:40,697 --> 00:56:43,644
you're expecting us just to keep quiet?
Michael, please, just get...

826
00:56:43,700 --> 00:56:45,407
Stop! Stop! That's not what I meant!

827
00:56:45,468 --> 00:56:47,778
Because there are lot more
people to help

828
00:56:47,837 --> 00:56:49,316
rather than just your mother, okay?

829
00:56:49,372 --> 00:56:51,545
- Wait, did Father Gallo call you?
- What's your problem?

830
00:56:52,976 --> 00:56:54,319
No. You?

831
00:56:54,544 --> 00:56:56,148
Yeah, he called me twice.

832
00:56:59,215 --> 00:57:00,523
What did he say?

833
00:57:00,583 --> 00:57:02,995
He wants to help us
make the right decision.

834
00:57:03,052 --> 00:57:05,498
He's worried about us.
Especially, he's worried about me.

835
00:57:05,555 --> 00:57:07,899
- You? Why?
- Because of my job, Ben.

836
00:57:09,492 --> 00:57:11,665
David, what are you doing
with the papers? Are you okay?

837
00:57:11,895 --> 00:57:14,671
I'm fine. The conversation's just
giving me a little bit of a headache.

838
00:57:14,731 --> 00:57:17,041
David, he's just trying to scare you.
That's all.

839
00:57:17,100 --> 00:57:18,135
- Is that blood?
- He's a moral man.

840
00:57:18,201 --> 00:57:20,044
And he's toeing the company line
on this one and you know it.

841
00:57:20,103 --> 00:57:21,776
Is your nose bleeding?

842
00:57:22,071 --> 00:57:24,745
David, you got something.
Are you okay?

843
00:57:25,241 --> 00:57:28,415
- Are you okay?
- I'm sorry. I'm fine.

844
00:57:34,751 --> 00:57:35,923
Look.

845
00:57:36,586 --> 00:57:37,758
I'm sorry.

846
00:57:39,255 --> 00:57:41,132
It's probably stress.

847
00:57:41,191 --> 00:57:43,899
- It's a lot of work to do for Friday.
- Yeah.

848
00:57:48,865 --> 00:57:50,299
Are you all right?

849
00:57:57,040 --> 00:57:58,519
- They won't release her.
- What?

850
00:57:58,775 --> 00:58:00,914
- Why not?
- I don't know. They won't say.

851
00:58:01,144 --> 00:58:03,988
They can't or won't believe
that she's better.

852
00:58:10,053 --> 00:58:11,498
- Where are my keys?
- I don't...

853
00:58:13,389 --> 00:58:15,391
Where are my fucking keys?
They were right here.

854
00:58:15,458 --> 00:58:17,631
- I don't know. Relax.
- Where are my fucking keys, Michael?

855
00:58:18,127 --> 00:58:20,801
I don't know.
It feels like they'll never release her.

856
00:58:23,833 --> 00:58:27,178
There's no way
the Church can't see this.

857
00:58:27,237 --> 00:58:30,810
I can look them in the eye and tell them
that it was the right thing to do.

858
00:58:45,355 --> 00:58:48,165
This is what they do.
They cover things up, they ignore it,

859
00:58:48,591 --> 00:58:50,366
no matter who it hurts or destroys.

860
00:58:50,426 --> 00:58:52,531
Well, not this time.
Not this fucking time.

861
00:58:52,595 --> 00:58:55,701
This was supposed to be
about my mother. Not anybody else.

862
00:58:55,765 --> 00:58:59,042
Not about Ben's ego, or David's job.

863
00:58:59,102 --> 00:59:03,949
I have a sinking feeling I'm going to be
excommunicated for all this. I think.

864
00:59:05,008 --> 00:59:06,316
For what we did.

865
00:59:06,476 --> 00:59:08,353
David's inner coward
is really coming out.

866
00:59:08,511 --> 00:59:10,752
Ben and David, maybe I get them.

867
00:59:11,114 --> 00:59:14,618
They have their own thing going on,
but Isabella,

868
00:59:15,285 --> 00:59:16,286
we started this together.

869
00:59:16,519 --> 00:59:19,022
Michael just has to stop.

870
00:59:19,522 --> 00:59:20,865
He just wants to...

871
00:59:21,124 --> 00:59:24,196
They have this group of three

872
00:59:24,260 --> 00:59:27,605
and I'm like
the annoying guy with the camera.

873
00:59:36,873 --> 00:59:39,547
David, what the fuck are you doing?

874
00:59:41,077 --> 00:59:42,522
If it weren't for me

875
00:59:42,745 --> 00:59:45,316
no one would know anything
about what the hell they're doing

876
00:59:45,381 --> 00:59:48,919
in their Church and in their basements.

877
00:59:49,752 --> 00:59:53,165
Look, I really think we need to talk
about some stuff.

878
01:00:11,374 --> 01:00:14,287
- What's wrong with the camera?
- I don't know. Just...

879
01:00:14,611 --> 01:00:15,646
What's wrong?

880
01:00:15,712 --> 01:00:18,022
- Not then. Before she hit you.
- Michael, did you see anything?

881
01:00:18,081 --> 01:00:19,219
No, I didn't see anything.

882
01:00:19,449 --> 01:00:21,520
- Okay, we'll just try another...
- This is something else.

883
01:00:21,951 --> 01:00:23,487
Yeah, but it's at the exact same time.

884
01:00:23,553 --> 01:00:27,729
It must have been just a power surge
through the hospital.

885
01:00:27,790 --> 01:00:29,030
It's the only thing I can think of.

886
01:00:29,092 --> 01:00:31,299
For all the cameras?
It could be something else.

887
01:00:31,361 --> 01:00:33,500
- Hey, we're filming.
- I'm sorry.

888
01:00:33,563 --> 01:00:35,406
- David, you have to see this.
- I have to go.

889
01:00:35,632 --> 01:00:38,977
- I said we're filming.
- I know. I heard you. I got to go.

890
01:00:39,235 --> 01:00:40,407
What's the matter?

891
01:00:40,470 --> 01:00:43,610
- The bishop denied our request.
- What?

892
01:00:43,973 --> 01:00:48,479
It's just a bloody meeting.
What was the reason?

893
01:00:49,412 --> 01:00:51,585
The incident's under investigation.

894
01:00:51,814 --> 01:00:53,953
- Well, of course it is.
- David...

895
01:00:54,117 --> 01:00:56,028
- David.
- Yeah?

896
01:00:56,285 --> 01:00:58,458
- It's going to be okay. All right?
- I hope so.

897
01:00:59,622 --> 01:01:01,568
- I hope so.
- David, wait, wait.

898
01:01:01,624 --> 01:01:03,661
I'm coming with you, remember?
The baptism?

899
01:01:03,726 --> 01:01:05,137
Come on. Let's go.

900
01:01:06,696 --> 01:01:08,903
- Michael, how long is this going to take?
- Just a second.

901
01:01:08,965 --> 01:01:11,138
- Do we really need this?
- Yep.

902
01:01:11,801 --> 01:01:14,748
- Are you okay with that, David?
- I'm fine. You ready?

903
01:01:15,938 --> 01:01:18,441
<i>Baptism, baptism.</i>

904
01:01:18,808 --> 01:01:22,620
Baptism is the transferal of sins,

905
01:01:23,446 --> 01:01:25,619
<i>both original and personal.</i>

906
01:01:26,282 --> 01:01:27,625
<i>Now, for example,</i>

907
01:01:27,984 --> 01:01:31,693
<i>if a baby were to die
after being baptized</i>

908
01:01:31,954 --> 01:01:33,456
it would go to Heaven.

909
01:01:34,457 --> 01:01:36,130
And if before

910
01:01:36,526 --> 01:01:37,971
it would go to Hell.

911
01:01:41,631 --> 01:01:44,635
<i>In the name of the Father and of the Son
and of the Holy Spirit.</i>

912
01:01:46,636 --> 01:01:49,344
Brethren, our fair Father Christ
in His great loving kindness

913
01:01:49,405 --> 01:01:52,579
hath ordained that His mystic bride,
the Holy Mother of the Church,

914
01:01:53,209 --> 01:01:56,053
to protect her children at every stage
from the cradle to the grave.

915
01:01:56,279 --> 01:01:59,283
And to this end is the Sacrament
of Holy Baptism ordained.

916
01:01:59,549 --> 01:02:00,892
Amen.

917
01:02:06,723 --> 01:02:09,567
John Thomas,
in the name of Christ our Lord

918
01:02:09,792 --> 01:02:12,739
I anoint thee with oil for thy safekeeping.

919
01:02:32,081 --> 01:02:33,754
John Thomas,

920
01:02:34,250 --> 01:02:35,923
I baptize you

921
01:02:36,252 --> 01:02:40,257
in the name of the Father,
and of the Son

922
01:02:41,090 --> 01:02:42,763
and of the Holy Spirit.

923
01:02:46,896 --> 01:02:48,967
David? What's he doing?

924
01:02:51,434 --> 01:02:52,469
David!

925
01:02:52,635 --> 01:02:53,978
- Father, stop.
- Please stop!

926
01:02:54,237 --> 01:02:55,807
What are you doing, David?

927
01:02:56,439 --> 01:02:58,316
David, stop, stop!

928
01:02:59,809 --> 01:03:01,152
David! For God's sake!

929
01:03:01,477 --> 01:03:03,514
Somebody, stop him!

930
01:03:07,817 --> 01:03:10,093
You know what I'd like to do?

931
01:03:12,421 --> 01:03:15,163
I'd like to take this fucking camera,

932
01:03:16,159 --> 01:03:19,265
turn it around
and stick it in Michael's face.

933
01:03:21,497 --> 01:03:24,842
I'd like to ask him,
"What was it like, Michael?"

934
01:03:27,003 --> 01:03:28,846
"What was it like when"

935
01:03:30,106 --> 01:03:33,178
"your mom fucked
your father's best friend?"

936
01:03:41,350 --> 01:03:42,522
David?

937
01:03:43,920 --> 01:03:45,729
Hey, David!

938
01:03:52,361 --> 01:03:55,467
Michael, what's wrong with David?
What's happened?

939
01:03:59,869 --> 01:04:01,371
What's going on?

940
01:04:09,045 --> 01:04:10,217
The...

941
01:04:11,214 --> 01:04:12,887
The kid almost died.

942
01:04:13,216 --> 01:04:14,388
What?

943
01:04:15,218 --> 01:04:17,858
What happened? What did you say?

944
01:04:19,055 --> 01:04:22,400
The baby he was baptizing,
he almost drowned it.

945
01:04:24,060 --> 01:04:27,098
- What are you doing?
- Setting up the camera.

946
01:04:27,163 --> 01:04:30,007
- No, wait. Just leave the camera.
- Is the baby okay?

947
01:04:30,566 --> 01:04:31,738
Yeah, I think so.

948
01:04:32,001 --> 01:04:34,106
You think so? Did you see it?
Were you there or not?

949
01:04:34,170 --> 01:04:35,581
Do I think the baby's okay? Yeah.

950
01:04:35,838 --> 01:04:37,511
Is he in trouble?

951
01:04:38,007 --> 01:04:40,317
I don't know.
They called the police and he just left.

952
01:04:40,376 --> 01:04:42,219
- David!
- Okay, just come back when you...

953
01:04:42,745 --> 01:04:47,751
Well, he's been acting strange all day.
Did you see it happen?

954
01:04:48,584 --> 01:04:52,589
See it? I filmed it! It
was like he lost it!

955
01:04:53,256 --> 01:04:57,432
He's been under a lot of stress lately,
so maybe that contributed to...

956
01:04:57,760 --> 01:04:59,364
I don't know.
You should have been there.

957
01:04:59,428 --> 01:05:01,430
It was like he was crazy!

958
01:05:02,198 --> 01:05:03,233
Has anything like this
ever happened before?

959
01:05:03,299 --> 01:05:04,334
No, of course not!

960
01:05:06,269 --> 01:05:07,441
- David!
- David?

961
01:05:07,536 --> 01:05:08,571
What the hell's going on?

962
01:05:08,638 --> 01:05:10,379
Michael, get the camera.
We need the light.

963
01:05:11,540 --> 01:05:13,816
- Ben?
- David?

964
01:05:18,447 --> 01:05:19,619
David?

965
01:05:22,618 --> 01:05:24,620
What's he doing up there?

966
01:05:36,632 --> 01:05:38,305
Watch. Careful.

967
01:05:46,475 --> 01:05:48,477
- What the hell is all this?
- I don't know.

968
01:05:48,744 --> 01:05:50,917
Ben, are those Bible pages?

969
01:05:51,647 --> 01:05:53,456
- Oh, Jesus.
- David!

970
01:05:53,716 --> 01:05:54,888
Come here. What have you done?

971
01:05:54,951 --> 01:05:56,453
Oh, my God, Ben.
He's bleeding all over.

972
01:05:56,519 --> 01:05:59,022
Get his arms up.
Put them up. Put them up.

973
01:06:00,156 --> 01:06:01,499
- No, no, no.
- What is it?

974
01:06:02,558 --> 01:06:03,696
No, no, no.

975
01:06:06,829 --> 01:06:09,309
- What do we do, Ben?
- I don't know!

976
01:06:09,365 --> 01:06:10,810
- What do you mean, you don't know?
- I don't know.

977
01:06:10,866 --> 01:06:12,277
I don't know what to do!

978
01:06:13,803 --> 01:06:14,804
Where's...

979
01:06:20,843 --> 01:06:23,517
Go, go, go! Get out! Stay out!

980
01:06:23,646 --> 01:06:25,785
Stay downstairs!
Don't come back upstairs again!

981
01:06:25,915 --> 01:06:26,950
Just stay down there!

982
01:06:27,016 --> 01:06:28,859
- Okay, okay.
- Look at me. Look in my eyes.

983
01:06:28,918 --> 01:06:31,057
Michael, did you see his eyes?
Did you see his eyes?

984
01:06:31,620 --> 01:06:32,621
Shit!

985
01:06:33,856 --> 01:06:34,857
No, no.

986
01:06:36,192 --> 01:06:38,536
Father Keane?
Where is Father David Keane?

987
01:06:38,694 --> 01:06:40,571
- He's upstairs.
- He's very, very sick.

988
01:06:41,063 --> 01:06:43,043
- Turn on the lights.
- I can't.

989
01:06:43,099 --> 01:06:44,942
This is the only light we have.

990
01:06:45,668 --> 01:06:47,170
- Are you David Keane?
- No, no.

991
01:06:47,403 --> 01:06:50,577
He's upstairs, he's upstairs,
but it's not safe to go up there!

992
01:06:50,639 --> 01:06:52,016
Stay down here, please!

993
01:06:52,074 --> 01:06:53,747
Holy shit.

994
01:06:54,910 --> 01:06:56,253
Do you need the light?

995
01:07:06,088 --> 01:07:07,260
David!

996
01:07:17,366 --> 01:07:19,778
- He took your gun?
- Yes, he took my gun!

997
01:07:19,835 --> 01:07:20,836
We need to get out right now.

998
01:07:20,903 --> 01:07:22,780
All of us need to get out. We need to...

999
01:07:23,205 --> 01:07:24,548
David? David?

1000
01:07:25,341 --> 01:07:26,342
David?

1001
01:07:26,542 --> 01:07:28,283
He's my friend!

1002
01:07:29,779 --> 01:07:33,454
David? David, listen to me.
Put down the gun.

1003
01:07:34,617 --> 01:07:37,359
- Just put down the gun, yeah?
- David...

1004
01:07:37,453 --> 01:07:40,798
Listen to me. It's Ben, okay?
It's your friend.

1005
01:07:41,424 --> 01:07:43,597
- No, no!
- Be quiet, Isabella.

1006
01:07:43,926 --> 01:07:46,930
David, listen to me, all right?

1007
01:07:46,996 --> 01:07:50,534
This isn't you.
Just listen to my voice, okay?

1008
01:07:51,133 --> 01:07:53,135
This is your friend, Ben.

1009
01:07:54,303 --> 01:07:55,805
This isn't you.

1010
01:07:56,405 --> 01:07:58,407
Something else
has taken control of you.

1011
01:07:58,474 --> 01:08:00,920
You know this. You know this.

1012
01:08:02,511 --> 01:08:03,546
Okay?

1013
01:08:03,612 --> 01:08:07,287
Focus on my voice.
You need to trust me, David. Okay?

1014
01:08:08,117 --> 01:08:09,619
Just stay calm.

1015
01:08:11,087 --> 01:08:14,625
I can't stop. I can't stop it, Ben!

1016
01:08:14,890 --> 01:08:18,337
You can, you can fight it.
Just fight it! Fight it, David.

1017
01:08:18,828 --> 01:08:22,002
Our Father, who art in Heaven,

1018
01:08:22,331 --> 01:08:24,004
hallowed be Thy name.

1019
01:08:24,333 --> 01:08:28,008
Thy kingdom come,
Thy will be done on earth...

1020
01:08:35,478 --> 01:08:36,479
I forgot it.

1021
01:08:36,679 --> 01:08:39,023
- Just give me the gun.
- I forgot it.

1022
01:08:39,348 --> 01:08:41,350
He says to say, "Thank you".

1023
01:08:43,152 --> 01:08:44,529
Jesus!

1024
01:08:45,020 --> 01:08:46,522
The light!

1025
01:08:50,960 --> 01:08:52,667
Come here, come here. Oh, shit.

1026
01:08:56,866 --> 01:08:58,038
Fuck!

1027
01:09:00,870 --> 01:09:02,543
I need an ambulance now!

1028
01:09:02,805 --> 01:09:04,375
What's wrong with her?

1029
01:09:05,207 --> 01:09:07,809
She's having a seizure. Come here.

1030
01:09:09,545 --> 01:09:11,047
You saw his eyes, right?

1031
01:09:13,048 --> 01:09:15,221
- Ben!
- I saw his eyes!

1032
01:09:15,317 --> 01:09:16,728
- Tell me what's happening, Ben!
- I don't want to...

1033
01:09:16,785 --> 01:09:17,991
I got to know what's happening, Ben!

1034
01:09:18,387 --> 01:09:19,991
Maybe there's some

1035
01:09:21,157 --> 01:09:22,329
transference.

1036
01:09:22,558 --> 01:09:24,060
Demonic transference?

1037
01:09:24,160 --> 01:09:27,232
Of course I mean demonic transference,
Michael!

1038
01:09:27,496 --> 01:09:28,839
- Transference like?
- Just fucking...

1039
01:09:29,031 --> 01:09:31,705
- Michael, please just shut the fuck up!
- Don't you fucking yell at me, Ben!

1040
01:09:31,901 --> 01:09:33,608
Of course I'm gonna fucking yell at you!

1041
01:09:33,669 --> 01:09:35,512
You've been here
the whole fucking time!

1042
01:09:35,738 --> 01:09:37,411
Have you not listened to me?

1043
01:09:38,073 --> 01:09:39,416
Jesus.

1044
01:09:42,745 --> 01:09:46,090
No, no! Please, wait here.
Wait out there! Yes, please.

1045
01:10:10,906 --> 01:10:12,408
Her name is Isabella Rossi.

1046
01:10:13,509 --> 01:10:14,920
Can we see her yet?

1047
01:10:42,871 --> 01:10:44,873
I believe there's transference.

1048
01:10:46,442 --> 01:10:50,185
- I don't know. Not for certain.
- Who are you talking to?

1049
01:10:53,716 --> 01:10:56,060
More than one. Four, possibly.

1050
01:10:59,722 --> 01:11:03,465
Okay, okay. I'll bring her to you
as soon as I can, Father Gallo.

1051
01:11:03,792 --> 01:11:04,896
Thank you.

1052
01:11:07,129 --> 01:11:10,474
Yeah, I know. It's David's fault.

1053
01:11:11,233 --> 01:11:15,409
The doctor asked me to talk to you, yes.
She's doing much better, your friend.

1054
01:11:15,738 --> 01:11:17,877
She's stable and she's resting,
so I suggest you go.

1055
01:11:17,940 --> 01:11:19,317
When can we see her?

1056
01:11:19,575 --> 01:11:21,987
She's gonna be here overnight,
so you can see her tomorrow.

1057
01:11:22,044 --> 01:11:23,250
Overnight? That's not possible.

1058
01:11:23,312 --> 01:11:24,655
Why is that?

1059
01:11:24,847 --> 01:11:27,919
There's something wrong with her.
It's not safe here.

1060
01:11:28,484 --> 01:11:30,020
No, this is very safe, I assure you.

1061
01:11:30,085 --> 01:11:31,120
Something's wrong with her.

1062
01:11:31,186 --> 01:11:32,756
We need to get her
out of here right now.

1063
01:11:32,821 --> 01:11:33,925
No, gentlemen, we are extremely...

1064
01:11:33,989 --> 01:11:37,163
Do you know
who Father Robert Gallo is?

1065
01:11:37,259 --> 01:11:40,399
Father Gallo, yes, I know him,
but I don't understand...

1066
01:11:42,097 --> 01:11:43,269
Isabella?

1067
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:46,001
Isabella?

1068
01:11:54,843 --> 01:11:56,288
What do we do, Ben?

1069
01:11:58,681 --> 01:12:00,683
Isabella, listen to me!

1070
01:12:04,787 --> 01:12:06,824
We need to get her out of here now!

1071
01:12:17,466 --> 01:12:18,706
Michael!

1072
01:12:19,535 --> 01:12:22,209
I've got her now!

1073
01:12:23,138 --> 01:12:25,049
We need to get her under control!

1074
01:12:26,675 --> 01:12:29,349
Help me, please!

1075
01:12:30,145 --> 01:12:33,718
I know this woman.
She needs to be sedated. Do it, now!

1076
01:12:34,550 --> 01:12:38,555
Jesus will bring your plans to nothing.
Christ will have none of your plans.

1077
01:12:39,655 --> 01:12:41,498
Let's take this outside.

1078
01:12:42,391 --> 01:12:44,064
Michael, put the camera down!

1079
01:12:48,731 --> 01:12:52,338
Listen to me. I'm a priest.
Please, go and help those people.

1080
01:12:52,401 --> 01:12:54,574
- Keep her here.
- Thank you, Father.

1081
01:12:55,738 --> 01:12:58,412
Okay, let's go, let's go, let's go.

1082
01:13:01,243 --> 01:13:02,881
- Come on.
- She just killed that woman.

1083
01:13:03,245 --> 01:13:04,952
We need to end this.

1084
01:13:05,681 --> 01:13:09,356
Grab her legs. Help me grab her legs!
We're going to Father Gallo's.

1085
01:13:09,585 --> 01:13:10,757
What's he going to do?

1086
01:13:10,919 --> 01:13:13,525
I need help with the exorcism.

1087
01:13:14,590 --> 01:13:16,433
Get the door. Get the door.

1088
01:13:16,859 --> 01:13:18,031
Oh, my God. What have I done?

1089
01:13:18,193 --> 01:13:19,763
You really think Gallo's going to help?

1090
01:13:20,028 --> 01:13:21,439
Yeah, I need help.

1091
01:13:22,030 --> 01:13:23,600
I need to fix this.

1092
01:13:24,266 --> 01:13:26,212
Oh, shit. Oh, shit. She's waking up.

1093
01:13:26,535 --> 01:13:28,037
She's waking up.

1094
01:13:28,604 --> 01:13:31,278
We haven't got much time, Michael.
We haven't got much time.

1095
01:13:31,607 --> 01:13:33,712
Stay with me. Don't let it get to you.

1096
01:13:34,943 --> 01:13:38,447
When I was 13,
my uncle told me he was an exorcist.

1097
01:13:39,448 --> 01:13:42,019
You can't get back
into God's good graces, priest.

1098
01:13:42,084 --> 01:13:43,722
Not after what you did.

1099
01:13:44,420 --> 01:13:45,455
Ben?

1100
01:13:45,721 --> 01:13:47,496
You wanted him to die, didn't you?

1101
01:13:47,990 --> 01:13:49,162
What is she doing?

1102
01:13:49,491 --> 01:13:51,801
He says to say, "Thank you."

1103
01:13:52,294 --> 01:13:53,796
Who are you?

1104
01:13:54,296 --> 01:13:57,300
You know me. Everyone knows me.

1105
01:13:57,633 --> 01:14:00,273
Lord, have mercy! Christ, have mercy!

1106
01:14:01,336 --> 01:14:02,474
God the Father!

1107
01:14:04,406 --> 01:14:05,407
Oh. My God!

1108
01:14:06,809 --> 01:14:07,844
Oh, shit!

1109
01:14:09,645 --> 01:14:12,023
Your place is in solitude!

1110
01:14:12,514 --> 01:14:15,188
Your abode is in the nest of serpents!

1111
01:14:15,250 --> 01:14:17,355
Be gone forthwith
from this servant of God!

1112
01:14:17,753 --> 01:14:20,233
Get out of her! Get out of her!

1113
01:14:28,030 --> 01:14:29,373
It's working, right?

1114
01:14:29,631 --> 01:14:31,633
I have got her under control,
but I don't know for how long.

1115
01:14:31,700 --> 01:14:33,077
You've got to hurry up.

1116
01:14:37,940 --> 01:14:38,941
It's okay.

1117
01:14:40,342 --> 01:14:43,186
It's going to be okay. I'm sorry.

1118
01:14:43,679 --> 01:14:45,283
Just be strong.

1119
01:14:45,848 --> 01:14:47,191
Be strong.

1120
01:14:48,684 --> 01:14:50,027
Just be strong.

1121
01:14:51,119 --> 01:14:52,189
Michael!
