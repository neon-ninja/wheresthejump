1
00:00:30,639 --> 00:00:35,197
The world is not made of atoms.

2
00:00:35,209 --> 00:00:39,027
It is made of stories.

3
00:04:14,384 --> 00:04:15,895
Aah!

4
00:04:24,046 --> 00:04:26,950
Hello, child.

5
00:04:30,052 --> 00:04:32,608
You've left your camera!

6
00:04:44,153 --> 00:04:46,752
Suck it, creep-o!

7
00:05:02,258 --> 00:05:04,944
Creep-o.

8
00:05:04,956 --> 00:05:06,859
That's a new one.

9
00:05:20,494 --> 00:05:24,703
What is life but a story?

10
00:05:24,715 --> 00:05:28,707
A single narrative thread
in the tapestry

11
00:05:28,719 --> 00:05:32,624
that binds us all.

12
00:05:32,636 --> 00:05:34,626
And as with all stories,

13
00:05:34,638 --> 00:05:39,065
it is not the length
of the tale that resonates,

14
00:05:39,077 --> 00:05:43,853
it is the quality
of the content within.

15
00:05:43,865 --> 00:05:47,770
I beseech you, friends,
that even as we mourn,

16
00:05:47,782 --> 00:05:54,603
let us celebrate as a tribute
to this young man's story.

17
00:05:54,615 --> 00:05:58,215
Let us seek solace that
we have been granted impunity

18
00:05:58,227 --> 00:06:00,217
from eternal rest.

19
00:06:00,229 --> 00:06:02,785
That death would not
eradicate us,

20
00:06:02,797 --> 00:06:07,137
but in the pages of life
we will continue forth

21
00:06:07,149 --> 00:06:11,010
and we cannot die!

22
00:06:20,162 --> 00:06:26,199
Uh, and now a reading
from Corinthians.

23
00:06:26,211 --> 00:06:28,637
Thank you for coming.

24
00:06:28,649 --> 00:06:32,423
Please drive safely.

25
00:06:32,435 --> 00:06:34,991
Sorry for your loss.

26
00:06:35,003 --> 00:06:37,167
Thank you for coming.

27
00:07:58,216 --> 00:08:02,208
I wouldn't.

28
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:04,733
This world,
this business,

29
00:08:04,745 --> 00:08:09,401
it's not as neat and tidy
as one might expect.

30
00:08:14,189 --> 00:08:17,485
The coffin...
It's so small.

31
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:20,096
A tragic thing,
indeed.

32
00:08:20,108 --> 00:08:24,274
Montgomery Dark,
resident mortician,

33
00:08:24,286 --> 00:08:26,711
indentured servant
to the great beyond.

34
00:08:26,723 --> 00:08:28,844
Dark. Really?

35
00:08:28,856 --> 00:08:30,106
Mm.

36
00:08:30,118 --> 00:08:34,197
It's a family name.

37
00:08:34,209 --> 00:08:37,417
Oh, I'm Sam.

38
00:08:37,429 --> 00:08:39,332
Sam.

39
00:08:39,344 --> 00:08:41,117
My condolences.

40
00:08:41,129 --> 00:08:43,293
Were you close with the child?

41
00:08:43,305 --> 00:08:47,993
Oh, no. I'm sorry.
I saw a sign out front.

42
00:08:48,005 --> 00:08:50,256
Sign?

43
00:08:50,268 --> 00:08:53,608
Yeah, "Help wanted."

44
00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:57,089
Are you still looking?

45
00:08:57,101 --> 00:08:59,178
Yes.

46
00:08:59,190 --> 00:09:04,662
Always.

47
00:09:04,674 --> 00:09:06,838
Please.

48
00:09:15,642 --> 00:09:19,808
Have you any experience
in the mortuary arts?

49
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:22,811
No, but I'm a fast learner.

50
00:09:22,823 --> 00:09:26,858
Mm, most people would
find it unmanageable.

51
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:29,469
Huh.
I'm not most people.

52
00:09:29,481 --> 00:09:31,341
We shall see.

53
00:09:31,353 --> 00:09:34,823
Please have a seat.

54
00:09:34,835 --> 00:09:38,043
This is... This is
one serious collection of books

55
00:09:38,055 --> 00:09:39,349
you've got here.

56
00:09:39,361 --> 00:09:40,872
The mere tip of the looming,

57
00:09:40,884 --> 00:09:44,049
lumbering iceberg,
I'm afraid...

58
00:09:44,061 --> 00:09:46,791
An archive of the various ways
in which clients

59
00:09:46,803 --> 00:09:51,361
have found themselves passing
through our hallowed halls.

60
00:09:51,373 --> 00:09:55,147
So, these are all stories
about how people died?

61
00:09:55,159 --> 00:10:00,457
Not just how,
my dear, why.

62
00:10:00,469 --> 00:10:03,329
Huh.
That's pretty cool.

63
00:10:03,341 --> 00:10:06,245
Yes, it is, isn't it?

64
00:10:17,834 --> 00:10:19,868
Tell me one.

65
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:24,481
Tell you one what? A story.

66
00:10:24,493 --> 00:10:27,919
Something...
dark and twisted.

67
00:10:27,931 --> 00:10:30,574
Something awesome.

68
00:10:30,586 --> 00:10:34,230
Mm. Perhaps we should
stick to business.

69
00:10:34,242 --> 00:10:35,840
We have much to do.

70
00:10:35,852 --> 00:10:37,363
Oh, come on, Monty.
If I'm going to be working here,

71
00:10:37,375 --> 00:10:39,061
I need to know what
I'm getting myself into.

72
00:10:39,073 --> 00:10:42,642
You are not hired yet,
young lady.

73
00:10:44,948 --> 00:10:47,112
Right because you have
a stack of applications

74
00:10:47,124 --> 00:10:48,636
to go through.

75
00:10:58,179 --> 00:11:04,390
Something dark,
twisted, and "awesome," eh?

76
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:10,309
Well, see how
this one grabs you.

77
00:11:30,037 --> 00:11:33,028
Uh, someone's in here.

78
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:35,595
Hoping you're
not trying to hide from me.

79
00:11:35,607 --> 00:11:37,467
I wouldn't dream of it.

80
00:11:37,479 --> 00:11:38,816
Okay.

81
00:11:38,828 --> 00:11:42,777
Meet me on the veranda in 10?

82
00:11:42,789 --> 00:11:45,431
Look, I've just got to say that
talking with you back there,

83
00:11:45,443 --> 00:11:48,565
I felt this connection, and
I feel like you felt it, too.

84
00:11:48,577 --> 00:11:50,219
A-Am I being crazy?

85
00:11:50,231 --> 00:11:54,658
I'm being crazy.
I'll see you on the veranda.

86
00:12:33,230 --> 00:12:35,189
Ahh.

87
00:13:18,362 --> 00:13:20,831
Okay.

88
00:13:52,657 --> 00:13:53,995
Okay.

89
00:13:54,007 --> 00:13:56,345
Ahh!

90
00:13:56,357 --> 00:13:58,838
Damn it.

91
00:14:32,349 --> 00:14:34,470
Aaaah!

92
00:14:56,983 --> 00:15:01,192
Can somebody help me?

93
00:15:01,204 --> 00:15:03,368
Help me, please!

94
00:16:07,053 --> 00:16:10,958
Aaaaah!

95
00:16:41,391 --> 00:16:43,437
It's not bad.

96
00:16:45,787 --> 00:16:49,170
I was expecting something
a bit more substantial.

97
00:16:49,182 --> 00:16:52,912
Maybe an ironic comeuppance
or a big twist, but...

98
00:16:52,924 --> 00:16:54,883
it was fun.

99
00:16:56,580 --> 00:16:59,354
Fun?

100
00:16:59,366 --> 00:17:01,225
Well, I have more stories.

101
00:17:01,237 --> 00:17:03,662
Many, many more.

102
00:17:03,674 --> 00:17:07,405
I was...
just warming up.

103
00:17:07,417 --> 00:17:09,886
Here.

104
00:17:09,898 --> 00:17:13,162
Sign here,
initial here and here.

105
00:17:15,382 --> 00:17:18,590
It's a bit far-fetched,
don't you think,

106
00:17:18,602 --> 00:17:20,505
an octopus
in a medicine cabinet?

107
00:17:20,517 --> 00:17:22,725
It was not an octopus.

108
00:17:22,737 --> 00:17:24,379
And.

109
00:17:24,391 --> 00:17:26,250
It is not the validity
of the story

110
00:17:26,262 --> 00:17:29,471
that concerns me,
but the message within.

111
00:17:29,483 --> 00:17:31,777
And the message is...

112
00:17:31,789 --> 00:17:34,780
don't stick you nose
where it doesn't belong?

113
00:17:34,792 --> 00:17:38,871
In a most basic sense, yes.

114
00:17:38,883 --> 00:17:42,092
But on a deeper level,

115
00:17:42,104 --> 00:17:47,358
it is about the universal
balance of all things.

116
00:17:49,372 --> 00:17:52,102
Universal balance?

117
00:17:57,119 --> 00:18:00,850
There we are...
Nice and neat.

118
00:18:00,862 --> 00:18:02,808
Shall we begin?

119
00:18:10,959 --> 00:18:15,691
The foyer, French for
where the fire is kept.

120
00:18:15,703 --> 00:18:18,563
Oh, who are these ghouls?

121
00:18:18,575 --> 00:18:21,523
Ghouls?

122
00:18:21,535 --> 00:18:23,916
These are morticians,
my dear,

123
00:18:23,928 --> 00:18:27,485
some of whom were called
to serve in this very house.

124
00:18:27,497 --> 00:18:31,141
A distinguished group,
to be sure.

125
00:18:31,153 --> 00:18:35,145
Yeah, distinguished.

126
00:18:35,157 --> 00:18:38,714
Come.
There's much to see.

127
00:18:44,384 --> 00:18:48,506
Of course, you've already seen
the viewing parlor.

128
00:18:48,518 --> 00:18:51,161
Very elementary.

129
00:18:51,173 --> 00:18:53,511
The mourning sit here

130
00:18:53,523 --> 00:18:58,516
and up here
resides the rhapsodist.

131
00:18:58,528 --> 00:19:00,910
How old are you?

132
00:19:00,922 --> 00:19:04,566
Ironic, is it not,
that one so old would preside

133
00:19:04,578 --> 00:19:08,657
over the passing
of one so young.

134
00:19:08,669 --> 00:19:11,660
So, what is the story here?

135
00:19:16,111 --> 00:19:18,623
I would rather not.

136
00:19:18,635 --> 00:19:22,944
Some tales even I find
too unsettling to recount.

137
00:19:24,250 --> 00:19:27,328
Tell me another one, then.

138
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:30,244
You say you have better stories.

139
00:19:30,256 --> 00:19:31,941
I want to hear them.

140
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:42,821
You've heard the phrase,
"better safe than sorry,"

141
00:19:42,833 --> 00:19:44,780
I presume?

142
00:19:44,792 --> 00:19:48,784
Well, this young man
had to learn it the hard way.

143
00:19:51,842 --> 00:19:54,920
Karl Marx said that
social progress can be measured

144
00:19:54,932 --> 00:19:58,010
by the social position
of the female sex.

145
00:19:58,022 --> 00:20:01,057
Now, ladies,
as a straight, white male,

146
00:20:01,069 --> 00:20:04,365
I'm going to be the first
to admit the tides are turning.

147
00:20:04,377 --> 00:20:06,845
The patriarchy is falling,
and in its place

148
00:20:06,857 --> 00:20:10,327
is a brave, new world
of equality and sexual freedom.

149
00:20:10,339 --> 00:20:13,722
A world where both men and women
are entitled to have sex

150
00:20:13,734 --> 00:20:16,246
whenever and with
whoever they please

151
00:20:16,258 --> 00:20:24,258
as long as they do so safely
and with the proper protection.

152
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:28,302
Just... like... that.

153
00:20:30,620 --> 00:20:33,307
You're empowered.

154
00:20:33,319 --> 00:20:36,223
Please, have some condoms.

155
00:20:36,235 --> 00:20:38,703
Guys, listen...
We are having a party tonight

156
00:20:38,715 --> 00:20:43,099
at the Sig Delt house.
You should stop by.

157
00:20:43,111 --> 00:20:46,711
Okay?

158
00:20:46,723 --> 00:20:50,454
So... is that true
about the patriarchy?

159
00:20:50,466 --> 00:20:54,806
No, idiot.
Patriarchy is solid.

160
00:20:54,818 --> 00:20:56,199
Karl Marx said that...

161
00:20:56,211 --> 00:20:58,332
You don't even know
who Karl Marx is.

162
00:20:58,344 --> 00:21:00,116
Yeah.
Yeah, I do.

163
00:21:00,128 --> 00:21:02,031
Yes, I do.

164
00:21:02,043 --> 00:21:04,599
Jakey, can you please tell me
what we're doing here?

165
00:21:04,611 --> 00:21:08,472
We are providing an important
service to the incoming freshmen

166
00:21:08,484 --> 00:21:12,868
who are young, impressionable,
and vulnerable.

167
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:17,176
Guys, it is our job to help them
make informed decisions.

168
00:21:19,582 --> 00:21:22,225
And that decision is to have sex

169
00:21:22,237 --> 00:21:24,445
with you hopeless jerks
at the party tonight.

170
00:21:24,457 --> 00:21:28,971
A-And what, the girls
who take the condoms

171
00:21:28,983 --> 00:21:31,713
are the ones who want to party.

172
00:21:31,725 --> 00:21:32,541
Oh!

173
00:21:32,553 --> 00:21:36,065
And party means sex.

174
00:21:36,077 --> 00:21:38,241
Anyone want condoms?!

175
00:21:38,253 --> 00:21:40,635
Condoms suck.

176
00:22:06,542 --> 00:22:08,140
Uh, hey!
Miss!

177
00:22:08,152 --> 00:22:09,577
Hey, excuse me,
Miss!

178
00:22:09,589 --> 00:22:11,318
Oh, Miss.
Hey! Can I...

179
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:13,755
Hey, I was just wondering

180
00:22:13,767 --> 00:22:16,584
if I can offer you
a, uh, prophylactic?

181
00:22:16,596 --> 00:22:17,759
I'm sorry?

182
00:22:17,771 --> 00:22:20,196
Um, uh,
it's slang for a condom.

183
00:22:20,208 --> 00:22:23,634
We're giving them away to show
how the patriarchy is dying.

184
00:22:23,646 --> 00:22:26,681
You know,
it's almost dead.

185
00:22:26,693 --> 00:22:29,727
I mean,
we're white guys and...

186
00:22:29,739 --> 00:22:31,468
Do you know who Karl Marx is

187
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:33,514
'cause he would want you
to have one?

188
00:22:33,526 --> 00:22:35,037
Uh, thanks.

189
00:22:35,049 --> 00:22:36,647
No problem.

190
00:22:36,659 --> 00:22:37,996
Uh, just one
'cause we've got plenty,

191
00:22:38,008 --> 00:22:39,650
and they're all free. Hey, buddy.

192
00:22:39,662 --> 00:22:41,435
Hi.
Hi.

193
00:22:41,447 --> 00:22:44,568
So, um, the girls lacrosse team
just showed up at the booth,

194
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:47,528
and, um...
we're out of bananas.

195
00:22:47,540 --> 00:22:49,225
Wha... Like,
the lacrosse team?

196
00:22:49,237 --> 00:22:50,792
The girls lacrosse team.

197
00:22:50,804 --> 00:22:53,795
That's like the fastest sport
on two feet.

198
00:22:53,807 --> 00:22:57,407
You got this?

199
00:22:57,419 --> 00:22:59,366
Yeah. Yeah,
I'll do my best.

200
00:22:59,378 --> 00:23:01,031
Okay.
Okay.

201
00:23:04,905 --> 00:23:08,026
Uh, yeah, we don't have
a girls lacrosse team.

202
00:23:08,038 --> 00:23:10,377
I'm Jake.
Uh, Sandra.

203
00:23:10,389 --> 00:23:13,380
You don't look like a freshman.

204
00:23:13,392 --> 00:23:15,120
No. It's 'cause
I'm not.

205
00:23:15,132 --> 00:23:17,688
I just come to these things
to get laid.

206
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:20,299
Oh, me too.

207
00:23:20,311 --> 00:23:22,867
What?
I w...

208
00:23:22,879 --> 00:23:25,522
I was...
I-I'm joking.

209
00:23:25,534 --> 00:23:28,525
I-I'm working at
the stay safe booth over there.

210
00:23:28,537 --> 00:23:31,746
I-I'm just trying to give back.

211
00:23:31,758 --> 00:23:32,790
I don't know.
I'm just doing my part.

212
00:23:32,802 --> 00:23:36,011
I like that.

213
00:23:36,023 --> 00:23:37,708
Hey, uh, Jake!

214
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:39,710
Could I just borrow you
for one second?

215
00:23:39,722 --> 00:23:42,974
Yeah.

216
00:23:42,986 --> 00:23:45,455
I'm so sorry.

217
00:23:45,467 --> 00:23:48,719
I got to go, but,
um, yeah.

218
00:23:48,731 --> 00:23:50,994
It was a... It was a pleasure
meeting you, Sandra.

219
00:23:56,217 --> 00:23:58,294
You know, um...
there's a party tonight

220
00:23:58,306 --> 00:23:59,991
at the Sig Delt house.

221
00:24:00,003 --> 00:24:01,558
We're throwing it.

222
00:24:01,570 --> 00:24:05,040
Uh, it's probably going to be
fun, so you should come.

223
00:24:05,052 --> 00:24:08,043
Yeah. Maybe.

224
00:24:08,055 --> 00:24:10,741
Maybe?

225
00:24:10,753 --> 00:24:13,265
Yeah, maybe is, uh...
Maybe's great.

226
00:24:13,277 --> 00:24:16,977
Okay, well, uh, maybe
I'll see you there.

227
00:24:50,271 --> 00:24:52,566
Uh, hang on!

228
00:24:55,015 --> 00:24:57,048
Yep!

229
00:24:57,060 --> 00:24:59,224
Yeah!

230
00:24:59,236 --> 00:25:01,052
Did you want
some liquid courage?

231
00:25:01,064 --> 00:25:02,489
Hmm? No.

232
00:25:02,501 --> 00:25:05,883
Okay. Uh, bottoms up!

233
00:25:10,944 --> 00:25:12,977
Something wrong? You've kind of
been acting a little weird

234
00:25:12,989 --> 00:25:14,762
ever since this morning?

235
00:25:14,774 --> 00:25:18,766
No, I'm fine. I'm just, uh...
yeah, I'm just laying low.

236
00:25:18,778 --> 00:25:20,550
Oh, yeah, that's cool.

237
00:25:20,562 --> 00:25:22,247
I'm laying low, too.

238
00:25:22,259 --> 00:25:24,380
You know, just laying real low
'cause I'm cool.

239
00:25:24,392 --> 00:25:26,121
We're cool.

240
00:25:26,133 --> 00:25:27,775
Oh, is that girl coming?

241
00:25:27,787 --> 00:25:29,646
What?

242
00:25:29,658 --> 00:25:31,430
The girl from this morning.

243
00:25:31,442 --> 00:25:33,781
I don't know, maybe.

244
00:25:33,793 --> 00:25:37,306
Cool. Maybe, who cares?
Whatever. You know.

245
00:25:37,318 --> 00:25:39,177
Whoa!
Hey, what is that?

246
00:25:39,189 --> 00:25:40,744
No! No! No!
Wait! Wait! Wait! Wait!

247
00:25:40,756 --> 00:25:43,312
Oh, you dog!

248
00:25:43,324 --> 00:25:45,227
What?
Jenny Si...

249
00:25:45,239 --> 00:25:48,360
Jenny Simon, the head
of the history department?!

250
00:25:48,372 --> 00:25:52,451
Yeah, I had to brush up
on the cultural relevance

251
00:25:52,463 --> 00:25:54,323
of Mesopotamia
in the 21st century.

252
00:25:54,335 --> 00:25:56,107
How do you do it?

253
00:25:56,119 --> 00:25:57,979
I mean, you look good.
That's a given.

254
00:25:57,991 --> 00:25:59,546
There's something else.
It's...

255
00:25:59,558 --> 00:26:04,333
Carter, girls aren't
some complex puzzle

256
00:26:04,345 --> 00:26:05,595
that need to be solved.

257
00:26:05,607 --> 00:26:07,075
They're the same as you and me.

258
00:26:07,087 --> 00:26:08,511
They want the same things.

259
00:26:08,523 --> 00:26:14,517
They... They want sex and...
And a companion.

260
00:26:14,529 --> 00:26:16,301
I mean, like everybody,

261
00:26:16,313 --> 00:26:20,175
they just... want to feel
like they're worth it.

262
00:26:22,581 --> 00:26:26,137
Look, if you can give
a girl that,

263
00:26:26,149 --> 00:26:29,097
even if it's just
for one night...

264
00:26:29,109 --> 00:26:33,710
you can have any girl
that you want.

265
00:26:33,722 --> 00:26:36,234
Look alive,
Sig Delts!

266
00:26:36,246 --> 00:26:40,630
I am a robot,
and this is my fuel.

267
00:26:40,642 --> 00:26:43,502
Aah!
Let's do it!

268
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:51,718
Hey, haven't you heard
about all of those missing guys?

269
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:53,154
What guys are you talking about?

270
00:28:53,166 --> 00:28:55,722
Yeah, there's fliers
all over campus.

271
00:28:55,734 --> 00:28:58,115
Oh, yeah. Yeah, those guys,
that's terribly sad.

272
00:28:58,127 --> 00:28:59,508
It's heartbreaking.

273
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:01,902
Aren't you worried
about your safety?

274
00:29:01,914 --> 00:29:04,600
I mean,
you barely know me.

275
00:29:04,612 --> 00:29:08,386
I could be...
a serial killer.

276
00:29:12,402 --> 00:29:15,089
Are you?

277
00:30:06,761 --> 00:30:09,360
I have something for you.

278
00:30:09,372 --> 00:30:12,581
Oh, yeah?
What is it?

279
00:30:26,781 --> 00:30:31,034
Oh, great.
That's...

280
00:30:31,046 --> 00:30:37,171
Yeah, you know, uh, I don't need
one of these, right?

281
00:30:37,183 --> 00:30:42,132
Yeah but I want to be empowered.

282
00:30:42,144 --> 00:30:45,353
Yeah.

283
00:30:45,365 --> 00:30:48,835
Absolutely.
Empowered.

284
00:30:48,847 --> 00:30:53,317
Just placing it over and...

285
00:30:53,329 --> 00:30:55,972
Okay.

286
00:31:05,124 --> 00:31:07,418
Turn over.

287
00:31:07,430 --> 00:31:10,160
What? Turn over!

288
00:32:48,879 --> 00:32:50,957
Hey, good morning!

289
00:32:50,969 --> 00:32:52,480
How did it go last night?

290
00:32:52,492 --> 00:32:53,395
As expected.

291
00:32:53,407 --> 00:32:55,657
Oh, yeah!

292
00:32:55,669 --> 00:32:59,226
Yeah, so, that's like,
number 67, right?

293
00:32:59,238 --> 00:33:02,403
It's really weird
that you know that.

294
00:33:02,415 --> 00:33:07,712
Hey, uh, did you... did you
forget to wear a condom?

295
00:33:07,724 --> 00:33:10,106
You know, maybe, uh,
maybe she had

296
00:33:10,118 --> 00:33:11,542
poison ivy or something.

297
00:33:13,382 --> 00:33:16,156
It's probably
just from friction.

298
00:33:16,168 --> 00:33:18,071
Mm, well, either way,

299
00:33:18,083 --> 00:33:19,724
you probably should
get that checked out.

300
00:33:19,736 --> 00:33:21,248
Uh, it's fine.

301
00:33:21,260 --> 00:33:22,771
Okay.
Okay.

302
00:33:22,783 --> 00:33:24,338
You know better than me.

303
00:33:24,350 --> 00:33:26,035
Yes I do.
Yeah, you do.

304
00:33:26,047 --> 00:33:30,779
Okay. I'll see you later
'cause I got some things to do.

305
00:33:42,455 --> 00:33:44,401
Son of a bitch.

306
00:34:00,081 --> 00:34:03,942
So, you got a case
of the cooties, did ya?

307
00:34:03,954 --> 00:34:07,424
Um, c-come here.

308
00:34:07,436 --> 00:34:10,558
You know,
I think it's one of...

309
00:34:10,570 --> 00:34:14,301
Mm. You think
it's this one? Yeah.

310
00:34:14,313 --> 00:34:16,520
Well, if it's this one...

311
00:34:16,532 --> 00:34:19,480
we're gonna have to amputate.

312
00:34:19,492 --> 00:34:22,309
W-What?

313
00:34:22,321 --> 00:34:25,051
I'm just screwing with you, kid.

314
00:34:25,063 --> 00:34:28,141
They won't let me near a scalpel
and... for good reason.

315
00:34:28,153 --> 00:34:30,186
No, I'm sure it's nothing

316
00:34:30,198 --> 00:34:34,147
a good ol' fashioned dose
of penicillin won't clear up.

317
00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:36,366
Let's just take a look
at your labs here.

318
00:34:36,378 --> 00:34:38,064
Okay.

319
00:34:40,426 --> 00:34:43,417
Wait a second.

320
00:34:43,429 --> 00:34:45,027
What's wrong?

321
00:34:45,039 --> 00:34:47,769
Must be... Ah, this must be
some sort of a mix up.

322
00:34:47,781 --> 00:34:49,510
Just lay down on this table
for me, will ya?

323
00:34:49,522 --> 00:34:50,946
What do you mean a mix up?

324
00:34:50,958 --> 00:34:52,730
We'll get to that in a second.
Just lay down.

325
00:34:52,742 --> 00:34:54,689
I wanna... Something.

326
00:34:54,701 --> 00:34:56,995
Yeah, just relax.

327
00:34:57,007 --> 00:35:00,216
Take a deep breath in.

328
00:35:00,228 --> 00:35:01,870
Good, again.

329
00:35:15,591 --> 00:35:17,277
What the hell?

330
00:35:17,289 --> 00:35:19,714
What? What?
What's wrong?

331
00:35:19,726 --> 00:35:22,195
Wha... Wha...

332
00:35:22,207 --> 00:35:25,546
Um... no,
everything's... fine.

333
00:35:25,558 --> 00:35:28,636
I'm just gonna... go check
on something really quick.

334
00:35:28,648 --> 00:35:31,247
You just stay put.

335
00:35:31,259 --> 00:35:32,770
I'll be right back.

336
00:35:32,782 --> 00:35:34,337
No. No. No. No.I'll be right back!

337
00:35:34,349 --> 00:35:36,383
What do... What do you
have to go check on?

338
00:36:58,912 --> 00:37:01,468
523...

339
00:37:05,875 --> 00:37:08,431
This is Telecom Industries.
Can I help you?

340
00:37:08,443 --> 00:37:10,564
Hello?

341
00:37:18,715 --> 00:37:21,749
No!

342
00:37:25,504 --> 00:37:27,145
Please. Please. Please. Please.
Please. Please.

343
00:37:27,157 --> 00:37:29,974
Hello? Hi, Sandra?

344
00:37:29,986 --> 00:37:32,499
Yeah? It's Jake. What's up?

345
00:37:32,511 --> 00:37:35,197
Jake?

346
00:37:35,209 --> 00:37:38,809
Yeah, from, uh... from the party
last night, remember?

347
00:37:38,821 --> 00:37:42,030
We, um... We hung out.

348
00:37:42,042 --> 00:37:44,815
Oh, hey. What's up?

349
00:37:44,827 --> 00:37:46,469
Not much.
Not much at all.

350
00:37:46,481 --> 00:37:49,167
I just, um... I've got
the afternoon...

351
00:37:49,179 --> 00:37:51,039
...off,

352
00:37:51,051 --> 00:37:54,085
and I was wondering if maybe
you wanted to hang out?

353
00:37:54,097 --> 00:37:55,435
Yeah, okay.

354
00:37:55,447 --> 00:37:58,046
Okay. Okay, yeah.
Yeah, that's great.

355
00:37:58,058 --> 00:38:02,833
Um... what's
your address?

356
00:38:17,686 --> 00:38:22,288
No. No. No. No.

357
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:24,202
Welcome, brother.

358
00:38:27,217 --> 00:38:30,687
It was our forefather,
Ezekiel Durkas, who wrote...

359
00:38:30,699 --> 00:38:32,515
Durkas wrote.

360
00:38:32,527 --> 00:38:36,737
That a man can measure his worth
by the notches on his bedpost.

361
00:38:36,749 --> 00:38:40,262
Each groove represents
not only a conquest for himself,

362
00:38:40,274 --> 00:38:43,047
but for the brotherhood
as a whole.

363
00:38:43,059 --> 00:38:45,572
The honor is ours to share.

364
00:38:45,584 --> 00:38:48,314
It was recently
brought to my attention

365
00:38:48,326 --> 00:38:51,578
that Jake of the family Matthews

366
00:38:51,590 --> 00:38:55,364
has reached
the sacred number 67.

367
00:38:55,376 --> 00:38:57,323
No. No. No.
Put it back.

368
00:38:57,335 --> 00:39:00,456
A holy number which represents
the 67 founders

369
00:39:00,468 --> 00:39:02,676
of our great fraternity

370
00:39:02,688 --> 00:39:04,591
and is honored
with the 67 cherry trees

371
00:39:04,603 --> 00:39:06,941
spread across this great land.

372
00:39:06,953 --> 00:39:14,252
67 cherries for Sig Delt and
67 cherries for Brother Matthew.

373
00:39:14,264 --> 00:39:16,037
You got to sit down. I don't want to sit!

374
00:39:16,049 --> 00:39:18,256
It's tradition!
Come on.

375
00:39:18,268 --> 00:39:21,042
You, sir, are bronze.

376
00:39:21,054 --> 00:39:24,654
Come on.
Give me your keys.

377
00:39:24,666 --> 00:39:29,093
I am so proud of you, man.

378
00:39:29,105 --> 00:39:33,054
Brother Matthews,
as is your right,

379
00:39:33,066 --> 00:39:36,492
you may now hang your name
on the sacred mantel.

380
00:39:36,504 --> 00:39:39,147
Great.
Thank you, Todd.

381
00:39:45,992 --> 00:39:47,982
No. No. No.

382
00:39:51,911 --> 00:39:54,423
No. No. No. No.

383
00:39:59,179 --> 00:40:01,474
We're gonna need more.

384
00:40:30,428 --> 00:40:32,853
Aah!

385
00:40:52,972 --> 00:40:56,703
Keys.
Give me the keys.

386
00:41:20,303 --> 00:41:24,078
Hey!
Can I help you?

387
00:41:24,090 --> 00:41:28,909
Uh, I-I'm looking for Sandra.

388
00:41:42,456 --> 00:41:46,187
Sandra Patricia Marie,
get downstairs now!

389
00:41:52,945 --> 00:41:56,284
Oh, God!

390
00:41:56,296 --> 00:41:57,633
God! God! God!

391
00:41:57,645 --> 00:41:58,895
Oh! Oh, God!

392
00:41:58,907 --> 00:42:02,464
Okay.
It's perfectly natural.

393
00:42:02,476 --> 00:42:04,814
Natural?

394
00:42:04,826 --> 00:42:07,730
Are you kidding me?

395
00:42:07,742 --> 00:42:11,604
In what world is this natural?!

396
00:42:15,576 --> 00:42:17,697
You!

397
00:42:17,709 --> 00:42:18,959
What did you do to me?!

398
00:42:18,971 --> 00:42:20,961
What did I do to you?

399
00:42:20,973 --> 00:42:23,398
I thought you wore protection.

400
00:42:23,410 --> 00:42:26,270
Um... I...

401
00:42:30,330 --> 00:42:32,233
I-I did...
I didn't.

402
00:42:32,245 --> 00:42:35,758
I'm sorry.

403
00:42:35,770 --> 00:42:38,239
You got...
You got to understand.

404
00:42:38,251 --> 00:42:40,807
I-I used to be fat.

405
00:42:40,819 --> 00:42:44,680
Like, I was like,
really, really fat.

406
00:42:44,692 --> 00:42:46,247
Like, kids would pick on me.

407
00:42:46,259 --> 00:42:48,379
They... They'd throw stuff
at me, okay?

408
00:42:48,391 --> 00:42:51,165
Girls... Girls like you
wouldn't even look at me...

409
00:42:51,177 --> 00:42:52,949
until the day
that I made a decision

410
00:42:52,961 --> 00:42:55,169
that I was going
to change myself.

411
00:42:55,181 --> 00:42:57,345
And then things got better.

412
00:42:57,357 --> 00:43:01,001
Okay, they got better,
and I got worse.

413
00:43:01,013 --> 00:43:06,223
Look at me.
I'm hideous.

414
00:43:06,235 --> 00:43:09,662
I'm a monster.

415
00:43:09,674 --> 00:43:13,404
And I'm <i>fat</i> again!

416
00:43:21,947 --> 00:43:24,154
Sandra where are you going?

417
00:43:27,039 --> 00:43:29,116
Where are you...

418
00:43:29,128 --> 00:43:32,772
Hey. Looks like
I'm free after all.

419
00:43:35,830 --> 00:43:38,516
It's nearly there.
Big breath.

420
00:43:48,930 --> 00:43:51,007
I got a question for you.

421
00:43:51,019 --> 00:43:53,880
How is this going to work?
Where is it going to come out?

422
00:43:53,892 --> 00:43:57,144
Uh, well, uh...

423
00:43:57,156 --> 00:44:00,016
It's going to come out
the same it got in.

424
00:44:23,748 --> 00:44:25,651
You got a blanket?

425
00:45:18,933 --> 00:45:20,488
<i>That</i> was a story.

426
00:45:20,500 --> 00:45:22,708
Ah, you mean it? Absolutely.

427
00:45:24,199 --> 00:45:26,886
There was romance,
suspense,

428
00:45:26,898 --> 00:45:28,975
horror,
social commentary.

429
00:45:28,987 --> 00:45:30,454
I mean it was...

430
00:45:30,466 --> 00:45:33,501
It was everything
a story should be and more.

431
00:45:33,513 --> 00:45:37,026
Now you're being glib
aren't you?

432
00:45:37,038 --> 00:45:39,028
Only a little.

433
00:45:52,706 --> 00:45:55,175
Wait here.

434
00:46:00,061 --> 00:46:03,487
Don't touch anything.

435
00:46:45,019 --> 00:46:48,184
Impressive,
isn't it?

436
00:46:48,196 --> 00:46:50,056
Be careful.

437
00:46:50,068 --> 00:46:52,928
I wouldn't want you
to take a tumble.

438
00:46:55,813 --> 00:46:57,803
Shall we continue?

439
00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:11,611
This house was built with all
the modern conveniences...

440
00:47:17,573 --> 00:47:20,216
...of 1825.

441
00:47:28,149 --> 00:47:30,748
Coming?

442
00:47:30,760 --> 00:47:33,926
The embalming room.

443
00:47:33,938 --> 00:47:38,278
This is where the sausage
is made, so to speak.

444
00:47:38,290 --> 00:47:40,410
Hm.

445
00:47:40,422 --> 00:47:43,544
Every corpse tells a story.

446
00:47:43,556 --> 00:47:48,723
It is our task to listen
to uncover the clues

447
00:47:48,735 --> 00:47:51,160
and extract the truth.

448
00:47:51,172 --> 00:47:54,685
Looks like you're extracting
a little more than just truth.

449
00:47:54,697 --> 00:47:59,212
Care to give this one a try?

450
00:48:01,269 --> 00:48:04,217
Wow, she looks...
perfect.

451
00:48:04,229 --> 00:48:08,177
Look closer.
The devil is in the detail.

452
00:48:08,189 --> 00:48:12,747
Here.
See this mark?

453
00:48:12,759 --> 00:48:15,271
Ugh.

454
00:48:15,283 --> 00:48:19,797
The bed sore... very unusual
in one so young.

455
00:48:19,809 --> 00:48:23,105
And if we examine
the upper palate,

456
00:48:23,117 --> 00:48:26,195
we will find traces
of magnesium,

457
00:48:26,207 --> 00:48:28,894
an essential element
used to treat patients

458
00:48:28,906 --> 00:48:32,462
in perpetual catatonic states.

459
00:48:32,474 --> 00:48:36,597
Oh, and she was married.

460
00:48:36,609 --> 00:48:39,426
Indeed.

461
00:48:39,438 --> 00:48:40,439
Is there an inscription?

462
00:48:42,789 --> 00:48:46,172
"Till death do us part."

463
00:48:46,184 --> 00:48:50,698
Oh, how...
predictable.

464
00:48:50,710 --> 00:48:55,268
"Till death do us part."

465
00:48:55,280 --> 00:48:59,837
But what if even death
provides no reprieve?

466
00:49:27,051 --> 00:49:31,391
Do you, Carol Peters,
take Wendell Owens

467
00:49:31,403 --> 00:49:35,047
to be your husband
to have and to hold

468
00:49:35,059 --> 00:49:39,573
in sickness and in health,
till do you part?

469
00:49:39,585 --> 00:49:41,967
I do.

470
00:49:48,942 --> 00:49:51,193
And do you,
Wendell Owens,

471
00:49:51,205 --> 00:49:55,110
take Carol Peters
to be your wife

472
00:49:55,122 --> 00:50:00,246
to have and to hold
in sickness and in health

473
00:50:00,258 --> 00:50:05,686
till death do you part?

474
00:50:31,680 --> 00:50:33,030
Aaah!

475
00:50:49,742 --> 00:50:54,660
Hey. Hey.

476
00:51:51,630 --> 00:51:53,185
Yes?

477
00:51:53,197 --> 00:51:56,188
Hi. Uh, can you buzz me in?
I forgot my keys.

478
00:51:57,984 --> 00:52:00,540
Sorry, what? Huh?

479
00:52:00,552 --> 00:52:03,195
C-Can you... Can you buzz me
into the building?

480
00:52:03,207 --> 00:52:05,078
Thank you.

481
00:52:11,911 --> 00:52:14,423
Hey, old timer.

482
00:52:14,435 --> 00:52:17,078
Hey, Miss Avery,
how are you?

483
00:52:17,090 --> 00:52:20,125
Look at all that food.
Special occasion?

484
00:52:20,137 --> 00:52:22,475
Yeah, something like that.

485
00:52:22,487 --> 00:52:24,825
I'll get that for you. I love a good meal.

486
00:52:24,837 --> 00:52:26,653
My girlfriends and I
went on this

487
00:52:26,665 --> 00:52:30,178
all-inclusive cruise
last spring. Uh-huh?

488
00:52:30,190 --> 00:52:33,747
Have you ever been on one
of those all-inclusive cruises?

489
00:52:33,759 --> 00:52:37,272
No, I... I take care of Carol.

490
00:52:37,284 --> 00:52:38,926
Oh, you got to go.

491
00:52:38,938 --> 00:52:43,060
All the food you can eat,
and it's all free.

492
00:52:43,072 --> 00:52:45,411
That's the all-inclusive part.

493
00:52:47,425 --> 00:52:51,243
When Arthur was alive,
we never went anywhere,

494
00:52:51,255 --> 00:52:55,160
but now that he's gone,
I am seeing the world.

495
00:52:55,172 --> 00:52:58,032
That does sound nice. Are you coming?

496
00:52:58,044 --> 00:53:03,385
Uh, no, I don't like elevators,
especially this one.

497
00:53:03,397 --> 00:53:04,257
I'm going to take the stairs.

498
00:53:04,269 --> 00:53:06,562
12 stories at your age?

499
00:53:06,574 --> 00:53:08,738
How old do you think I am?

500
00:53:08,750 --> 00:53:11,698
I get it.
Got to stay in shape.

501
00:53:11,710 --> 00:53:13,700
I'm going to Cancun
this Christmas.

502
00:53:13,712 --> 00:53:16,746
Uh-huh. They have nude beaches.

503
00:53:16,758 --> 00:53:18,444
Neat.

504
00:53:18,456 --> 00:53:20,881
Yeah.
Tell Carol I said...

505
00:53:48,834 --> 00:53:52,391
<i>It's spring time in Raven's
End, and love is in the air.</i>

506
00:53:52,403 --> 00:53:54,610
<i>Stay tuned for
the local forecast</i>

507
00:53:54,622 --> 00:53:58,571
<i>where things are going
to get... foggy.</i>

508
00:54:25,653 --> 00:54:27,339
<i>It's summer.
The locals are wondering</i>

509
00:54:27,351 --> 00:54:29,036
<i>if they will ever see the sun.</i>

510
00:54:40,320 --> 00:54:42,832
<i>Bundle up, Raven's End.
Fall is in the air.</i>

511
00:54:55,814 --> 00:54:57,381
What was that?

512
00:55:02,386 --> 00:55:03,386
Carol?

513
00:55:09,131 --> 00:55:11,034
It's fine.

514
00:55:31,328 --> 00:55:35,450
So, you, uh, ever thing about
taking some of these walls out?

515
00:55:35,462 --> 00:55:39,019
Giving yourself
more of a open floor plan?

516
00:55:39,031 --> 00:55:41,151
How's she doing?

517
00:55:41,163 --> 00:55:45,068
Uh, she's...
She's doing well.

518
00:55:45,080 --> 00:55:47,767
She's... well?

519
00:55:47,779 --> 00:55:49,551
How can that be?

520
00:55:49,563 --> 00:55:51,161
Yeah, I know.
It's hard to believe.

521
00:55:51,173 --> 00:55:52,511
But you know her...
She's a fighter.

522
00:55:52,523 --> 00:55:54,426
Her vitals are solid.

523
00:55:54,438 --> 00:55:56,123
I'd keep an eye
on her bed sores...

524
00:55:56,135 --> 00:55:59,822
Sorry.
Uh, she's improving?

525
00:55:59,834 --> 00:56:01,998
No, that's not what I said.

526
00:56:02,010 --> 00:56:06,829
She's... stabilized.

527
00:56:06,841 --> 00:56:09,397
So how much time does she have?
What are we talking?

528
00:56:09,409 --> 00:56:12,966
Uh, it's...
It's kind of tough to say.

529
00:56:12,978 --> 00:56:16,448
Um, at this rate...

530
00:56:16,460 --> 00:56:21,278
another year,
possibly more.

531
00:56:21,290 --> 00:56:23,803
A year?

532
00:56:23,815 --> 00:56:25,848
Yeah.

533
00:56:25,860 --> 00:56:28,460
Possibly more.

534
00:56:30,387 --> 00:56:34,117
How am I supposed
to make this work?

535
00:56:37,350 --> 00:56:41,473
Al we have is... is bills
and bed pans

536
00:56:41,485 --> 00:56:45,085
and vacant,
empty stares.

537
00:56:47,447 --> 00:56:51,874
I just can't do this anymore.

538
00:56:53,497 --> 00:56:58,359
I might have something
that could help.

539
00:56:58,371 --> 00:57:02,624
It's a pain medication,
but it's... it's very strong.

540
00:57:02,636 --> 00:57:05,801
If Carol were to take
more than two of these

541
00:57:05,813 --> 00:57:09,283
in a 24-hour period,
the results could be disastrous.

542
00:57:09,295 --> 00:57:14,331
Great. I will
add it to the rest.

543
00:57:14,343 --> 00:57:16,812
You understand what
I'm telling you, Wendell?

544
00:57:16,824 --> 00:57:18,727
What?

545
00:57:18,739 --> 00:57:22,165
Those pills right there...
they don't leave a trace,

546
00:57:22,177 --> 00:57:23,819
so it would be impossible
for someone

547
00:57:23,831 --> 00:57:25,517
to determine
if she took too much.

548
00:57:25,529 --> 00:57:28,433
She would just drift off
to sleep, not wake up.

549
00:57:28,445 --> 00:57:31,697
Oh.
Yeah, "oh."

550
00:57:55,776 --> 00:57:58,375
You look really nice tonight.

551
00:58:01,695 --> 00:58:03,555
Mm.

552
00:58:06,613 --> 00:58:09,038
I got something for you.

553
00:58:09,050 --> 00:58:11,563
It's a surprise.

554
00:58:18,146 --> 00:58:20,876
Here.
I'll open it for you.

555
00:58:23,325 --> 00:58:26,795
That is an Arctic hare.

556
00:58:26,807 --> 00:58:30,146
It's pretty creepy, right?

557
00:58:30,158 --> 00:58:32,801
Sorry.

558
00:58:32,813 --> 00:58:35,587
I know they used
to cheer you up.

559
00:58:41,866 --> 00:58:46,685
Carol I need you to...
do something for me.

560
00:58:46,697 --> 00:58:49,731
'Cause I can't do
this alone anymore.

561
00:58:53,355 --> 00:58:56,172
Can you give me a sign
that you are there?

562
00:58:59,274 --> 00:59:01,526
Please?

563
00:59:10,416 --> 00:59:12,853
Do it right now.

564
00:59:16,596 --> 00:59:18,163
Right now.

565
00:59:21,862 --> 00:59:25,941
Now!

566
00:59:25,953 --> 00:59:28,857
I'm sorry.

567
01:00:05,819 --> 01:00:08,244
Here we go.

568
01:00:32,759 --> 01:00:37,534
That's it. You're all done.
You're all done.

569
01:01:02,180 --> 01:01:03,517
Carol?

570
01:01:11,580 --> 01:01:13,788
No! Oh, no!

571
01:01:16,803 --> 01:01:19,576
Carol come on!

572
01:01:19,588 --> 01:01:22,231
Get it up!
Come on!

573
01:01:27,684 --> 01:01:29,630
I'm so sorry.

574
01:01:40,261 --> 01:01:44,732
Oh, I'm sorry.
Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry.

575
01:01:44,744 --> 01:01:46,691
Honey?

576
01:01:50,141 --> 01:01:52,131
Aah!

577
01:02:20,649 --> 01:02:22,552
Kubler residence.

578
01:02:22,564 --> 01:02:27,340
She fell on an Arctic hare,
and, um, there's a lot of blood

579
01:02:27,352 --> 01:02:29,429
and, uh, I don't know
what to do.

580
01:02:29,441 --> 01:02:31,431
An Arctic hare?
What are you talking about?

581
01:02:31,443 --> 01:02:34,216
I gave her the pills,
alright?!

582
01:02:34,228 --> 01:02:35,870
And then she moved.

583
01:02:35,882 --> 01:02:38,046
And she grabbed my arm,
and I turned her over.

584
01:02:38,058 --> 01:02:40,832
She moved? Yes, she moved!

585
01:02:40,844 --> 01:02:43,008
Okay?!
Now she's dead.

586
01:02:43,020 --> 01:02:45,532
She's really, really dead,
and I don't know what to do!

587
01:02:45,544 --> 01:02:49,231
What do I do?!

588
01:02:49,243 --> 01:02:50,798
Help!

589
01:02:50,810 --> 01:02:52,844
You got to get that body
out of your apartment.

590
01:02:52,856 --> 01:02:55,672
Toss it in the ocean
and pray the sharks do the rest.

591
01:02:55,684 --> 01:02:58,371
What? Just do it!
Don't call back.

592
01:04:37,308 --> 01:04:39,428
Ugh.

593
01:05:22,788 --> 01:05:24,909
Aah!

594
01:07:16,423 --> 01:07:19,240
Hey, buddy,
hold the elevator for me.

595
01:07:19,252 --> 01:07:21,286
- Thank you a million.
- Yeah.

596
01:07:25,476 --> 01:07:27,118
Hey, I said, hold it!

597
01:07:27,130 --> 01:07:29,207
We don't want to wait
20 minutes for the next one!

598
01:07:29,219 --> 01:07:32,210
Hold the elevator! I'm sorry.

599
01:08:46,861 --> 01:08:48,286
Aah!

600
01:08:50,430 --> 01:08:52,420
Aah!

601
01:09:00,440 --> 01:09:02,213
Wendell?

602
01:09:05,358 --> 01:09:08,132
Wendell,
is that you?

603
01:09:08,144 --> 01:09:09,307
Hey, Mrs Avery.

604
01:09:09,319 --> 01:09:11,439
Well, is the elevator stuck?

605
01:09:11,451 --> 01:09:13,180
Looks that way, huh?

606
01:09:13,192 --> 01:09:16,357
Um... I wouldn't worry
about it, though.

607
01:09:16,369 --> 01:09:19,578
Well, I never heard it make
that sound before.

608
01:09:19,590 --> 01:09:22,624
Maybe I'd better
call the police. No!

609
01:09:22,636 --> 01:09:25,975
Uh, listen, I'm sure she'll come
back to life any second now.

610
01:09:25,987 --> 01:09:27,368
I'm fine.

611
01:09:27,380 --> 01:09:29,544
All the same,
I'm calling the police

612
01:09:29,556 --> 01:09:31,416
just in case.

613
01:09:31,428 --> 01:09:33,635
No, Mrs Avery. No,
you don't need to do that.

614
01:09:36,084 --> 01:09:38,597
Mrs Avery!

615
01:09:38,609 --> 01:09:41,817
Aah!

616
01:10:25,308 --> 01:10:26,949
Aah!

617
01:10:48,853 --> 01:10:52,932
I wish I'd never...

618
01:10:52,944 --> 01:10:54,760
Aah!

619
01:11:22,539 --> 01:11:24,137
Carol?

620
01:11:34,507 --> 01:11:36,932
Carol?

621
01:14:14,014 --> 01:14:22,014
In sickness and in health,
TILL DEATH DO US PART.WOMAN: Sir?

622
01:14:23,328 --> 01:14:27,799
Sir? In sickness and in health,
till death do us part.

623
01:14:27,811 --> 01:14:35,811
In sickness and in health,
till death do us part.

624
01:14:40,780 --> 01:14:42,509
I kind of hated that story.

625
01:14:42,521 --> 01:14:45,164
Oh.

626
01:14:45,176 --> 01:14:47,471
I mean, he did what anyone would
do in his situation,

627
01:14:47,483 --> 01:14:50,212
yet he was punished for it.

628
01:14:50,224 --> 01:14:53,433
We must each fulfill
our destiny, young lady.

629
01:14:53,445 --> 01:14:55,566
Who are we to question fate?

630
01:14:55,578 --> 01:14:57,785
Yeah, and what was
Wendell's fate?

631
01:14:57,797 --> 01:15:00,745
He went mad.

632
01:15:00,757 --> 01:15:03,617
He was committed
to the local asylum.

633
01:15:03,629 --> 01:15:07,839
Kirksdale?
Do you know it?

634
01:15:07,851 --> 01:15:10,189
Everyone knows Kirksdale.

635
01:15:10,201 --> 01:15:13,845
A vile and tragic place.

636
01:15:17,208 --> 01:15:20,416
What wood is this?

637
01:15:20,428 --> 01:15:26,248
Oh, you'd be surprised
what we find in people's colons.

638
01:15:26,260 --> 01:15:27,728
Oh.

639
01:15:27,740 --> 01:15:30,122
Ready for the best part?

640
01:15:30,134 --> 01:15:32,092
Yeah.

641
01:15:35,835 --> 01:15:38,739
When the house was built
at the turn of the century,

642
01:15:38,751 --> 01:15:40,915
there was no electricity.

643
01:15:40,927 --> 01:15:45,746
We had to think of creative ways
to keep the bodies cold.

644
01:15:45,758 --> 01:15:48,488
Hence,
the sub basement.

645
01:15:58,466 --> 01:16:00,761
Give me a hand,
will you?

646
01:16:03,602 --> 01:16:05,157
Gently.

647
01:16:05,169 --> 01:16:06,854
Don't take this the wrong way,

648
01:16:06,866 --> 01:16:12,164
but all of your stories...
are a little predictable.

649
01:16:12,176 --> 01:16:14,122
Predictable?

650
01:16:14,134 --> 01:16:17,169
Someone commits a sin,
they pay a horrible price.

651
01:16:17,181 --> 01:16:19,475
Rinse, repeat.

652
01:16:22,186 --> 01:16:26,961
The form may be familiar,
but the message is timeless.

653
01:16:26,973 --> 01:16:31,357
No evil deed goes unpunished.

654
01:16:31,369 --> 01:16:34,360
You don't really
believe that, do you?

655
01:16:34,372 --> 01:16:37,102
Completely.

656
01:16:42,815 --> 01:16:45,806
You're going to love
this next part.

657
01:17:02,400 --> 01:17:05,217
This is the heart of the house.

658
01:17:11,844 --> 01:17:15,053
This poor soul's journey
has come to an end.

659
01:17:15,065 --> 01:17:19,144
In dust we started,
to dust we return.

660
01:17:19,156 --> 01:17:21,146
Wait!

661
01:17:28,382 --> 01:17:31,025
I lied.

662
01:17:31,037 --> 01:17:34,202
I'm not here for the job.

663
01:17:34,214 --> 01:17:36,422
I'm here for him.

664
01:17:36,434 --> 01:17:40,644
You said no evil deed
goes unpunished...

665
01:17:40,656 --> 01:17:44,560
but you're wrong.

666
01:17:44,572 --> 01:17:49,653
In real life,
bad guys win all the time.

667
01:17:49,665 --> 01:17:51,742
Logan is proof.

668
01:17:56,846 --> 01:17:59,663
It's all my fault.

669
01:18:05,332 --> 01:18:08,454
Please, can I see him
one last time?

670
01:18:24,177 --> 01:18:26,385
I want to tell you his story.

671
01:18:35,798 --> 01:18:38,049
And with the handsome
knight by her side,

672
01:18:38,061 --> 01:18:40,442
the princess knew that she would
be safe...

673
01:18:40,454 --> 01:18:43,315
...forever and ever.

674
01:18:43,327 --> 01:18:46,971
I wish I had a knight
like that to keep me safe.

675
01:18:46,983 --> 01:18:50,061
You don't need a handsome
knight, you got me, you twerp.

676
01:18:51,814 --> 01:18:54,587
Now go to sleep or your parents
are going to kill me.

677
01:18:54,599 --> 01:18:57,372
Aw.

678
01:18:57,384 --> 01:18:59,418
Denver residence.

679
01:18:59,430 --> 01:19:02,160
- Hey, sexy.
- Hey, Bart.

680
01:19:02,172 --> 01:19:04,031
Want me to grab
some drinks on my way over?

681
01:19:04,043 --> 01:19:07,600
What part of "no guests allowed"
are you still grappling with?

682
01:19:07,612 --> 01:19:08,993
So, now I'm a guest, huh?

683
01:19:09,005 --> 01:19:10,951
Well,
no pervs allowed, either.

684
01:19:10,963 --> 01:19:12,866
I'm not a perv.

685
01:19:12,878 --> 01:19:14,781
I'm just worried
about you, is all...

686
01:19:14,793 --> 01:19:17,044
Home alone with that psycho
on the loose.

687
01:19:17,056 --> 01:19:18,916
Plus, I haven't seen
you in a week.

688
01:19:18,928 --> 01:19:20,787
I'm dying over here.

689
01:19:20,799 --> 01:19:24,225
Well, put an ice pack on it
because you're not coming over.

690
01:19:24,237 --> 01:19:26,271
Okay, I get it.

691
01:19:26,283 --> 01:19:28,012
Have fun babysitting.

692
01:20:14,635 --> 01:20:16,103
Aah!

693
01:20:16,115 --> 01:20:17,626
Mind if I join you?

694
01:20:17,638 --> 01:20:18,932
Bart, you creep!

695
01:20:18,944 --> 01:20:20,716
Well, I didn't see
that one coming.

696
01:20:35,482 --> 01:20:38,212
<i>Hi, Sam.</i>

697
01:20:38,224 --> 01:20:39,692
<i>It looks like we're going to be</i>

698
01:20:39,704 --> 01:20:41,302
<i>a little later than we expected.</i>

699
01:20:41,314 --> 01:20:42,651
<i>Might be a good idea
to check in on Logan</i>

700
01:20:42,663 --> 01:20:44,131
<i>every one in a while</i>

701
01:20:44,143 --> 01:20:45,524
<i>to make sure
he's actually sleeping</i>

702
01:20:45,536 --> 01:20:47,265
<i>and not playing
in his closet again.</i>

703
01:20:47,277 --> 01:20:48,919
<i>Or the hamper.
This is Dr. Kubler.</i>

704
01:20:48,931 --> 01:20:50,703
<i>Honey.
Honey, shh, shh.</i>

705
01:20:50,715 --> 01:20:52,879
<i>If you get hungry, help
yourself to anything you like.</i>

706
01:20:52,891 --> 01:20:54,533
<i>Call me if you have
any questions.</i>

707
01:20:54,545 --> 01:20:57,362
<i>Bye.</i>

708
01:21:34,802 --> 01:21:36,183
<i>Power outages have been
reported throughout</i>

709
01:21:36,195 --> 01:21:37,402
<i>the Boggy Bay area.</i>

710
01:22:20,936 --> 01:22:22,708
<i>What did you want to show me?</i>

711
01:22:22,720 --> 01:22:26,277
<i>Oh, you know. Just the seven
wonders of the world.</i>

712
01:22:26,289 --> 01:22:28,714
<i>Why don't we start

<i>I actually don't think
Mount Rushmore's one of the s...</i>

714
01:22:31,120 --> 01:22:32,805
<i>Ohh.</i>

715
01:22:36,299 --> 01:22:38,115
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

01:22:38,127 --> 01:22:40,944

01:22:44,742 --> 01:22:47,385

<i>home to some of the most
dangerous criminals</i>

720
01:22:49,094 --> 01:22:51,998
<i>in this country was thrown
into chaos earlier today</i>

721
01:22:52,010 --> 01:22:55,306
<i>when a power surge fried
the building's security system,</i>

722
01:22:55,318 --> 01:22:56,829
<i>and a bloody riot broke out.</i>

723
01:22:56,841 --> 01:22:58,483
<i>Uh, we can't confirm
at the moment</i>

724
01:22:58,495 --> 01:23:00,441
<i>whether or not
any of the inmates</i>

725
01:23:00,453 --> 01:23:03,140

the perimeter of the property.</i>

726
01:23:03,152 --> 01:23:04,968
<i>But out of an abundance
of caution,</i>

727
01:23:04,980 --> 01:23:07,318
<i>we're asking residents

729
01:23:10,028 --> 01:23:11,757

<i>So, what'd you think
of, uh, Stonehenge?</i>

735
01:23:27,263 --> 01:23:30,732
<i>Smaller than I imagined. Hey, what?</i>

736
01:24:21,882 --> 01:24:25,831
<i>Got a killer on our hands,
so I'm gonna make this quick.</i>

737
01:24:25,843 --> 01:24:30,531
<i>"Caucasian, 36 years old,

738
01:24:34,504 --> 01:24:38,539
<i>A dozen teenagers
turned up dead.</i>

739
01:24:38,551 --> 01:24:40,715
<i>All the victims have been young,</i>

740
01:24:40,727 --> 01:24:43,544
<i>and all the victims
have been female</i>

741
01:24:43,556 --> 01:24:46,156
<i>and all the victims

742
01:24:48,300 --> 01:24:51,335
<i>He has no fear,
no remorse.</i>

743
01:24:51,347 --> 01:24:54,947
<i>He will stop at nothing
to get what he wants.</i>

744
01:24:54,959 --> 01:25:00,431
<i>And what he wants, mind you...
is blood.</i>

745
01:25:33,128 --> 01:25:35,335
Aah!

746
01:25:44,617 --> 01:25:47,086
Can you help me?

747
01:25:56,803 --> 01:26:01,883
Do you know where you are?

748
01:26:01,895 --> 01:26:05,496
This isn't my house.

749
01:26:05,508 --> 01:26:09,239
I'm going to be in trouble.

750
01:26:09,251 --> 01:26:11,241
You're bleeding really badly.

751
01:26:11,253 --> 01:26:13,286
I know.

752
01:26:13,298 --> 01:26:15,897
Let me help you.
No.

753
01:26:38,671 --> 01:26:40,792
Don't.
Wait. Wait.

754
01:26:40,804 --> 01:26:43,186
Wait.

755
01:26:43,198 --> 01:26:44,839
Wait!

756
01:26:48,986 --> 01:26:51,977
What are you doing?

757
01:26:51,989 --> 01:26:56,373
I'm... I'm trying
to help you.

758
01:26:59,779 --> 01:27:04,424
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.

759
01:27:06,308 --> 01:27:08,776
<i>Why the hell aren't you
answering the phone?!</i>

760
01:27:08,788 --> 01:27:10,909
<i>Listen there was a riot
over at the asylum,</i>

761
01:27:10,921 --> 01:27:14,129
<i>and a psychopath escaped.
It's the same one responsible</i>

762
01:27:14,141 --> 01:27:17,394
<i>for all those kids
that were mutilated and...</i>

763
01:27:17,406 --> 01:27:20,310
<i>Ugh. Lock the doors
and stay with Logan</i>

764
01:27:20,322 --> 01:27:21,833
<i>until we get home.</i>

765
01:28:47,017 --> 01:28:50,748
Oh, my God!

766
01:28:58,071 --> 01:29:00,932
Sam?!
Hello?! Sam?!

767
01:29:43,682 --> 01:29:45,498
Aah!

768
01:30:17,760 --> 01:30:21,665
Aah!

769
01:31:15,687 --> 01:31:18,199
Where's the boy?!

770
01:33:14,850 --> 01:33:17,580
- Logan?!
- Sam?!

771
01:33:17,592 --> 01:33:19,625
Where... is he?!

772
01:33:19,637 --> 01:33:22,280
Where's the boy?!

773
01:33:30,561 --> 01:33:33,334
Wait.

774
01:33:33,346 --> 01:33:35,728
You're not a killer.

775
01:33:46,011 --> 01:33:49,873
You're right.

776
01:33:49,885 --> 01:33:52,136
I'm not!

777
01:34:17,521 --> 01:34:19,859
This is over.

778
01:34:23,483 --> 01:34:25,865
You're right.

779
01:34:25,877 --> 01:34:27,867
Aah!

780
01:34:35,060 --> 01:34:37,311
- What was that?
- I'm going around the back.

781
01:34:37,323 --> 01:34:39,009
Harold, wait.

782
01:34:55,994 --> 01:34:57,462
<i>Aah!</i>

783
01:35:00,782 --> 01:35:02,902
Is it over?

784
01:35:02,914 --> 01:35:05,165
It's over.

785
01:35:08,050 --> 01:35:10,083
It's over.

786
01:35:23,718 --> 01:35:26,012
This is for ruining my dinner.

787
01:35:26,024 --> 01:35:28,014
Aah!

788
01:35:35,207 --> 01:35:39,025
The window's broken.
Stay behind me.

789
01:35:46,828 --> 01:35:51,385
Oh, my God!

790
01:35:51,397 --> 01:35:54,214
Who is that?

791
01:35:58,970 --> 01:36:03,049
Sam?
It's the babysitter.

792
01:36:03,061 --> 01:36:07,227
Logan!

793
01:36:11,200 --> 01:36:12,798
<i>We interrupt your program</i>

794
01:36:12,810 --> 01:36:16,019
<i>for another Action 4 News
special report.</i>

795
01:36:16,031 --> 01:36:18,282
<i>Police have confirmed
that the missing patient</i>

796
01:36:18,294 --> 01:36:20,458
<i>is Charlotte Gibbons.</i>

797
01:36:20,470 --> 01:36:22,416
<i>Known locally as the
Boggy Bay Tooth Fairy,</i>

798
01:36:22,428 --> 01:36:25,550
<i>Gibbons was convicted on 12
counts of murder and 10...</i>

799
01:36:37,966 --> 01:36:40,043
Debra?!

800
01:36:44,015 --> 01:36:45,483
I can't find Logan anywhere!

801
01:36:45,495 --> 01:36:47,267
I've done his room!

802
01:37:11,216 --> 01:37:14,599
Ohh, I see what you did there.

803
01:37:14,611 --> 01:37:18,733
Burying the lead
to throw me off... very clever.

804
01:37:18,745 --> 01:37:21,171
But I'm still confused.

805
01:37:21,183 --> 01:37:23,564
Why come back?

806
01:37:23,576 --> 01:37:25,740
You have your collection...

807
01:37:35,632 --> 01:37:37,622
...and I have mine.

808
01:37:48,079 --> 01:37:51,114
You're not going to tell anyone
my story, are you?

809
01:37:51,126 --> 01:37:54,595
Oh, of course not,
my dear.

810
01:37:57,219 --> 01:37:59,774
I'm sorry.

811
01:37:59,786 --> 01:38:03,256
In real life,
the bad guy wins.

812
01:38:22,200 --> 01:38:24,887
Oh, bravo!

813
01:38:24,899 --> 01:38:26,801
Bravo, my dear.

814
01:38:26,813 --> 01:38:30,762
But you committed
one fatal storytelling sin.

815
01:38:30,774 --> 01:38:34,244
You have underestimated
your audience.

816
01:38:39,478 --> 01:38:42,295
The job is yours.

817
01:39:24,959 --> 01:39:28,298
There's no use running.

818
01:39:37,710 --> 01:39:42,660
You're only making this harder
on yourself.

819
01:40:22,320 --> 01:40:25,181
Getting to know the place?

820
01:40:25,193 --> 01:40:28,097
What is this?

821
01:40:28,109 --> 01:40:31,752
I believe it's a library.

822
01:40:31,764 --> 01:40:33,798
You know what I mean.

823
01:40:33,810 --> 01:40:38,803
You know,
I was once just like you,

824
01:40:38,815 --> 01:40:42,937
a traveler from the outer
regions of experience

825
01:40:42,949 --> 01:40:46,985
unbounded by the laws of nature,
or so I thought.

826
01:40:51,132 --> 01:40:55,907
Then I found my way
to his house,

827
01:40:55,919 --> 01:40:59,084
this... assignment.

828
01:40:59,096 --> 01:41:02,131
And everything changed.

829
01:41:05,146 --> 01:41:09,616
Throughout history, it has been
the role of the storyteller

830
01:41:09,628 --> 01:41:15,535
to remind us that each and every
action creates a ripple,

831
01:41:15,547 --> 01:41:19,235
each and every story
has repercussions.

832
01:41:22,032 --> 01:41:26,198
And you would be surprised
how many stories

833
01:41:26,210 --> 01:41:30,985
in this library...
are yours.

834
01:42:23,485 --> 01:42:28,434
I told you...
No-one escapes fate.

835
01:42:28,446 --> 01:42:30,480
I don't care
what you say, old man.

836
01:42:30,492 --> 01:42:32,221
I'm the master of my own fate.

837
01:42:32,233 --> 01:42:34,048
I say how my story ends.

838
01:42:34,060 --> 01:42:36,399
Ends?!

839
01:42:36,411 --> 01:42:39,053
Oh, my dear girl.

840
01:42:39,065 --> 01:42:42,927
Your story is just beginning!

841
01:45:42,510 --> 01:45:44,860
Aaaah!

842
01:46:09,841 --> 01:46:15,748
Aaaaaah!

843
01:46:37,347 --> 01:46:39,685
I'd better get going.

844
01:46:39,697 --> 01:46:41,948
So soon?

845
01:46:44,310 --> 01:46:47,171
I was just about to make dinner.
