2
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:38,449
I'm sorry, Cody.

3
00:02:15,175 --> 00:02:17,215
I've had a case come back
across my desk...

4
00:02:17,216 --> 00:02:19,215
that could be a very good fit.

5
00:02:20,216 --> 00:02:22,574
Cody. He's eight.

6
00:02:22,816 --> 00:02:24,456
His birth mother died
when he was three.

7
00:02:24,517 --> 00:02:26,456
And we placed him with
a couple that...

8
00:02:26,777 --> 00:02:29,336
may turned out weren't fit.

9
00:02:29,376 --> 00:02:31,697
The second couple we placed
him with abandoned him.

10
00:02:31,738 --> 00:02:34,057
- Oh, my God.
- And I went for his annual follow up

11
00:02:34,298 --> 00:02:36,058
I found him living alone
in the apartment.

12
00:02:36,298 --> 00:02:38,497
- Alone?
- For almost a month, we think.

13
00:02:38,979 --> 00:02:41,659
Neighbors called once he started
going door to door.

14
00:02:43,858 --> 00:02:46,578
Look, I like this kid.

15
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:50,739
We're not supposed to have
opinions like that, but I do.

16
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:53,851
He's resourceful, he's resilient.

17
00:02:54,381 --> 00:02:56,380
I'm not saying these things
haven't affected him.

18
00:02:56,621 --> 00:02:59,291
- He's guarded, he has sleep issues.
- Of course.

19
00:02:59,341 --> 00:03:00,982
But for all he's been through,

20
00:03:00,982 --> 00:03:02,982
he hasn't let it turn him
into a victim.

21
00:03:04,622 --> 00:03:07,261
Witch is what made me think
of the two of you.

22
00:03:08,263 --> 00:03:09,702
Now that you've been approved,

23
00:03:09,743 --> 00:03:12,102
I think you'll make wonderful
foster parents.

24
00:03:12,343 --> 00:03:14,102
My question for you is...

25
00:03:14,823 --> 00:03:16,303
Are you ready for this?

26
00:03:26,565 --> 00:03:28,104
Okay, living room.

27
00:04:04,210 --> 00:04:05,660
We can leave that one.

28
00:04:08,351 --> 00:04:09,271
Are you sure?

29
00:04:11,111 --> 00:04:12,430
Clean slate, you know.

30
00:04:13,952 --> 00:04:15,151
Just that one.

31
00:04:19,612 --> 00:04:21,383
Whatever it was like for her,

32
00:04:22,792 --> 00:04:24,312
they said it was fast.

33
00:04:26,073 --> 00:04:28,073
And she wasn't aware
of what was happening.

34
00:04:29,394 --> 00:04:34,993
It's not nearly as bad as
I imagined in my head.

35
00:04:38,315 --> 00:04:39,994
And I find confort in that.

36
00:04:42,035 --> 00:04:43,915
It's very good, Jony.

37
00:04:44,795 --> 00:04:46,035
Anyone else?

38
00:04:49,076 --> 00:04:53,196
We have decided to bring a child
into our home tomorrow.

39
00:04:53,217 --> 00:04:56,027
- That's wonderful, Jessie. Congratulations.
- Thank you, Peter.

40
00:04:56,877 --> 00:04:58,757
How have you been feeling
these days?

41
00:05:03,558 --> 00:05:05,718
I still can't sleep at night
very well.

42
00:05:05,811 --> 00:05:07,239
- You still on Ambien?
- Yes.

43
00:05:08,439 --> 00:05:10,478
Insomnia is common.

44
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:15,719
Somnia is Latin for "Dreams".

45
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:19,480
Insomnia simply means "No Dreams".

46
00:05:21,961 --> 00:05:25,680
And what else is a child,
but our dreams?

47
00:05:26,602 --> 00:05:29,361
Our hopes, manifest.

48
00:05:31,482 --> 00:05:33,322
We talked about numbness
last week,

49
00:05:33,332 --> 00:05:34,613
where something
a lot of us has felt.

50
00:05:34,633 --> 00:05:37,353
Yeah, I don't know if I'm doing
any better with that.

51
00:05:38,003 --> 00:05:40,082
I think I'm, a little.

52
00:05:41,884 --> 00:05:45,683
but the color hasn't returned
to the world just yet.

53
00:05:46,204 --> 00:05:49,684
How Is Mark with this?
We haven't seen him for awhile.

54
00:05:50,325 --> 00:05:53,564
We always say that people
processes grief differently.

55
00:05:55,486 --> 00:05:59,005
Mark and I have had
different experiences with this.

56
00:06:00,636 --> 00:06:03,597
- The feeling distant from a spouse is...
- Common. Yes.

57
00:06:05,987 --> 00:06:10,168
I just wish I knew
how to fix this.

58
00:06:10,908 --> 00:06:13,718
For him, for us.

59
00:06:15,538 --> 00:06:19,919
And I really wish he would continue
coming to group with me because...

60
00:06:20,049 --> 00:06:22,119
it's the only time I feel...

61
00:06:22,209 --> 00:06:23,449
I don't know...

62
00:06:24,670 --> 00:06:25,730
Awake.

63
00:09:07,062 --> 00:09:09,942
- You ready?
- I think so.

64
00:09:14,653 --> 00:09:16,863
- Hey.
- Let's go say hi.

65
00:09:19,824 --> 00:09:22,264
This is Mr and Mrs Hobsen.

66
00:09:23,714 --> 00:09:25,904
- Hi.
- How are you doing?

67
00:09:26,685 --> 00:09:28,345
Good morning.

68
00:09:30,355 --> 00:09:32,505
Good morning. How are you?

69
00:09:34,486 --> 00:09:36,186
Can I take that box for you?

70
00:09:37,486 --> 00:09:41,627
No? Okay.
Whatever you want to do, pal.

71
00:09:48,368 --> 00:09:51,828
Thank you. I'll take good care of it.

72
00:09:54,388 --> 00:09:56,909
Come on, come on in.

73
00:09:57,149 --> 00:09:58,789
Here we are.

74
00:10:01,449 --> 00:10:02,930
You don't have to do that.

75
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:06,110
Shoes make floors dirty.

76
00:10:18,232 --> 00:10:20,682
- You have a beautiful home.
- Thank you.

77
00:10:20,862 --> 00:10:23,372
It's all yours, Cody.
Nothing's out limits.

78
00:10:23,392 --> 00:10:26,713
Yeah, come on,
I'll show you my Xbox, or...

79
00:10:26,883 --> 00:10:28,583
or we can get a Wii, I guess.

80
00:10:28,593 --> 00:10:31,153
I'm not sure which one you play.
But you play, though, right?

81
00:10:31,233 --> 00:10:33,384
I think Mark's pretty excited
to have someone to play.

82
00:10:33,404 --> 00:10:35,524
You ever played this connect?
Sports thing?

83
00:10:35,534 --> 00:10:38,254
It's got a censor on it,
so there is no control.

84
00:10:38,274 --> 00:10:40,205
Whatever you do,
the little dude does.

85
00:10:40,225 --> 00:10:43,395
You can swing, you can throw,
you can kick.

86
00:10:43,425 --> 00:10:47,286
And the little guy does it.
I'll show you.

87
00:10:47,716 --> 00:10:49,286
great. It's pretty mean.

88
00:10:57,007 --> 00:10:58,687
It doesn't look like much.

89
00:10:58,847 --> 00:11:00,687
We want you to decorate it
the way you like it

90
00:11:02,008 --> 00:11:04,138
- really?
- That's right.

91
00:11:08,018 --> 00:11:10,499
We're gonna replace those,
I just throw whatever in a basket,

92
00:11:10,519 --> 00:11:12,839
but you can pick out
anything you want.

93
00:11:13,879 --> 00:11:15,720
Cody collects butterflies.

94
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:18,280
- You do?
- Really?

95
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:20,190
I love this room.

96
00:11:27,251 --> 00:11:30,502
remember, it's just the first night.
We are all in this together.

97
00:11:32,462 --> 00:11:33,612
You okay?

98
00:11:33,852 --> 00:11:35,312
I like your eyes.

99
00:11:37,803 --> 00:11:38,713
Thank You.

100
00:11:39,003 --> 00:11:40,583
They're really pretty.

101
00:11:43,473 --> 00:11:45,174
Let's get some sleep.

102
00:11:45,784 --> 00:11:47,494
Good night, Mrs Hobsen.

103
00:11:48,424 --> 00:11:51,564
Good night, Cody.
Sleep tight.

104
00:12:37,471 --> 00:12:39,051
Monarch.

105
00:12:47,112 --> 00:12:48,172
Alright.

106
00:12:48,622 --> 00:12:50,533
Here. Alright.

107
00:12:50,553 --> 00:12:52,863
- What's your favorite kind of pizza?
- Pineapple.

108
00:12:52,943 --> 00:12:55,103
Yeah? That's what we're
going to have tonight.

109
00:12:55,183 --> 00:12:56,703
Celebrate your brave day.

110
00:12:57,764 --> 00:12:59,304
Let's go, you ready?

111
00:13:02,364 --> 00:13:04,905
So, let's all say "Welcome, Cody".

112
00:13:04,905 --> 00:13:07,065
Welcome, Cody.

113
00:13:07,215 --> 00:13:09,615
You can take that seat,
right over there.

114
00:13:10,405 --> 00:13:12,946
Alright, let's open those notebooks.

115
00:13:13,546 --> 00:13:14,866
Everyone ready?

116
00:13:16,134 --> 00:13:19,296
The first word is...

117
00:13:27,668 --> 00:13:29,267
Everything's right in there?

118
00:13:29,268 --> 00:13:30,467
I'm fine.

119
00:13:31,718 --> 00:13:32,828
He's fine.

120
00:13:36,679 --> 00:13:38,719
I just wanted to make sure
I can still hear him.

121
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:42,940
He's fine.

122
00:14:17,194 --> 00:14:19,795
- What's this guy?
- The Blue Morpho.

123
00:14:20,055 --> 00:14:23,065
Sounds like some kind of superhero
or something.

124
00:14:25,016 --> 00:14:27,746
And what is this?
This is like a Cocoon or something?

125
00:14:27,936 --> 00:14:31,736
That's a chrysalis. It keeps them
safe till they grown up.

126
00:14:34,097 --> 00:14:36,027
So, I guess we better
go to bed.

127
00:14:36,497 --> 00:14:38,037
Alright.

128
00:14:40,568 --> 00:14:42,688
- I'll be right there.
- Okay, sweety.

129
00:14:51,679 --> 00:14:52,679
Hey.

130
00:14:53,999 --> 00:14:56,130
So, I was straightening out
for you earlier,

131
00:14:56,250 --> 00:14:59,010
and I accidentally found
some of your stimulants.

132
00:14:59,570 --> 00:15:01,070
Stimulants?

133
00:15:01,391 --> 00:15:02,941
Things that keep you awake.

134
00:15:04,341 --> 00:15:06,881
- I don't like to sleep.
- I know.

135
00:15:06,971 --> 00:15:08,642
But there's nothing for you
to be scared of here.

136
00:15:08,792 --> 00:15:10,802
- Yes, there is.
- What?

137
00:15:11,522 --> 00:15:12,812
The Canker Man.

138
00:15:15,102 --> 00:15:16,213
Who's that?

139
00:15:16,653 --> 00:15:20,543
He comes when I sleep.
He eats people.

140
00:15:21,753 --> 00:15:23,053
Well, that's no good.

141
00:15:23,974 --> 00:15:25,394
He ate my mom.

142
00:15:31,075 --> 00:15:33,955
You know, when I was little girl,

143
00:15:34,975 --> 00:15:37,836
I thought there was a witch
scratching in my window.

144
00:15:39,666 --> 00:15:41,106
But it was just a tree.

145
00:15:42,336 --> 00:15:44,516
The branches had grown
a little too long,

146
00:15:44,536 --> 00:15:46,617
And they hit the window
when the wind blew.

147
00:15:47,777 --> 00:15:50,427
Ones I knew that, the witch
never came back.

148
00:15:52,428 --> 00:15:56,728
Sometimes scary things go away
when we understand them a little.

149
00:15:58,768 --> 00:16:00,819
Not The Canker Man.

150
00:16:01,979 --> 00:16:06,569
Well, you're in new home now.
I'm sure he can't find you.

151
00:16:06,839 --> 00:16:09,920
He's always with me, he says so.

152
00:16:13,970 --> 00:16:16,431
You did what you had to do.

153
00:16:16,441 --> 00:16:18,961
You can't let him have
a sugar stash,

154
00:16:18,971 --> 00:16:21,422
in the middle of his room,
under his bed.

155
00:16:21,442 --> 00:16:24,242
I know, I still feel like
I was trespassing.

156
00:16:24,902 --> 00:16:28,652
No. You're parenting

157
00:16:35,032 --> 00:16:37,870
<i>When you came in, you said
something about a ghost?</i>

158
00:16:37,884 --> 00:16:38,904
<i>There was something.</i>

159
00:16:39,294 --> 00:16:40,913
<i>What did it look like?</i>

160
00:16:40,994 --> 00:16:44,914
<i>Well, it was wearing a black thing
that went all the way to the floor.</i>

161
00:16:45,395 --> 00:16:47,914
<i>Weren't you a little
frightened at the time?</i>

162
00:16:48,325 --> 00:16:49,475
<i>Oh, yes.</i>

163
00:16:50,425 --> 00:16:53,415
- <i>That, Mr. Loren, is hysteria.</i>
- Jess.

164
00:16:53,626 --> 00:16:55,891
<i>Well, then doctor, how do you
explain what happened to Lance?</i>

165
00:16:55,886 --> 00:16:57,646
<i>Was that hysteria too?</i>

166
00:17:01,107 --> 00:17:03,275
<i>You better get that
checked in a day or two.</i>

167
00:17:03,276 --> 00:17:04,768
<i>Thanks, doc.</i>

168
00:17:11,738 --> 00:17:13,259
Where they come from?

169
00:17:14,549 --> 00:17:16,249
Have you ever seen this many?

170
00:17:18,229 --> 00:17:19,730
Do we have any jars?

171
00:17:23,850 --> 00:17:25,840
Butterflies even come out at night?

172
00:17:32,111 --> 00:17:35,822
Maybe there is a big pretty moths.

173
00:17:41,593 --> 00:17:43,283
- What?
- It bit me.

174
00:17:45,123 --> 00:17:47,543
- Butterfly bit you?
- No...

175
00:17:50,504 --> 00:17:52,044
Where are they coming from?

176
00:18:02,235 --> 00:18:03,426
I need a lid.

177
00:18:12,477 --> 00:18:13,537
What the hell?

178
00:18:16,667 --> 00:18:17,948
What the hell just happened?

179
00:20:40,517 --> 00:20:42,127
I saw something last night.

180
00:20:44,348 --> 00:20:45,608
I think it was Sean.

181
00:20:48,178 --> 00:20:51,279
I know we have all had
those dreams,

182
00:20:52,149 --> 00:20:54,559
and felt like we've seen
our kids out in the world.

183
00:20:57,819 --> 00:20:59,040
But this was different.

184
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:07,211
And I couldn't help but feel
that it was because...

185
00:21:09,571 --> 00:21:10,521
Go ahead.

186
00:21:15,272 --> 00:21:17,852
He knows about Cody.

187
00:21:19,402 --> 00:21:22,093
And he's angry with me.

188
00:21:24,323 --> 00:21:25,623
For replacing him?

189
00:21:28,934 --> 00:21:29,744
Yeah.

190
00:21:30,234 --> 00:21:33,294
We talked about something
ike this at the begining,

191
00:21:33,394 --> 00:21:35,745
when Mark wanted to sell
the house,

192
00:21:35,895 --> 00:21:38,905
- but you refused, because...
- I felt like he was still there.

193
00:21:41,846 --> 00:21:44,226
You said you saw him sometimes.

194
00:21:45,326 --> 00:21:46,366
Yes.

195
00:21:49,997 --> 00:21:50,947
Okay.

196
00:21:53,457 --> 00:21:55,647
The thing you need to understand
about the dreams

197
00:21:56,277 --> 00:21:59,588
you can lose at dreams, it's can feel
very real while we having them.

198
00:21:59,598 --> 00:22:00,818
This wasn't a dream.

199
00:22:01,648 --> 00:22:03,078
- I was awake.
- Doesn't matter.

200
00:22:03,338 --> 00:22:06,789
If we're suppressing negative
emotions like guilt or fear,

201
00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:10,029
especially for sleep deprived
on top of that,

202
00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:13,110
our subconscious will figure out
a way to process those emotions.

203
00:22:14,180 --> 00:22:15,440
Even if we're awake.

204
00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:20,111
We can even achieve levels of
REM's sleep while we're awake.

205
00:22:20,751 --> 00:22:22,701
It's called "a waking dream".

206
00:22:23,421 --> 00:22:24,841
It's more common than you think.

207
00:22:25,131 --> 00:22:26,642
Just felt very real.

208
00:22:28,312 --> 00:22:30,372
Yeah, I'm sure it did.

209
00:22:31,532 --> 00:22:34,603
But, waking dream,
any dreams actually,

210
00:22:35,163 --> 00:22:39,383
are convorsation that we're
having with ourselfs.

211
00:22:40,534 --> 00:22:44,184
Every character in your dreams
is actually just you.

212
00:22:45,204 --> 00:22:48,405
And when we're trying to
bury uncomfortable emotions,

213
00:22:48,825 --> 00:22:51,915
or ideas, or we feel threatened,

214
00:22:52,785 --> 00:22:57,086
sometimes the only outlet they
have is our subconscious.

215
00:23:00,086 --> 00:23:02,467
It's normal for us to feel huanted,

216
00:23:03,427 --> 00:23:07,257
by our past, by our losses,
by the children we lost.

217
00:23:10,708 --> 00:23:12,128
But, Jessie, know.

218
00:23:14,228 --> 00:23:16,469
Sean is not haunting your home.

219
00:23:20,139 --> 00:23:23,469
The question is what are you
trying to say to yourself?

220
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:28,160
What unresolved emotions
are strangling to get out?

221
00:23:36,331 --> 00:23:37,601
That's pretty.

222
00:23:38,422 --> 00:23:39,912
It's a monarch.

223
00:23:40,912 --> 00:23:43,222
Don't they have...

224
00:23:46,903 --> 00:23:48,373
I guess so.

225
00:23:58,174 --> 00:24:00,425
Thank god, where did you
find him this time?

226
00:24:00,445 --> 00:24:03,395
He's in the maintenance shed,
which will be locked from now on.

227
00:24:03,995 --> 00:24:06,045
Oh, No. Not your seat.

228
00:24:06,565 --> 00:24:08,126
You know where you going.

229
00:24:21,547 --> 00:24:22,878
Is this everything?

230
00:24:23,878 --> 00:24:25,008
I'll do sweep.

231
00:24:45,251 --> 00:24:46,341
Hey, pal.

232
00:24:48,271 --> 00:24:51,312
How are you doing?
Are you alright?

233
00:24:51,502 --> 00:24:52,882
Who is that?

234
00:24:55,702 --> 00:24:59,823
Well, it's our son.
His name was Sean.

235
00:25:02,593 --> 00:25:04,063
Where is he?

236
00:25:05,473 --> 00:25:06,534
Well...

237
00:25:06,744 --> 00:25:07,924
He's in heaven.

238
00:25:11,114 --> 00:25:12,885
That's where my mom is.

239
00:25:16,855 --> 00:25:18,405
Tell me, what was she like?

240
00:25:20,206 --> 00:25:22,036
I don't remember her.

241
00:25:25,236 --> 00:25:27,326
How did Sean go to heaven?

242
00:25:32,117 --> 00:25:33,647
We wish he hadn't.

243
00:25:35,768 --> 00:25:37,988
As like I'm sure you wish
your mom hadn't.

244
00:25:42,999 --> 00:25:44,449
He looks fun.

245
00:26:09,362 --> 00:26:11,032
<i>Are you in fear losing your car?</i>

246
00:26:11,052 --> 00:26:12,043
<i>Sounds familiar?</i>

247
00:26:12,043 --> 00:26:15,193
<i>If you owe more than ten thousand
dollars to the bank or the IRS,</i>

248
00:26:15,213 --> 00:26:17,173
<i>then, you're qualified for
a debt relief program.</i>

00:26:38,806 --> 00:26:42,027
Hey, Jess.

254
00:26:42,437 --> 00:26:44,627
Look who's back.

255
00:26:50,688 --> 00:26:52,418
where the hell they coming from?

256
00:28:22,681 --> 00:28:23,601
No.

257
00:28:24,351 --> 00:28:25,401
No.

258
00:28:34,632 --> 00:28:36,262
I'm sorry.

259
00:29:23,939 --> 00:29:25,449
He's real.

260
00:29:27,990 --> 00:29:29,350
You saw him.

261
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:32,920
Touched him.

262
00:29:34,050 --> 00:29:36,811
I did, I was right there.

263
00:29:52,953 --> 00:29:54,583
I'm sorry.

264
00:29:58,034 --> 00:29:59,064
Why?

265
00:30:00,524 --> 00:30:02,414
My dream.

266
00:30:05,335 --> 00:30:06,835
What do you mean, Cody?

267
00:30:07,955 --> 00:30:09,455
What happens when you dream?

268
00:30:13,376 --> 00:30:17,846
I won't do it again.
Please, don't be mad.

269
00:30:19,167 --> 00:30:22,697
- Oh, hey. Pal, we're not...
- Honey, we're not mad.

270
00:30:26,848 --> 00:30:29,198
I hope you have a good day, Jessie.

271
00:30:30,138 --> 00:30:31,498
You too.

272
00:31:13,114 --> 00:31:15,114
I wish we could've heard his voice.

273
00:31:33,567 --> 00:31:35,287
Alright, who wants to set the table?

274
00:31:35,807 --> 00:31:37,947
- Come on, buddy.
- Pizza!

275
00:31:39,658 --> 00:31:43,518
- I think you have to dive into the water.
- Okay, you're... okay.

276
00:31:47,879 --> 00:31:50,299
Okay, That's one more
round for you, buddy.

277
00:31:50,309 --> 00:31:51,309
Hey, Cody.

278
00:31:51,899 --> 00:31:54,970
You know, yesterday you were
asking about Sean?

279
00:31:58,160 --> 00:31:59,320
You want to see him?

280
00:32:02,011 --> 00:32:03,641
Yes, please.

281
00:32:13,292 --> 00:32:15,673
When's the last time you
had a real Christmas?

282
00:32:17,983 --> 00:32:19,463
I don't know.

283
00:32:21,483 --> 00:32:22,914
You will this year.

284
00:32:23,804 --> 00:32:26,674
- <i>Here he comes, here he comes.</i>
- <i>He's coming, he's coming.</i>

285
00:32:31,185 --> 00:32:33,045
- <i>He came! He came!</i>
- That's him.

286
00:32:33,065 --> 00:32:34,875
<i>Merry Christmas, baby!</i>

287
00:32:36,765 --> 00:32:37,966
<i>What do you think?</i>

288
00:32:38,086 --> 00:32:40,366
- <i>I think it's a train.</i>
- <i>Why? Did it whistle?</i>

289
00:32:40,486 --> 00:32:42,846
<i>Oh, did Sean write train?
I don't remember...</i>

290
00:32:43,586 --> 00:32:45,457
<i>you sent to Santa
you think about the train.</i>

291
00:32:49,397 --> 00:32:50,287
<i>What is it?</i>

292
00:32:51,217 --> 00:32:52,308
<i>I can't see it.</i>

293
00:32:53,308 --> 00:32:54,588
<i>What do you think, hun?</i>

294
00:32:54,758 --> 00:32:56,958
<i>North Pole Express.
Do you know who lives in there?</i>

295
00:32:56,978 --> 00:32:58,789
<i>North Pole Express.</i>

296
00:32:58,909 --> 00:33:01,369
<i>- Santa lives there.
- Yes, he lives there.</i>

297
00:33:01,389 --> 00:33:03,369
<i>North Pole Express.</i>

298
00:33:20,622 --> 00:33:23,192
<i>Oh my god, come on,
fight back, buddy.</i>

299
00:33:23,332 --> 00:33:24,552
<i>You can escape.</i>

300
00:33:33,133 --> 00:33:35,904
He used to give me Eskimo kisses.

301
00:33:37,804 --> 00:33:39,024
You see how he does that?

302
00:33:43,485 --> 00:33:44,955
<i>Where you going, buddy?</i>

303
00:33:48,945 --> 00:33:51,896
That's right, you didn't sleep well
last night, right?

304
00:33:53,186 --> 00:33:55,476
In this house it's okay for you
to relax.

305
00:33:56,836 --> 00:33:58,037
You're home.

306
00:33:59,687 --> 00:34:01,187
Now get some sleep.

307
00:34:13,889 --> 00:34:15,339
I'm putting on another pot.

308
00:34:15,749 --> 00:34:17,629
Oh, let's call it the night.

309
00:34:17,859 --> 00:34:20,880
- he's a tough, and he needs to sleep.
- I know, baby. so do we.

310
00:34:22,210 --> 00:34:23,660
Let's go to bed.

311
00:34:24,770 --> 00:34:26,020
I'm going to make another pot.

312
00:34:27,341 --> 00:34:29,101
Okay. I'll go to bed.

313
00:34:39,652 --> 00:34:40,693
Jess.

314
00:34:43,743 --> 00:34:45,053
Jess.

315
00:35:27,019 --> 00:35:28,959
He came! He came!

316
00:35:39,911 --> 00:35:41,881
I think it's a train!

317
00:35:44,481 --> 00:35:46,902
Why? Did it whistle?

318
00:36:22,677 --> 00:36:23,687
Cody.

319
00:37:02,682 --> 00:37:06,703
<i>I am always with you.</i>

320
00:37:44,168 --> 00:37:45,628
Let's go to bed.

321
00:38:01,350 --> 00:38:02,730
What is that?

322
00:38:07,051 --> 00:38:08,251
The Canker Man.

323
00:38:09,731 --> 00:38:13,872
Sometimes, if I do this,
it keeps him away.

324
00:38:26,544 --> 00:38:29,364
- Boys are home.
- Hi there.

325
00:38:29,384 --> 00:38:30,894
Okay, go on.

326
00:38:44,146 --> 00:38:47,676
- Are you hungry?
- Yeah, I'm a little hunger.

327
00:38:47,686 --> 00:38:49,127
Yeah? Okay.

328
00:38:49,147 --> 00:38:50,757
Why don't you go upstairs,
and wash your hands,

329
00:38:50,767 --> 00:38:52,437
and come back and tell me
all about your day?

330
00:38:52,897 --> 00:38:54,637
Okay? Okay.

331
00:38:58,568 --> 00:38:59,858
Are we going to talk about this?

332
00:39:31,252 --> 00:39:32,703
He needs to sleep.

333
00:39:34,233 --> 00:39:36,033
Okay, he needs to sleep.

334
00:39:36,133 --> 00:39:38,133
Yeah, Cody needs to sleep.

335
00:39:41,294 --> 00:39:43,204
But, Jessie,
is that what it is about?

336
00:39:43,414 --> 00:39:44,924
Or is this about Sean?

337
00:39:49,895 --> 00:39:50,685
Okay.

338
00:39:56,386 --> 00:39:57,426
What are you doing?

339
00:39:57,996 --> 00:39:59,456
This feels wrong, Jess.

340
00:40:00,516 --> 00:40:01,417
This...

341
00:40:02,487 --> 00:40:05,637
I felt wrong...

342
00:40:06,357 --> 00:40:09,448
when you... you puting that DVD.

343
00:40:09,468 --> 00:40:10,928
And then...

344
00:40:11,728 --> 00:40:13,288
It hasn'n felt right since.

345
00:40:14,718 --> 00:40:16,279
It feels like abuse.

346
00:40:16,939 --> 00:40:18,309
- Abuse?
- Yeah.

347
00:40:20,329 --> 00:40:20,879
Abuse?

348
00:40:20,889 --> 00:40:24,770
We promised to take care
of that child.

349
00:40:25,710 --> 00:40:30,291
Not use him like some
home movie projector for...

350
00:40:30,311 --> 00:40:34,291
That child needs to sleep.

351
00:40:35,601 --> 00:40:38,492
And if he can help us heal...

352
00:40:39,082 --> 00:40:41,452
We need to heal, Mark.

353
00:40:43,652 --> 00:40:46,463
- He can help us heal.
- This is not healing.

354
00:40:46,463 --> 00:40:48,463
I saw it in your face.
You felt it too.

355
00:40:49,693 --> 00:40:52,614
Yeah, of course.

356
00:40:56,414 --> 00:40:58,454
If you want to go to bed,
go to bed.

357
00:40:59,965 --> 00:41:00,735
Jess.

358
00:41:00,735 --> 00:41:02,735
I'm staying here,
and I'm waiting for Sean.

359
00:41:03,915 --> 00:41:07,216
Well, it's not our son,
and it's not Sean,

360
00:41:07,236 --> 00:41:09,936
and it's not our son.

361
00:41:10,266 --> 00:41:12,616
I'm not going to let you
take him away from me again.

362
00:41:16,757 --> 00:41:17,767
Again?

363
00:41:19,817 --> 00:41:20,937
hey.

364
00:41:22,968 --> 00:41:24,188
I'm sorry.

365
00:41:24,768 --> 00:41:26,268
- Again?
- I'm sorry.

366
00:41:31,479 --> 00:41:34,859
No. Not fair.

367
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:39,580
It's not fair. Not fair.

368
00:41:51,372 --> 00:41:52,932
You all set?

369
00:41:52,952 --> 00:41:54,502
Okay, go ahead

370
00:42:16,995 --> 00:42:18,985
You started it, Tate.

371
00:42:29,747 --> 00:42:31,507
Thirteen plus five?

372
00:42:32,107 --> 00:42:33,677
- Hayden?
- Eighteen?

373
00:42:33,677 --> 00:42:34,668
Yes.

374
00:42:37,108 --> 00:42:38,788
Fifteen plus four?

375
00:42:39,288 --> 00:42:40,588
- Hunter?
- Nineteen.

376
00:42:40,728 --> 00:42:41,489
Good.

377
00:42:44,199 --> 00:42:45,889
Seven plus thirteen?

378
00:42:48,249 --> 00:42:50,030
- Clara?
- Twenty?

379
00:42:50,490 --> 00:42:51,510
Nice.

380
00:42:53,950 --> 00:42:55,190
Nine plus fourteen.

381
00:42:55,320 --> 00:42:56,631
This time is fine.

382
00:42:56,771 --> 00:42:58,511
but if you're not
feeling well for recess,

383
00:42:58,531 --> 00:43:00,471
maybe you should visit
the nurses room.

384
00:43:07,432 --> 00:43:09,592
Can I just stay here?

385
00:43:12,433 --> 00:43:14,473
I have to step out,
just for a minute,

386
00:43:14,483 --> 00:43:16,193
Why not you put your
head down and rest?

387
00:45:05,408 --> 00:45:06,729
Cody, what's going on?

388
00:45:06,739 --> 00:45:07,849
Let's go home.

389
00:45:07,859 --> 00:45:08,839
What happened?

390
00:45:09,079 --> 00:45:10,559
A kid run away.

391
00:45:10,729 --> 00:45:11,729
What?

392
00:45:12,169 --> 00:45:14,330
He's done it before.
He's a mean kid.

393
00:45:14,330 --> 00:45:16,090
Can we go home, please?

394
00:45:18,510 --> 00:45:19,610
Okay.

395
00:45:26,381 --> 00:45:27,411
You okay?

396
00:45:28,702 --> 00:45:29,962
I'm fine.

397
00:45:30,232 --> 00:45:32,692
Well, we didn't see very much
even the night.

398
00:45:33,382 --> 00:45:36,323
I'm sorry, I don't feel a very well.

399
00:45:36,543 --> 00:45:37,933
Don't feel well?

400
00:45:38,943 --> 00:45:40,533
Let's have a look at you.

401
00:45:44,014 --> 00:45:46,334
Worried about what happened
at school today?

402
00:45:47,614 --> 00:45:51,335
Well, I think it's going to be okay,
that little boy is going to turn up.

403
00:46:01,136 --> 00:46:03,296
- Good night.
- Good night.

404
00:46:04,156 --> 00:46:06,137
Well, You...

405
00:46:06,797 --> 00:46:08,737
You're going to use
some sleep too, you know?

406
00:46:09,457 --> 00:46:10,657
I'll be in soon.

407
00:46:11,457 --> 00:46:12,498
Okay.

408
00:48:33,557 --> 00:48:36,637
I'm awake, this can't be hapening.

409
00:48:36,657 --> 00:48:40,038
I'm awake, this can't be hapening.

410
00:48:48,039 --> 00:48:50,719
No! No, no!

411
00:48:51,489 --> 00:48:54,280
- I'm awake. I'm awake.
- I'm awake. I'm awake.

412
00:48:54,280 --> 00:48:57,440
- I'm awake.
- I'm awake.

413
00:48:57,450 --> 00:48:58,520
I'm awake.

414
00:49:00,001 --> 00:49:01,961
No! No!

415
00:49:01,961 --> 00:49:03,961
- No! I'm awake!
- Cody? Cody?!

416
00:49:03,961 --> 00:49:05,721
- No! Stop!
- Cody, stop.

417
00:49:05,751 --> 00:49:09,692
- I'm awake! I'm awake!
- I got you. I got you.

418
00:49:09,722 --> 00:49:14,042
I'm awake. I'm awake.
- I got you. Hey, I got you.

419
00:49:14,042 --> 00:49:18,323
- I'm awake. I'm awake.
- Oh, it's okay, baby. It's okay.

420
00:49:20,253 --> 00:49:23,204
I'm sick.
I don't want to go to school.

421
00:49:23,564 --> 00:49:24,604
Sick, huh?

422
00:49:24,784 --> 00:49:25,894
Yes, sir.

423
00:49:25,894 --> 00:49:26,989
That's too bad.

424
00:49:27,924 --> 00:49:31,165
I guess you won't be interested in
do a little shopping today.

425
00:49:31,975 --> 00:49:34,165
Pick up some stuff
for your new room.

426
00:49:34,175 --> 00:49:36,246
I don't think I deserve to.

427
00:49:39,146 --> 00:49:43,447
If there is one thing I know,
you deserve a good day.

428
00:49:44,967 --> 00:49:47,607
- How long hasn't he slept?
- At least two days.

429
00:49:47,617 --> 00:49:49,527
But it's been going on
since he first got home.

430
00:49:49,537 --> 00:49:52,088
I'm giving him Zolpidem.
It's a paediatric Ambien.

431
00:49:52,108 --> 00:49:53,848
Just a pill before bedtime
should do the trick.

432
00:49:53,848 --> 00:49:57,208
<i>Dr. Petrom room six, one.
Dr. Petrom room six, one.</i>

433
00:49:57,568 --> 00:49:58,769
It's just to get him started.

434
00:49:58,769 --> 00:50:00,769
We can't let him stay up
for days on end.

435
00:50:00,889 --> 00:50:03,369
Sleep deprivation at this age
can do real damage.

436
00:50:04,979 --> 00:50:06,030
Thank you.

437
00:50:19,591 --> 00:50:21,492
- Hi.
- Hi.

438
00:50:28,713 --> 00:50:30,013
Can I help you guys?

439
00:50:30,023 --> 00:50:33,493
I'm detective Brown,
this is officer Murray.

440
00:50:34,253 --> 00:50:35,854
We like to ask your son
a few questions

441
00:50:35,864 --> 00:50:37,914
about an incident that
took place at school.

442
00:50:38,964 --> 00:50:40,844
Cody, come here.

443
00:50:48,275 --> 00:50:50,376
- Okay, screw.
- Screw.

444
00:50:52,296 --> 00:50:54,696
- Phillips.
- Phillips.

445
00:51:02,447 --> 00:51:05,378
Just be sure you cough or something
when you get downstairs, okay?

446
00:51:12,679 --> 00:51:14,299
Hey, there he is.

447
00:51:14,639 --> 00:51:17,099
- You look better.
- I feel a little better.

448
00:51:17,379 --> 00:51:20,690
- Good.
- So, the police came by today.

449
00:51:21,260 --> 00:51:23,260
- What they want?
- Well...

450
00:51:23,260 --> 00:51:24,620
I feel a lot better.

451
00:51:24,640 --> 00:51:26,261
Do you want to see
my race car bed?

452
00:51:26,261 --> 00:51:28,541
- Race car bed?
- I was getting to that.

453
00:51:29,061 --> 00:51:31,741
I think this little kid
still hasn't shown back up.

454
00:51:32,061 --> 00:51:33,442
So, why they came here?

455
00:51:33,612 --> 00:51:36,272
Well, I guess they have to
rule out abduction.

456
00:51:36,702 --> 00:51:38,302
I guess Cody saw the kid leave.

457
00:51:38,432 --> 00:51:39,702
How did Sean die?

458
00:51:42,843 --> 00:51:43,743
What?

459
00:51:46,393 --> 00:51:48,224
I just wondered.

460
00:51:55,185 --> 00:51:56,265
Hey, buddy.

461
00:51:56,415 --> 00:51:58,825
Why not you go set the table?
Okay?

462
00:51:59,825 --> 00:52:00,945
We'll be in in minute.

463
00:52:36,270 --> 00:52:37,670
Nice.

464
00:52:37,870 --> 00:52:40,591
Like Tik Tak Tok game.
I'm playing it always.

465
00:52:42,861 --> 00:52:45,031
- Hi.
- Hi.

466
00:52:46,542 --> 00:52:49,432
- What do you think?
- That is orange.

467
00:52:50,152 --> 00:52:52,392
Weren't you glad
we didn't go with fuchsia?

468
00:52:53,183 --> 00:52:55,593
- What's this?
- Here you go.

469
00:52:58,273 --> 00:53:00,074
Alright.

470
00:53:00,634 --> 00:53:03,714
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

471
00:53:05,934 --> 00:53:07,355
Using fork?

472
00:53:09,075 --> 00:53:10,675
This is very civilized.

473
00:53:27,927 --> 00:53:31,518
- Today was fun.
- Today was my favorite day so far.

474
00:53:31,978 --> 00:53:34,638
Yeah? Mine, too.

475
00:53:36,559 --> 00:53:37,639
Hey, listen...

476
00:53:39,379 --> 00:53:41,599
About the question that
you asked me...

477
00:53:43,319 --> 00:53:44,520
...earlier.

478
00:53:46,910 --> 00:53:50,560
Sean drowned.
It was an accident.

479
00:53:52,201 --> 00:53:56,241
And then, we found out
we couldn't have more kids, so...

480
00:53:57,301 --> 00:53:59,642
I'm sorry I asked about that.

481
00:54:01,472 --> 00:54:03,632
No, no. It's...

482
00:54:03,922 --> 00:54:06,003
You have the right to know.

483
00:54:06,443 --> 00:54:09,043
It's just important to you also
to know that...

484
00:54:09,043 --> 00:54:11,803
nothing like that is
going to happen to you.

485
00:54:35,247 --> 00:54:36,407
You okay?

486
00:54:39,877 --> 00:54:41,287
I don't think I am.

487
00:54:43,298 --> 00:54:45,048
You're a great mom.

488
00:54:49,569 --> 00:54:51,129
That kid up there...

489
00:54:54,129 --> 00:54:55,609
He needs a great mom.

490
00:54:57,090 --> 00:54:59,210
You need a kid.
It's a perfect match.

491
00:55:01,090 --> 00:55:03,050
We don't need anything else.

492
00:55:14,442 --> 00:55:16,852
I know that you think you do.

493
00:55:17,862 --> 00:55:21,413
And god knows there's a big
part of me it feels the same.

494
00:55:25,413 --> 00:55:26,654
But we don't.

495
00:55:37,505 --> 00:55:38,735
Come to bed.

496
00:55:47,276 --> 00:55:48,537
Come to bed.

497
00:55:51,087 --> 00:55:52,017
Okay.

498
00:55:57,748 --> 00:55:59,098
Yes, love.

499
00:56:34,633 --> 00:56:35,923
Sean?

500
00:56:48,395 --> 00:56:51,345
Cody, Cody.
Wake up, wake up.

501
00:57:00,207 --> 00:57:02,427
- Wake up, hunny. Wake up!
- Mark.

502
00:57:02,957 --> 00:57:03,947
Won't wake up.

503
00:57:04,597 --> 00:57:06,507
He won't, for a while.

504
00:57:08,028 --> 00:57:10,228
- What did you do?
- He's...

505
00:57:11,068 --> 00:57:12,228
Cody!

506
00:57:13,728 --> 00:57:16,509
Cody, Cody! Wake up!

507
00:57:17,429 --> 00:57:18,829
Come on, wake up.

508
00:57:45,343 --> 00:57:46,753
Get out of here!

509
00:58:08,996 --> 00:58:11,556
She won't wake up.
She won't wake up.

510
00:58:11,966 --> 00:58:13,197
Here.

511
00:58:13,467 --> 00:58:16,477
She's awake. She's awake.

512
00:58:21,758 --> 00:58:23,678
I like to take your formal
statement, Mrs Hobsen

513
00:58:23,698 --> 00:58:26,518
and then, refer you to someone
in social services.

514
00:58:27,058 --> 00:58:30,119
- Social services?
- Why did you drug the child?

515
00:58:30,919 --> 00:58:31,999
I...

516
00:58:32,409 --> 00:58:37,080
gave him a sleeping pill.
His doctor prescribed it.

517
00:58:38,280 --> 00:58:39,640
You know the whereabouts
of your husband

518
00:58:39,650 --> 00:58:41,540
day before last
around lunch time?

519
00:58:41,560 --> 00:58:42,361
Where you taking him?

520
00:58:42,371 --> 00:58:44,561
We have any reason
to be near of your son's school?

521
00:58:44,561 --> 00:58:47,371
- No, no, no, no, no.
- Ma'am, Ma'am.

522
00:58:47,391 --> 00:58:48,441
I'm sorry.

523
00:58:48,441 --> 00:58:50,853
Ma'am, we have to remove
the child from the house.

524
00:58:50,892 --> 00:58:52,452
- No, please.
- Ma'am, please.

525
00:58:52,452 --> 00:58:54,362
You can't take him away.

526
00:59:37,928 --> 00:59:39,208
Natalie.

527
00:59:39,703 --> 00:59:41,689
You haven't returned
my phone calls.

528
00:59:42,380 --> 00:59:45,489
I was at the police station, all night.

529
00:59:46,984 --> 00:59:48,090
Where is he?

530
00:59:50,941 --> 00:59:52,690
It's not your business any more.

531
00:59:54,020 --> 00:59:55,291
Where's your husband?

532
00:59:56,411 --> 00:59:57,581
I don't know.

533
00:59:58,106 --> 00:59:59,851
That's why I have to talk with Cody.

534
00:59:59,866 --> 01:00:01,251
That's not going to happen.

535
01:00:01,771 --> 01:00:03,652
I need to find out more
about him.

536
01:00:04,782 --> 01:00:06,112
About his dreams.

537
01:00:11,130 --> 01:00:12,653
You've heard this before.

538
01:00:17,724 --> 01:00:19,576
There're several great spport
groups in here,

539
01:00:19,585 --> 01:00:22,494
and a few therapists who
specialize in domestic violence.

540
01:00:22,814 --> 01:00:25,335
I want you to reach out,
get some help for your situation.

541
01:00:25,735 --> 01:00:27,575
And I never want to see you again.

542
01:01:07,961 --> 01:01:10,021
Yeah, I'm so able
to take care of it.

543
01:01:10,021 --> 01:01:11,501
- Great. Thanks.
- Yeah.

544
01:01:12,151 --> 01:01:14,381
- Hi, can I help you?
- I'm here to see Whelan Young.

545
01:01:20,642 --> 01:01:22,743
Whelan, you have a visitor.

546
01:01:24,353 --> 01:01:25,503
Thank you.

547
01:01:27,993 --> 01:01:29,303
What can I do for you?

548
01:01:30,664 --> 01:01:32,694
I'm here to talk about Cody Morgan.

549
01:01:44,956 --> 01:01:48,186
It says here that you
and your wife Katharina

550
01:01:48,666 --> 01:01:50,946
fostered Cody for 15 months

551
01:01:50,957 --> 01:01:54,947
before he was gaven to
Peter and Doris Clemens.

552
01:01:56,267 --> 01:01:57,707
Wouldn't know about them.

553
01:01:58,728 --> 01:02:00,508
They disappeared a year ago.

554
01:02:01,668 --> 01:02:02,908
Much like your wife.

555
01:02:04,748 --> 01:02:06,549
What are we talking
about here, Miss?

556
01:02:07,509 --> 01:02:09,869
We're talking about
what happens when he dreams.

557
01:02:12,239 --> 01:02:13,430
I've seen it, too.

558
01:02:14,310 --> 01:02:16,190
You have now?

559
01:02:18,630 --> 01:02:22,351
I watched it take my husband.

560
01:02:23,391 --> 01:02:25,311
I wouldn't say that around here.

561
01:02:26,295 --> 01:02:27,952
They fit you for slippers.

562
01:02:29,292 --> 01:02:30,792
If you don't know
what I'm talking about,

563
01:02:30,792 --> 01:02:33,232
- then I'm wasting importent time.
- Hey, wait.

564
01:02:34,672 --> 01:02:35,833
I'm sorry.

565
01:02:35,833 --> 01:02:37,710
You know, I hear "you're crazy"
for so long

566
01:02:37,710 --> 01:02:39,553
before you start to believe it.

567
01:02:41,453 --> 01:02:42,316
Please.

568
01:02:48,714 --> 01:02:51,075
That little boy's dreams
come true.

569
01:02:53,715 --> 01:02:56,595
Real and true.

570
01:02:57,536 --> 01:03:01,556
It's an amazing, beautiful thing.

571
01:03:02,876 --> 01:03:04,997
But so to his nightmares...

572
01:03:06,357 --> 01:03:07,957
They're...

573
01:03:07,977 --> 01:03:09,057
Dangerous.

574
01:03:12,158 --> 01:03:13,198
Deadly.

575
01:03:14,426 --> 01:03:15,929
Can I get him back?

576
01:03:17,413 --> 01:03:18,839
My husband?

577
01:03:22,970 --> 01:03:24,439
I don't know.

578
01:03:24,799 --> 01:03:30,040
Wherever that thing comes from,
it takes them with it.

579
01:03:30,873 --> 01:03:34,021
If they exist at all,
it's only in Cody's mind

580
01:03:34,047 --> 01:03:35,321
How do you know that?

581
01:03:36,909 --> 01:03:39,541
Katie and I fostered
two kids before Cody.

582
01:03:40,207 --> 01:03:42,902
His mother died, no other family.

583
01:03:43,692 --> 01:03:47,871
He was sweet, independent.

584
01:03:47,871 --> 01:03:49,683
An artist, I thought.

585
01:03:51,923 --> 01:03:53,683
Started with the butterflies.

586
01:04:19,927 --> 01:04:21,967
That went on for a few weeks.

587
01:04:22,284 --> 01:04:25,448
We though it was magical.

588
01:04:26,819 --> 01:04:28,488
And then, Katie got sick.

589
01:04:29,568 --> 01:04:31,008
had a bad flu.

590
01:04:34,189 --> 01:04:37,129
And it seemed to really upset Cody.

591
01:04:43,520 --> 01:04:44,850
And then...

592
01:05:06,033 --> 01:05:08,214
No!

593
01:05:22,809 --> 01:05:24,456
I'm sorry.

594
01:05:59,271 --> 01:06:00,741
But wasn't Katie.

595
01:06:02,861 --> 01:06:06,622
It was jus his impression of her.

596
01:06:08,902 --> 01:06:10,902
That was all what was left.

597
01:06:14,540 --> 01:06:16,023
He was too young.

598
01:06:18,063 --> 01:06:19,783
He was too young...

599
01:06:21,264 --> 01:06:24,124
to even remember her right.

600
01:06:27,784 --> 01:06:29,785
And I hated him for that.

601
01:06:31,445 --> 01:06:34,945
I know I shouldn't have,
but god help me I hated him for that.

602
01:06:41,226 --> 01:06:42,947
But I couldn't do it.

603
01:06:43,467 --> 01:06:44,947
I couldn't do it.

604
01:06:47,629 --> 01:06:51,028
If I had, you're husband
would be alive.

605
01:06:51,868 --> 01:06:54,068
That another family would be alive.

606
01:06:56,108 --> 01:06:57,709
Maybe you can...

607
01:06:59,909 --> 01:07:01,909
succeed where I failed.

608
01:07:02,529 --> 01:07:03,829
No.

609
01:07:05,390 --> 01:07:06,300
No.

610
01:07:06,320 --> 01:07:07,440
It's the only way.

611
01:07:07,590 --> 01:07:09,790
Thank you for your time.

612
01:07:11,030 --> 01:07:13,191
And I'm sorry for your loss,
as well.

613
01:07:13,211 --> 01:07:15,091
You really want to bet your life
to an eighteen year old boy

614
01:07:15,111 --> 01:07:17,271
 won't have another nightmare?

615
01:07:20,112 --> 01:07:22,872
- It's not his fault.
- It'd be a mercy.

616
01:07:23,552 --> 01:07:25,512
Someone has to do it.

617
01:07:26,593 --> 01:07:28,673
Do you know anything
about his birth mother?

618
01:07:30,033 --> 01:07:31,313
There's nothing in the file.

619
01:07:32,513 --> 01:07:34,074
Only that she died.

620
01:07:37,182 --> 01:07:39,594
I assume the way my wife did.

621
01:07:41,875 --> 01:07:43,635
The way your husband did.

622
01:07:46,355 --> 01:07:47,955
What you hoping to find?

623
01:08:46,594 --> 01:08:49,324
Dr. Tennant told me not to come back
without the patient file.

624
01:08:49,334 --> 01:08:50,524
He's try to call.

625
01:08:50,824 --> 01:08:52,764
Do you have the PID?

626
01:08:52,924 --> 01:08:55,765
I don't, all I have is
a last name and a date.

627
01:09:01,766 --> 01:09:03,926
Night nurse said he didn't
sleep last night.

628
01:09:04,246 --> 01:09:05,726
That's two nights in a row, then.

629
01:09:06,546 --> 01:09:07,806
That we know of.

630
01:09:08,207 --> 01:09:10,847
Policy says that we can't
let him go this long.

631
01:09:12,327 --> 01:09:15,568
I'd like to stay here with him
tonight if that's okay.

632
01:09:21,728 --> 01:09:24,479
You signed for the file,
you can take it.

633
01:09:31,610 --> 01:09:33,810
There is a PE numbere here
on the intake.

634
01:09:33,810 --> 01:09:35,490
How long you keep those?

635
01:09:36,250 --> 01:09:38,971
If nobody claim them, there's a chance
they're still down there.

636
01:10:24,257 --> 01:10:25,817
No! No!

637
01:10:26,007 --> 01:10:27,777
- Cody, its for your own good.
- Honey, it's alright.

638
01:10:27,797 --> 01:10:29,778
I don't want to hurt anymore.

639
01:10:29,818 --> 01:10:31,338
It'll take a second.

640
01:10:35,268 --> 01:10:36,729
Good job, son.

641
01:10:37,419 --> 01:10:38,599
It's okay.

642
01:10:40,979 --> 01:10:42,459
A case of mine was transferred,

643
01:10:42,469 --> 01:10:44,580
and I need the name of
the facility for the report.

644
01:10:45,010 --> 01:10:48,460
Natalie Friedman.
F-R-I-E-D-M-A-N.

645
01:10:48,820 --> 01:10:51,621
Provider number, 11714.

646
01:10:54,341 --> 01:10:55,501
Cody Morgan.

647
01:12:37,475 --> 01:12:38,795
Where is he?

648
01:12:58,838 --> 01:12:59,638
Mommy.

649
01:15:21,658 --> 01:15:22,858
Cody?

650
01:17:00,911 --> 01:17:02,152
It keeps them safe.

651
01:17:03,912 --> 01:17:05,192
Until they grown up.

652
01:20:07,257 --> 01:20:08,457
let them go.

653
01:20:56,184 --> 01:20:57,184
Wait!

654
01:21:01,264 --> 01:21:02,665
I'm taking him home.

655
01:21:35,559 --> 01:21:36,829
This is for you.

656
01:21:38,710 --> 01:21:40,030
It's your mother's journal.

657
01:21:43,080 --> 01:21:46,831
Your mother's name was
Andrea Morgan.

658
01:21:47,961 --> 01:21:49,911
And I can tell by reading this,

659
01:21:50,311 --> 01:21:53,152
She loved you very, very much.

660
01:21:56,592 --> 01:21:59,592
When you were a baby,
she noticed you're a special.

661
01:22:08,654 --> 01:22:10,994
It was just the two of you
against the world.

662
01:22:15,155 --> 01:22:18,075
She writes a lot about you,
and about your gift.

663
01:22:18,635 --> 01:22:21,796
And how much she loved
watching you grow.

664
01:22:28,166 --> 01:22:31,197
I don't think she's stopped
writing because she didn't want to.

665
01:22:31,947 --> 01:22:33,877
I think it's because...

666
01:22:35,227 --> 01:22:36,718
She got sick.

667
01:22:39,678 --> 01:22:42,638
Which just happen sometimes.

668
01:22:48,599 --> 01:22:51,360
These are some of your
mother's test results.

669
01:22:53,360 --> 01:22:55,000
Do you see that word there?

670
01:22:56,720 --> 01:22:57,760
Canker.

671
01:23:00,241 --> 01:23:01,281
Not quite.

672
01:23:07,202 --> 01:23:11,882
It's difficult to explain
what cancer is to children.

673
01:23:12,362 --> 01:23:14,603
In terms they can understand.

674
01:23:17,963 --> 01:23:22,284
Your mother started to look
very different, very fast.

675
01:23:26,324 --> 01:23:29,435
And by the time she was
in the Intensive Care Unit,

676
01:23:29,665 --> 01:23:32,525
they started looking
a foster parents for you.

677
01:23:33,565 --> 01:23:37,886
But they would've brought you in
to see her one last time.

678
01:23:38,266 --> 01:23:39,406
To say goodbye.

679
01:23:53,808 --> 01:23:56,048
Her voice would've been
hard to hear.

680
01:23:56,759 --> 01:24:00,409
But I know she would've
tried to say, if she could.

681
01:24:00,649 --> 01:24:03,449
The one thing she would never
want you to forget.

682
01:24:04,130 --> 01:24:05,450
I...

683
01:24:06,610 --> 01:24:11,451
...am always with you.

684
01:24:14,211 --> 01:24:17,851
Once you got older,
you'd forget most of this.

685
01:24:18,692 --> 01:24:22,012
And you told people the
Canker ate your mommy.

686
01:24:23,812 --> 01:24:25,493
And as more time
went by...

687
01:24:26,133 --> 01:24:27,413
in your mind.

688
01:24:28,373 --> 01:24:33,094
The Canker Man ate my mom.

689
01:24:35,194 --> 01:24:37,454
Into your mind, Cody.

690
01:24:40,415 --> 01:24:44,455
Your amazing, special
one of kind mind,

691
01:24:44,975 --> 01:24:46,215
made him real.

692
01:24:48,616 --> 01:24:49,856
I'm so sorry.

693
01:24:51,056 --> 01:24:52,296
I'm so sorry.

694
01:24:54,376 --> 01:24:57,057
I used you, like I did for Sean.

695
01:25:00,897 --> 01:25:05,858
But I'll never do
that again, okay?

696
01:25:06,908 --> 01:25:07,968
Never.

697
01:25:12,569 --> 01:25:16,219
Here we go.
Here. Close to me, there.

698
01:25:17,620 --> 01:25:21,340
Remember, nothing
to worry about, okay?

699
01:25:22,460 --> 01:25:24,901
I'm going to be here
with you, all night.

700
01:25:25,821 --> 01:25:27,981
Will you tell me a bedtime story?

701
01:25:31,452 --> 01:25:32,582
Sure.

702
01:25:38,343 --> 01:25:40,063
Once upon a time...

703
01:25:41,453 --> 01:25:43,943
There was a special little boy...

704
01:25:44,943 --> 01:25:46,584
Who needed a mom.

705
01:25:48,784 --> 01:25:53,785
And there was a sad mom
she needed a son.

706
01:25:54,645 --> 01:25:56,865
Is this a happy story?

707
01:25:58,385 --> 01:25:59,425
I think it is.

708
01:26:01,186 --> 01:26:03,026
Has a happy ending, anyway.

709
01:26:03,586 --> 01:26:06,026
It feels like it can't.

710
01:26:06,906 --> 01:26:11,627
Because there was a people
going away.

711
01:26:13,687 --> 01:26:15,948
No one ever really goes away.

712
01:26:16,978 --> 01:26:18,188
Not completely.

713
01:26:19,628 --> 01:26:23,709
Because they live in our minds,
and in our hearts.

714
01:26:28,749 --> 01:26:30,150
In this story...

715
01:26:31,070 --> 01:26:33,830
That bully from school
woke up in his bed,

716
01:26:34,110 --> 01:26:35,830
like nothing ever happened.

717
01:26:37,151 --> 01:26:40,911
And whatever made him
so sad and mean, has gone.

718
01:26:43,631 --> 01:26:46,032
And that nice lady
who care for the boy,

719
01:26:46,672 --> 01:26:48,512
she came back to her hasbund,

720
01:26:49,032 --> 01:26:51,353
and they lived happily
ever after.

721
01:26:59,944 --> 01:27:01,394
And daddy...

722
01:27:06,275 --> 01:27:09,235
Daddy got the best present of all.

723
01:27:21,207 --> 01:27:23,277
Can those things happen?

724
01:27:27,117 --> 01:27:29,158
I guess that depends on you, Cody.

725
01:27:31,478 --> 01:27:33,438
You have an amazing gift.

726
01:27:36,879 --> 01:27:38,799
Who knows what can happen
as it grows?

727
01:27:40,239 --> 01:27:42,280
Thanks for bringing me home.

728
01:27:45,520 --> 01:27:46,560
Mom.
