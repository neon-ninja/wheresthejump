1
00:00:30,830 --> 00:00:35,404
<i>There's one word to describe
what's happening and that word is "panic."</i>

2
00:00:36,469 --> 00:00:39,814
<i>And of course this comes with
unthinkable irrational behavior.</i>

3
00:00:40,006 --> 00:00:42,748
<i>The crash
of '29, 1987's Black Monday,</i>

4
00:00:42,876 --> 00:00:45,618
<i>came with tragic
suicides and murders.</i>

5
00:00:45,979 --> 00:00:48,118
<i>This collapse is no exception.</i>

6
00:00:48,748 --> 00:00:51,490
<i>Just one hour ago,
as the markets were opening,</i>

7
00:00:51,551 --> 00:00:53,724
<i>two partners at
Capt Villiers Holdings</i>

8
00:00:53,787 --> 00:00:56,267
<i>were shot at the troubled
company's headquarters.</i>

9
00:00:56,322 --> 00:00:59,428
<i>Senior partner Laura
Mailer died on site</i>

10
00:00:59,492 --> 00:01:02,905
<i>and analyst Albert Bernad
is in critical condition.</i>

11
00:01:02,962 --> 00:01:05,738
<i>Jeffrey Desange,
also senior partner,</i>

12
00:01:05,799 --> 00:01:09,212
<i>was in the office at the time of the
shooting and has now gone missing.</i>

13
00:01:30,156 --> 00:01:33,330
Victoria... We...
We gotta go, sweetheart.

14
00:01:35,662 --> 00:01:36,834
That's it.

15
00:01:37,730 --> 00:01:39,835
Isn't Mommy
taking me to school?

16
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:42,677
Mommy's not feeling well.

17
00:01:44,737 --> 00:01:49,345
Put on your glasses.
Come on. Let's go.

18
00:02:05,658 --> 00:02:07,638
Daddy, where are we going?

19
00:02:10,029 --> 00:02:11,167
I don't know.

20
00:02:35,021 --> 00:02:36,056
Fuck!

21
00:02:38,525 --> 00:02:40,436
You're driving too fast!

22
00:02:53,673 --> 00:02:55,880
Daddy, you're driving too...

23
00:02:55,942 --> 00:02:56,977
Shut up!

24
00:03:23,169 --> 00:03:24,204
Sorry, excuse me.

25
00:03:25,805 --> 00:03:27,478
Whoa! Hey, buddy, you wanna
get behind the tape?

26
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:29,349
I'm family.
Lucas Desange.

27
00:03:29,409 --> 00:03:31,912
You called me, someone called
me, a detective or something.

28
00:03:31,978 --> 00:03:32,979
You live here?

29
00:03:33,079 --> 00:03:36,549
No, no, my brother lives here.
What's going on? Where's Jeff?

30
00:03:38,451 --> 00:03:39,759
Are the girls okay?
Where are the girls?

31
00:03:39,819 --> 00:03:42,390
Sir, just hang on, all right?
Just wait here.

32
00:03:42,455 --> 00:03:43,729
Oh, Jesus Christ!

33
00:03:51,397 --> 00:03:54,810
<i>...Jeffrey Desange apparently
shot two business partners to death</i>

34
00:03:54,867 --> 00:03:57,541
<i>before going onto
murder his estranged wife</i>

35
00:03:57,604 --> 00:04:00,778
<i>and kidnap his two daughters
aged three and one.</i>

36
00:04:08,314 --> 00:04:10,487
It's okay.
It's okay, come on.

37
00:04:11,384 --> 00:04:13,489
Daddy, are we there yet?

38
00:04:17,724 --> 00:04:19,226
My glasses are broken.

39
00:04:32,538 --> 00:04:33,608
What is it?

40
00:04:35,375 --> 00:04:37,412
This is okay. Yeah.

41
00:05:07,907 --> 00:05:08,942
Victoria, come here.

42
00:05:09,008 --> 00:05:10,248
There's someone inside.

43
00:05:11,044 --> 00:05:12,045
Now!

44
00:05:48,715 --> 00:05:50,991
Come on, come on.

45
00:06:32,892 --> 00:06:36,135
Daddy!
There's a woman outside.

46
00:06:39,766 --> 00:06:41,768
She's not touching the floor.

47
00:07:09,028 --> 00:07:10,268
Why are you crying?

48
00:07:11,764 --> 00:07:12,765
'Cause I'm sad, honey.

49
00:07:14,066 --> 00:07:15,374
Why are you sad?

50
00:07:16,803 --> 00:07:23,743
You know, moms and dads,
they try real hard,

51
00:07:25,077 --> 00:07:27,284
but sometimes
they mess things up.

52
00:07:29,916 --> 00:07:31,190
You know Daddy
loves you, right?

53
00:07:32,819 --> 00:07:33,820
Uh-huh.

54
00:07:36,422 --> 00:07:37,730
I can't see.

55
00:07:41,861 --> 00:07:42,862
What's that?

56
00:07:57,977 --> 00:07:58,978
Look, honey, a deer.

57
00:08:24,804 --> 00:08:25,805
Daddy?

58
00:08:29,308 --> 00:08:30,309
Daddy?

59
00:08:38,317 --> 00:08:42,561
Daddy? Daddy?

60
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:20,063
Look, Lilly, a cherry.

61
00:12:03,923 --> 00:12:04,924
Burnsie!

62
00:12:05,424 --> 00:12:06,596
So where are you guys today?

63
00:12:06,826 --> 00:12:12,276
Well, we're gonna have another
look around Sector 1-7-12-33.

64
00:12:12,898 --> 00:12:14,707
That's the mountain road, right?
Uh-huh.

65
00:12:15,434 --> 00:12:20,247
Gas station... Go up through the
Wilson Pass... It sounds good.

66
00:12:20,473 --> 00:12:22,043
Oh, God, I hate to do this.

67
00:12:22,508 --> 00:12:23,782
<i>Do what?</i>

68
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:26,256
Your last payment didn't clear.

69
00:12:27,113 --> 00:12:31,994
Well... I'll check on that. Don't
worry about it. The bank's screwing up.

70
00:12:33,853 --> 00:12:35,773
All right, I'll look into
it and get back to you.

71
00:12:37,156 --> 00:12:38,635
Thanks. Bye.

72
00:12:39,792 --> 00:12:43,137
Thank you, God. Sweet!

73
00:12:44,096 --> 00:12:45,439
That Burnsie on the phone?

74
00:12:45,498 --> 00:12:46,738
Yup.

75
00:12:46,799 --> 00:12:53,011
What's his next move? Is he going to
search sector plural-Z-alpha?

76
00:12:54,974 --> 00:12:56,578
Hey, guess who's not pregnant?

77
00:12:58,444 --> 00:13:00,117
What is wrong with you?

78
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:05,053
The last payment didn't clear.

79
00:13:09,755 --> 00:13:11,860
So there's a problem
with the bank or...

80
00:13:11,991 --> 00:13:13,061
The money's gone.

81
00:13:13,826 --> 00:13:14,827
I pick "B".

82
00:13:15,628 --> 00:13:17,164
That is the correct answer.

83
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:22,946
Hey, look, babe.
It's your brother.

84
00:13:23,002 --> 00:13:26,540
You wanna spend all your money trying
to find him, it's okay with me.

85
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:28,676
It's cheaper than therapy.

86
00:13:29,108 --> 00:13:30,246
And so am I.

87
00:13:30,309 --> 00:13:31,310
Whoa!

88
00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:46,392
I need to go.
Mmm-hmm.

89
00:13:59,572 --> 00:14:00,573
Burnsie!

90
00:14:01,674 --> 00:14:02,675
What?

91
00:14:03,375 --> 00:14:04,752
Hey, Burnsie!

92
00:14:05,344 --> 00:14:06,618
Jesus Christ!

93
00:14:12,651 --> 00:14:14,062
We gonna call him?

94
00:14:14,119 --> 00:14:15,723
Just give me a minute.

95
00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:18,327
Well, we should call!
We said we'd call.

96
00:14:18,390 --> 00:14:23,567
Ronnie, shut up
just for one minute.

97
00:14:30,703 --> 00:14:32,740
Here you go,
Bird, take a whiff of that.

98
00:15:10,809 --> 00:15:11,947
Hello!

99
00:15:31,263 --> 00:15:32,298
Uh-huh.

100
00:15:32,364 --> 00:15:34,810
Yes, sir. Yes, sir,
yes, sir, yes, sir.

101
00:16:05,464 --> 00:16:06,966
It's cherry pits.

102
00:16:29,254 --> 00:16:30,460
Hey, Burnsie!

103
00:16:59,284 --> 00:17:02,322
Burnsie, can we call him now?

104
00:17:27,646 --> 00:17:28,852
They found them.

105
00:17:29,381 --> 00:17:30,451
You're shitting me.

106
00:17:30,783 --> 00:17:33,320
They found the girls, alive.

107
00:17:40,993 --> 00:17:43,496
Dr. Gerald Dreyfuss,
and you must be Annabel.

108
00:17:43,562 --> 00:17:44,768
I must be.

109
00:17:45,497 --> 00:17:46,635
Lucas.
How are they?

110
00:17:47,933 --> 00:17:50,914
Well, just let me warn you,
this won't be easy.

111
00:17:53,605 --> 00:17:55,846
We're very fortunate
that Victoria was

112
00:17:55,974 --> 00:17:58,250
old enough to retain
much of her vocabulary.

113
00:17:58,310 --> 00:18:00,916
But it's still too early to determine
if her social development...

114
00:18:00,979 --> 00:18:02,390
What about the other one?

115
00:18:03,649 --> 00:18:04,821
That's a different story.

116
00:18:18,197 --> 00:18:19,335
Jesus.

117
00:18:25,137 --> 00:18:26,172
Oh, yeah.

118
00:18:30,809 --> 00:18:32,550
Hey, Victoria.

119
00:18:44,623 --> 00:18:47,331
Is that you, Lilly? Hey!

120
00:18:50,863 --> 00:18:52,900
No, no, no.
It's okay, it's okay.

121
00:18:55,467 --> 00:18:57,003
I'm not gonna hurt you.

122
00:18:58,370 --> 00:18:59,542
Hey...

123
00:19:01,306 --> 00:19:02,614
It's okay, it's okay.

124
00:19:07,045 --> 00:19:10,288
<i>I got something for you,
for your eyes.</i>

125
00:19:11,617 --> 00:19:16,760
When you were a little girl, you had
a pair of these. Do you remember?

126
00:19:18,957 --> 00:19:23,406
I'm just gonna put... That's okay.
I'm just gonna put them here.

127
00:19:31,837 --> 00:19:33,043
It's okay.

128
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:41,385
Yeah.

129
00:19:45,617 --> 00:19:46,960
That's it.

130
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:09,346
Daddy?

131
00:20:12,110 --> 00:20:17,685
No, no, honey. Honey, no. I'm...
I'm not your daddy, I'm...

132
00:20:19,084 --> 00:20:22,861
I'm your daddy's brother.
Remember? Uncle Luke?

133
00:20:30,762 --> 00:20:31,934
Dad?

134
00:20:34,333 --> 00:20:35,505
Oh...

135
00:20:39,671 --> 00:20:41,344
It's okay.

136
00:20:41,406 --> 00:20:42,510
Dad?

137
00:20:42,574 --> 00:20:44,076
It's okay.

138
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:57,730
Dr. Gerald Dreyfuss,
Your Honor.

139
00:20:57,789 --> 00:20:59,860
The girls have been in
my care at the Institute

140
00:20:59,992 --> 00:21:02,029
since they were
found 87 days ago.

141
00:21:02,094 --> 00:21:04,199
And how would you
define their progress?

142
00:21:04,763 --> 00:21:09,678
Solid, and astoundingly fast.
If I may?

143
00:21:13,905 --> 00:21:16,146
Your Honor,
Victoria and Lilly Desange

144
00:21:16,275 --> 00:21:18,551
were found in
deplorable conditions,

145
00:21:19,244 --> 00:21:24,557
isolated, starved. They feared and
distrusted all physical contact.

146
00:21:25,083 --> 00:21:29,828
Their emotional growth was clearly
compromised by their abandonment.

147
00:21:29,888 --> 00:21:32,232
In order to survive
such extreme isolation,

148
00:21:32,357 --> 00:21:34,735
the girls created
an imaginary guardian,

149
00:21:35,661 --> 00:21:39,336
a parent figure to feed them,
sing to them, protect them.

150
00:21:40,766 --> 00:21:42,746
They called her "Mama."

151
00:21:45,103 --> 00:21:48,414
Victoria and Lilly have a real
chance at a normal life now.

152
00:21:49,041 --> 00:21:51,715
With the right care, physical
and emotional development,

153
00:21:51,777 --> 00:21:55,657
and much-needed love and
affection, they will get better.

154
00:21:55,714 --> 00:21:57,557
Thank you, Dr. Dreyfuss.

155
00:21:57,616 --> 00:22:00,893
Miss Podolski, would you
care to address the court?

156
00:22:00,952 --> 00:22:01,952
Good morning, Your Honor.

157
00:22:02,187 --> 00:22:04,428
Jeffrey Desange
murdered my niece

158
00:22:04,556 --> 00:22:06,797
and abandoned his
daughters in the forest.

159
00:22:06,858 --> 00:22:09,099
Now, his brother did
an extraordinary thing.

160
00:22:09,227 --> 00:22:11,537
Lucas never gave
up on his nieces,

161
00:22:11,797 --> 00:22:14,277
but he did it for the girls,
not for himself.

162
00:22:14,399 --> 00:22:16,879
So if he still has their
best interest at heart,

163
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:20,180
he must know that neither his
salary nor his very small apartment

164
00:22:20,238 --> 00:22:22,377
are suitable for
the raising of two children,

165
00:22:22,441 --> 00:22:24,682
let alone two children
with very special needs.

166
00:22:24,743 --> 00:22:26,143
How many kids have
you raised, Jean?

167
00:22:26,144 --> 00:22:27,589
About as many as you, Lucas.

168
00:22:29,581 --> 00:22:31,021
Of course she wants
the girls, Lucas.

169
00:22:31,116 --> 00:22:32,527
Stand in her shoes
for a second.

170
00:22:32,617 --> 00:22:36,064
She can't just sweep in and take them.
They're not hers to take.

171
00:22:36,722 --> 00:22:38,065
I'm not sure
that's entirely fair.

172
00:22:38,123 --> 00:22:41,730
I'll tell you what's not fair. It's not
fair that she gets to buy my nieces.

173
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:43,764
Would it really be
such a bad thing?

174
00:22:43,829 --> 00:22:45,035
What?

175
00:22:46,465 --> 00:22:50,470
Annabel plays in a band. You
draw pictures for a living.

176
00:22:50,535 --> 00:22:54,244
The way you live, do you have
room for children in your life?

177
00:22:54,306 --> 00:22:55,376
I mean, really?

178
00:22:56,441 --> 00:22:57,681
What are you saying, Gerald?

179
00:22:59,711 --> 00:23:01,850
When it comes to
the girls' welfare,

180
00:23:01,913 --> 00:23:05,360
the family court judge is pretty much
obliged to act on my recommendation.

181
00:23:05,417 --> 00:23:08,159
And right now, I'd be
lying if I didn't say

182
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:10,530
it was a slam dunk
for Miss Podolski.

183
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:13,301
But the truth is,

184
00:23:14,393 --> 00:23:16,134
I don't want them living on
the other side of the country

185
00:23:16,194 --> 00:23:17,730
any more than you do.

186
00:23:18,430 --> 00:23:22,845
So, we can really, really help
each other out right now.

187
00:23:24,369 --> 00:23:27,907
You want the girls, I need
continued access to them.

188
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:30,783
What do we gotta do?

189
00:23:36,348 --> 00:23:40,228
This house, courtesy of the
Institute, is used for case studies.

190
00:23:40,285 --> 00:23:44,461
Rent free. You move to the
house, you get the girls.

191
00:23:45,390 --> 00:23:47,461
This is a joke, right?

192
00:23:53,465 --> 00:23:55,103
Mr. Desange,
is your brother still alive?

193
00:23:55,167 --> 00:23:56,968
Has your brother contacted you?

194
00:23:58,970 --> 00:24:00,677
Oh, son of a bitch.

195
00:24:01,973 --> 00:24:03,077
Look, Jean...

196
00:24:03,141 --> 00:24:07,021
No. I just want to
see them, that's all.

197
00:24:07,078 --> 00:24:09,490
You'll see them, I mean,
you've got visitation rights,

198
00:24:09,548 --> 00:24:13,621
we respect that, but right
now, we need a little space.

199
00:24:13,685 --> 00:24:16,564
Just work on this thing for a while.
Find our feet.

200
00:24:19,357 --> 00:24:20,529
Okay?

201
00:24:20,592 --> 00:24:21,798
Excuse me.

202
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:24,033
<i>October 26th.</i>

203
00:24:24,095 --> 00:24:26,097
Although she
seems collaborative

204
00:24:26,231 --> 00:24:28,268
and is quickly recovering
her language skills,

205
00:24:29,501 --> 00:24:31,879
<i>Victoria may be
repressing the memory</i>

206
00:24:32,003 --> 00:24:34,381
<i>of her experience
in the wilderness.</i>

207
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:38,785
Okay, Victoria,
are you nice and relaxed?

208
00:24:40,278 --> 00:24:42,451
Are you feeling sleepy?

209
00:24:43,548 --> 00:24:48,588
I want you to tell me the story again.
Can you tell me the story?

210
00:24:52,924 --> 00:24:54,733
It was a long time ago.

211
00:24:54,793 --> 00:24:57,296
A lady ran away from a
hospital for sad people.

212
00:24:59,598 --> 00:25:03,375
She took her baby.
They jumped into the water.

213
00:25:05,103 --> 00:25:07,379
How could you know
that story, Victoria?

214
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:10,879
Did Mama tell you that story?

215
00:25:11,176 --> 00:25:12,382
She showed me.

216
00:25:12,444 --> 00:25:13,684
How?

217
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:16,186
In a dream.

218
00:25:17,115 --> 00:25:18,788
Go on, Victoria.

219
00:25:27,526 --> 00:25:29,836
And you can't tell
anyone where you are?

220
00:25:30,495 --> 00:25:31,701
Nope.

221
00:25:32,063 --> 00:25:33,565
That's just bizarre, dude.

222
00:25:33,965 --> 00:25:37,071
Yeah, well, it's for the
girls, to keep the press away.

223
00:25:38,670 --> 00:25:40,047
It's so messed up, though.

224
00:25:40,305 --> 00:25:42,114
All families are messed up.

225
00:25:42,507 --> 00:25:44,680
Yeah, but this one's
messed up and instant.

226
00:25:45,844 --> 00:25:47,585
Heck, I didn't even
have the chance

227
00:25:47,712 --> 00:25:49,487
to screw 'em up,
they came that way.

228
00:25:50,415 --> 00:25:51,553
Leave him.

229
00:25:51,616 --> 00:25:52,788
Can't.

230
00:25:53,118 --> 00:25:55,029
You didn't sign
up for this, babe.

231
00:25:57,455 --> 00:25:58,729
I can't do that to him.

232
00:25:59,190 --> 00:26:02,603
Mrs. Sensitivity.
You are in a rock band.

233
00:26:05,096 --> 00:26:07,098
I was in a rock band, yeah.

234
00:26:50,909 --> 00:26:52,013
Hey, girls.

235
00:26:56,548 --> 00:26:58,926
Hey, come here.

236
00:27:01,019 --> 00:27:02,191
Mama.

237
00:27:02,354 --> 00:27:04,197
No, don't call me that,
I'm not your mom.

238
00:27:04,322 --> 00:27:06,165
I'm Annabel,
you can call me that.

239
00:27:07,492 --> 00:27:09,836
Or Annie or whatever you like.

240
00:27:13,798 --> 00:27:17,075
We could... We could work
it out together, right?

241
00:27:20,038 --> 00:27:21,073
Mama.

242
00:28:00,011 --> 00:28:01,149
Handsome?

243
00:29:33,671 --> 00:29:37,983
There are no police reports
between 2008 and 2012

244
00:29:38,042 --> 00:29:40,818
that match your patient's story.
And Doctor,

245
00:29:40,879 --> 00:29:43,792
there are no psychiatric hospitals
anywhere near Clifton Forge.

246
00:29:45,817 --> 00:29:47,057
Where would the closest one be?

247
00:29:47,385 --> 00:29:49,296
Falls Church,
200 miles from here.

248
00:29:52,056 --> 00:29:54,798
Now this logbook
contains records from

249
00:29:54,926 --> 00:29:57,702
St. Gertrude's Asylum,
up by Douthat Lake.

250
00:29:57,762 --> 00:29:59,605
That's 5 miles north from here.

251
00:30:00,064 --> 00:30:01,600
But you told me that there were

252
00:30:01,733 --> 00:30:03,303
no mental hospitals
in the area.

253
00:30:03,635 --> 00:30:08,243
There aren't. St. Gertrude's
shut down in 1878.

254
00:30:11,142 --> 00:30:14,680
Page 31, patient Edith Brennan.

255
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:30,492
Annabel?

256
00:31:30,555 --> 00:31:31,625
Yep?

257
00:31:31,689 --> 00:31:32,895
Handsome's outside.

258
00:31:33,524 --> 00:31:35,333
It's all right,
I put him there.

259
00:31:35,793 --> 00:31:37,295
But, he's crying.

260
00:31:43,668 --> 00:31:44,874
Awesome.

261
00:33:01,579 --> 00:33:04,116
<i>There's no way these
kids are ready for this.</i>

262
00:33:04,983 --> 00:33:07,896
Babe, I know it's tough.
It'll get better, I promise.

263
00:33:07,952 --> 00:33:09,158
I don't know if I
can do this, Luke.

264
00:33:09,220 --> 00:33:11,530
Hey, I love you, girl.

265
00:33:34,779 --> 00:33:36,588
Oh, my God! Someone's here!

266
00:33:37,815 --> 00:33:41,729
What? Victoria? Lilly?

267
00:34:26,197 --> 00:34:27,437
No one's here.

268
00:34:27,498 --> 00:34:29,603
Someone's here.
I saw them.

269
00:34:29,667 --> 00:34:30,839
What, whoa, whoa, whoa,
honey, honey!

270
00:34:30,968 --> 00:34:32,140
I saw them!

271
00:34:32,203 --> 00:34:34,183
Give me the hammer.
Give me the hammer!

272
00:34:34,305 --> 00:34:36,307
I'll check downstairs,
you look after the girls.

273
00:35:48,813 --> 00:35:55,423
Lucas? Lucas?
Oh, my God! Lucas!

274
00:35:55,686 --> 00:35:57,996
<i>Hi, it's Vince with Slap Chop.
You can be the...</i>

275
00:36:02,059 --> 00:36:04,369
Chop, chop, chop. Chop, chop.

276
00:36:14,071 --> 00:36:16,108
I'm really sorry, Annabel.

277
00:36:18,376 --> 00:36:20,856
But they told me he
responded well to the tests

278
00:36:20,912 --> 00:36:23,620
and it's very likely
this coma's temporary.

279
00:36:24,315 --> 00:36:25,658
What happens now?

280
00:36:26,951 --> 00:36:28,726
I'm afraid I don't follow.

281
00:36:29,554 --> 00:36:31,727
The girls. Now that Lucas is not...
The girls.

282
00:36:31,989 --> 00:36:36,199
Annabel, the girls need you. They
need security, predictability.

283
00:36:36,694 --> 00:36:40,369
But I'm not prepared for this, I can't do this alone.
This isn't my job to do.

284
00:36:40,464 --> 00:36:42,501
Just grow up. If you
don't, you'll lose custody

285
00:36:42,567 --> 00:36:43,978
and Lucas will be
lucky if he sees

286
00:36:44,101 --> 00:36:45,541
his nieces every
second Thanksgiving.

287
00:36:54,045 --> 00:36:56,753
Well, all checked out. All the
doors and windows were locked,

288
00:36:56,814 --> 00:36:59,090
no evidence of an intruder,
nothing stolen, so...

289
00:36:59,150 --> 00:37:02,324
So I imagined it then, yeah?
All right, thank you, bud.

290
00:37:03,321 --> 00:37:04,595
Ma'am.

291
00:37:05,389 --> 00:37:06,868
Richmond's finest.

292
00:37:10,461 --> 00:37:13,465
Okay, guys,
just you and me for a while.

293
00:37:14,198 --> 00:37:19,477
I don't know how you're feeling about
that, but we don't got a choice.

294
00:38:33,010 --> 00:38:35,115
How have they been
affected by all of this?

295
00:38:35,179 --> 00:38:37,022
They are talking to the walls.

296
00:38:38,816 --> 00:38:40,227
What do they say?

297
00:38:41,419 --> 00:38:42,727
Mama.

298
00:38:57,268 --> 00:38:58,611
What is this?

299
00:39:00,638 --> 00:39:02,208
They made that.

300
00:39:12,650 --> 00:39:17,998
<i>They found a doll in the
cabin, Victoria. Who made the doll?</i>

301
00:39:20,925 --> 00:39:22,097
<i>Mama.</i>

302
00:39:23,594 --> 00:39:27,371
<i>The doll's called
"Mama," or Mama made the doll?</i>

303
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,240
<i>Mama made the doll.</i>

304
00:39:31,302 --> 00:39:32,872
<i>And who is Mama?</i>

305
00:39:34,739 --> 00:39:36,514
<i>Are you "Mama", Victoria?</i>

306
00:40:01,198 --> 00:40:04,543
<i>- This is Dr. Gerald Dreyfuss.
- Please leave a message.</i>

307
00:40:04,602 --> 00:40:08,982
<i>Dr. Dreyfuss, this is Louise
from Clifton Forge Public Records.</i>

308
00:40:09,039 --> 00:40:12,043
<i>Hound something that
you will want to see.</i>

309
00:40:30,795 --> 00:40:31,830
You guys okay?

310
00:40:49,246 --> 00:40:50,281
What's so funny?

311
00:41:10,601 --> 00:41:11,602
Good night.

312
00:41:12,403 --> 00:41:13,404
No!

313
00:41:16,073 --> 00:41:17,074
Whatever.

314
00:41:22,646 --> 00:41:24,216
Nice butt, Bruce.

315
00:41:59,783 --> 00:42:03,128
Victoria! Come. Mama.

316
00:43:14,925 --> 00:43:16,268
You guys know what time it is?

317
00:43:19,229 --> 00:43:22,210
I guess you wouldn't. It's late,
it's really, really late.

318
00:43:36,547 --> 00:43:37,582
Don't.

319
00:43:41,685 --> 00:43:42,686
Don't what?

320
00:43:43,253 --> 00:43:44,732
Don't go in the closet.

321
00:43:48,759 --> 00:43:50,500
Why not?
What's in the closet?

322
00:43:54,865 --> 00:43:56,276
Nothing.

323
00:44:20,190 --> 00:44:22,397
Okay.
It's been a long day

324
00:44:22,459 --> 00:44:24,496
so you guys should
get some sleep. Go to bed.

325
00:44:28,766 --> 00:44:30,677
You want me to
leave the door open?

326
00:44:35,239 --> 00:44:36,240
Night.

327
00:44:43,814 --> 00:44:45,020
Just tell me about it.

328
00:44:47,885 --> 00:44:49,421
I think someone's
coming to visit them.

329
00:44:49,753 --> 00:44:50,754
Who?

330
00:44:51,221 --> 00:44:52,393
I don't know.

331
00:44:53,691 --> 00:44:54,726
And you believe that?

332
00:44:55,159 --> 00:44:56,502
I heard her.

333
00:44:56,560 --> 00:45:00,372
She was singing to them, it was
like a lullaby or something.

334
00:45:00,431 --> 00:45:03,969
You heard her?
Definitely a her?

335
00:45:04,334 --> 00:45:05,404
Yeah.

336
00:45:07,638 --> 00:45:08,844
Sound like this?

337
00:45:24,722 --> 00:45:28,363
Yeah, but it was... It was different.
Her voice was deeper.

338
00:45:30,327 --> 00:45:35,037
Victoria is showing signs of a
dissociative personality disorder.

339
00:45:35,699 --> 00:45:39,306
I think she could be taking on the role of Mama.
Literally becoming her.

340
00:45:40,037 --> 00:45:41,812
It's treatable,
with time and patience.

341
00:45:43,373 --> 00:45:44,852
Am I safe?

342
00:45:44,908 --> 00:45:48,720
What, from a crazy eight year old?
Give me a break.

343
00:46:07,231 --> 00:46:09,734
I found a second entry
under the name of that woman.

344
00:46:09,833 --> 00:46:11,073
Edith Brennan?

345
00:46:11,368 --> 00:46:12,870
Mad Edith Brennan.

346
00:46:14,004 --> 00:46:16,280
Welcome to Aisle 17, Doctor.

347
00:46:16,340 --> 00:46:18,877
Every archive has one,
the lost-and-found

348
00:46:19,009 --> 00:46:21,546
of things people
don't want to find.

349
00:46:22,379 --> 00:46:26,418
Twenty years ago, when they moved
the Clifton Forge cemetery,

350
00:46:26,483 --> 00:46:29,020
some of the oldest,
smallest remains

351
00:46:29,153 --> 00:46:31,759
were not claimed
by their relatives.

352
00:46:31,822 --> 00:46:33,699
They were sent
here to be filed.

353
00:46:34,491 --> 00:46:37,131
I'm not a religious person,
but I do believe

354
00:46:37,261 --> 00:46:39,901
there's a place
for human remains,

355
00:46:39,963 --> 00:46:43,501
and it's not on a shelf
in a government building.

356
00:46:54,912 --> 00:46:56,357
Do you believe in ghosts?

357
00:46:57,181 --> 00:46:58,455
I can't say that I do.

358
00:47:00,284 --> 00:47:06,098
When a corpse is left out, the
elements wither it, desiccate it,

359
00:47:06,990 --> 00:47:09,266
twisting it into
a distorted figure

360
00:47:09,393 --> 00:47:11,703
that is barely recognizable
as a human being.

361
00:47:12,663 --> 00:47:15,166
A ghost is an emotion
bent out of shape,

362
00:47:15,966 --> 00:47:20,108
condemned to repeat itself,
time and time again,

363
00:47:21,004 --> 00:47:23,814
until it rights
the wrong that was done.

364
00:47:30,514 --> 00:47:31,822
What's this?

365
00:47:32,249 --> 00:47:33,592
The wrong.

366
00:49:58,729 --> 00:49:59,764
Jeff?

367
00:50:00,063 --> 00:50:01,906
Save my girls.

368
00:50:06,236 --> 00:50:08,011
Go to the cabin.

369
00:50:21,685 --> 00:50:22,720
Code Blue!

370
00:50:22,853 --> 00:50:23,974
He's seizing.
Hold him still.

371
00:50:24,955 --> 00:50:26,434
Lorazepam, 4 milligrams.

372
00:50:26,490 --> 00:50:28,265
Four milligrams of Lorazepam.

373
00:50:28,325 --> 00:50:29,599
Is the line going?
It is.

374
00:50:29,659 --> 00:50:31,195
Fever?
No fever, Doctor.

375
00:50:31,261 --> 00:50:33,070
Mr. Desange,
can you hear me?

376
00:50:33,130 --> 00:50:34,734
It's okay, Mr. Desange.

377
00:50:44,808 --> 00:50:48,221
You kick me off the bed,
I check on the girls.

378
00:50:48,278 --> 00:50:50,280
That's about as
much as I remember.

379
00:50:50,414 --> 00:50:52,416
For all I know,
it was you who pushed me.

380
00:50:52,482 --> 00:50:54,484
Uh-uh.
I would have finished the job.

381
00:50:58,889 --> 00:51:00,300
Oh, you drew me a picture!

382
00:51:01,258 --> 00:51:02,362
It's a raccoon.

383
00:51:03,660 --> 00:51:07,107
Thank you. I drew something
for you guys, too.

384
00:51:08,965 --> 00:51:12,037
There you go.
You like it?

385
00:51:12,602 --> 00:51:13,637
Yes.

386
00:51:14,271 --> 00:51:19,778
That's cute. So, how was it? Was
it a tunnel with a light at the end?

387
00:51:20,310 --> 00:51:24,383
Oh, yeah, yeah. It was beautiful. I
was so not staying away from the light.

388
00:51:24,448 --> 00:51:25,552
Ha, ha, ha.

389
00:51:27,284 --> 00:51:30,163
So how's it been,
life as a single mom?

390
00:51:30,954 --> 00:51:32,126
It's great!
Yeah?

391
00:51:32,689 --> 00:51:34,362
It's terrible.
They hate me.

392
00:51:34,458 --> 00:51:35,459
They don't hate you.

393
00:51:35,559 --> 00:51:37,505
They hate me.
They don't hate you.

394
00:51:37,928 --> 00:51:40,499
So easy for you to say.
You're like the cool uncle.

395
00:51:40,564 --> 00:51:42,237
I am the cool uncle.

396
00:51:45,435 --> 00:51:47,278
What? What is it, Annie?

397
00:51:48,438 --> 00:51:49,644
Just get well soon
so you can come home

398
00:51:49,706 --> 00:51:50,946
and clean up
their mess, please.

399
00:51:52,008 --> 00:51:53,282
You sure that's it?

400
00:51:54,978 --> 00:51:56,286
Yeah.

401
00:52:05,989 --> 00:52:07,195
You okay?

402
00:52:12,929 --> 00:52:15,102
What are you doing in here?

403
00:52:16,633 --> 00:52:18,840
Here. I'll help.

404
00:52:25,342 --> 00:52:26,252
What is it?

405
00:52:27,043 --> 00:52:28,613
I don't want you to get hurt.

406
00:52:29,212 --> 00:52:30,520
What do you mean?

407
00:52:32,315 --> 00:52:35,159
I'm fine. Nothing bad's
gonna happen to me.

408
00:52:35,218 --> 00:52:36,720
You can't do that!

409
00:52:37,154 --> 00:52:38,189
Why?

410
00:52:38,622 --> 00:52:40,101
'Cause she gets jealous.

411
00:52:54,371 --> 00:52:55,406
Hey, wait!

412
00:52:58,708 --> 00:52:59,846
What's wrong with you?

413
00:53:07,017 --> 00:53:08,155
Oh!

414
00:53:08,218 --> 00:53:10,994
Hey, Jean. Um...
How can I help?

415
00:53:12,656 --> 00:53:13,691
It's my day.

416
00:53:14,624 --> 00:53:16,264
Are you sure? I thought
that was Thursday.

417
00:53:16,893 --> 00:53:18,201
It is Thursday.

418
00:53:18,495 --> 00:53:19,769
Sorry about the mess.

419
00:53:19,829 --> 00:53:23,641
Children make mess. That's how it works.
How are they?

420
00:53:23,700 --> 00:53:25,907
Outdoorsy.
You want coffee?

421
00:53:25,969 --> 00:53:27,175
Thank you.

422
00:53:30,340 --> 00:53:32,946
Oh, my God.
What is this?

423
00:53:33,977 --> 00:53:36,082
Yeah, I know,
they're wild sometimes.

424
00:53:36,146 --> 00:53:37,386
It's not an excuse.

425
00:53:39,015 --> 00:53:42,121
Hey, now. They're bruises.
Kids get bruised.

426
00:53:42,185 --> 00:53:43,323
This bruised?

427
00:53:43,420 --> 00:53:45,093
It's not like that.

428
00:53:46,590 --> 00:53:47,660
Let me have them.

429
00:53:47,857 --> 00:53:48,892
Sorry?

430
00:53:48,959 --> 00:53:50,029
Just for a few days.

431
00:53:50,093 --> 00:53:54,132
You can, I don't know,
play with your band,

432
00:53:54,331 --> 00:53:56,675
have a drink with
your friends...

433
00:53:57,934 --> 00:54:00,813
Jean, I think it's great

434
00:54:00,870 --> 00:54:02,178
that the girls have a
relationship with their aunt,

435
00:54:02,239 --> 00:54:04,549
I really, really do,
but right now,

436
00:54:04,608 --> 00:54:06,918
you need to get out of my
house before I kick your ass.

437
00:54:14,551 --> 00:54:16,189
I'll see you both
real soon, okay?

438
00:54:18,154 --> 00:54:19,360
Hey!

439
00:54:21,725 --> 00:54:23,136
Have you been
coming around here?

440
00:54:23,193 --> 00:54:24,365
I beg your pardon?

441
00:54:24,427 --> 00:54:26,236
You been coming to the house,
playing with the girls?

442
00:54:26,296 --> 00:54:27,570
Of course not. Why?

443
00:54:29,933 --> 00:54:31,139
Doesn't matter.

444
00:54:35,272 --> 00:54:38,617
<i>Richmond.
Social Services.</i>

445
00:54:38,875 --> 00:54:40,081
Uh...

446
00:54:40,210 --> 00:54:43,783
Who should I speak to if I believe
my nieces are being abused?

447
00:54:46,950 --> 00:54:51,626
Well, what kind of evidence
do I need exactly?

448
00:54:52,822 --> 00:54:54,392
How the hell did you forget?

449
00:54:54,457 --> 00:54:56,095
<i>Are you kidding me?</i>

450
00:54:56,159 --> 00:54:58,662
You know she wants
to take the girls from us!

451
00:54:58,728 --> 00:55:01,937
I'm exhausted, I'm sorry,
I forgot today was her day.

452
00:55:02,232 --> 00:55:06,647
Jesus Christ, Annie, it's one
visit, it's not much to remember.

453
00:55:07,971 --> 00:55:10,383
Annie, listen, they’re just
kids, all you got to do is...

454
00:55:10,440 --> 00:55:12,386
What? Chill out?
Take it easy?

455
00:55:12,442 --> 00:55:16,083
You know, I can't do this, this is not my job.
This is your job.

456
00:55:16,146 --> 00:55:18,752
I am out of here in a day, just
hold it together until then.

457
00:55:18,815 --> 00:55:20,726
All right, fine, yeah,
we'll see what happens then.

458
00:55:20,784 --> 00:55:22,627
I'll take care them,
those girls are

459
00:55:22,752 --> 00:55:24,595
the most important
thing in the world to me.

460
00:55:27,290 --> 00:55:28,997
Awesome.
Annie, you...

461
00:55:42,339 --> 00:55:45,912
Okay, Victoria,
are you nice and relaxed?

462
00:55:47,811 --> 00:55:49,552
Are you feeling sleepy?

463
00:55:53,883 --> 00:55:55,590
I'd like you to
tell me about Mama.

464
00:55:58,154 --> 00:55:59,997
Did she live in
that house with you?

465
00:56:02,058 --> 00:56:03,935
The house by that lake?

466
00:56:08,832 --> 00:56:10,505
Where did she live?

467
00:56:16,506 --> 00:56:17,712
In the walls.

468
00:56:20,677 --> 00:56:22,179
Where is she now?

469
00:56:26,316 --> 00:56:27,795
I don't know.

470
00:56:29,085 --> 00:56:32,225
I think you know.
I think you know where she is.

471
00:56:36,593 --> 00:56:41,667
Where is she, Victoria?
Is she here in this house?

472
00:56:41,998 --> 00:56:43,204
Did she come with you?

473
00:56:46,403 --> 00:56:47,643
Open your eyes, Victoria.

474
00:56:50,206 --> 00:56:52,584
Look at this photograph.
Is this Mama?

475
00:56:54,310 --> 00:56:55,448
Is this Mama, Victoria?

476
00:56:55,545 --> 00:56:57,024
Go away!
Tell me about her!

477
00:56:57,080 --> 00:56:58,184
No!
Yes!

478
00:57:25,375 --> 00:57:26,581
What's going on?

479
00:57:27,010 --> 00:57:28,614
Nothing, nothing's going on.

480
00:57:28,678 --> 00:57:29,884
Gerald, what happened?

481
00:57:30,246 --> 00:57:32,283
I have to go.
I'll call you.

482
00:57:48,698 --> 00:57:49,768
<i>November 3rd.</i>

483
00:57:52,202 --> 00:57:54,204
<i>The seventh session
was more than revealing.</i>

484
00:57:55,538 --> 00:57:57,415
<i>I think I have found a door,</i>

485
00:57:57,474 --> 00:58:01,388
<i>a passage, that connects Helvetia
and the Desange's house.</i>

486
00:58:04,981 --> 00:58:07,825
<i>There is no rational explanation
that supports this theory,</i>

487
00:58:08,418 --> 00:58:12,366
<i>but it is only the ability
to embrace a different reality</i>

488
00:58:12,455 --> 00:58:15,800
<i>that makes science expand beyond
the limits of what we know.</i>

489
00:58:22,799 --> 00:58:27,441
<i>However, extraordinary claims
require extraordinary proof.</i>

490
00:58:28,638 --> 00:58:31,949
<i>I now feel closer than ever to
the real subject of my research.</i>

491
00:58:32,876 --> 00:58:37,018
<i>I will come back from Clifton
Forge with an answer.</i>

492
01:00:50,613 --> 01:00:51,785
What's wrong?

493
01:01:01,658 --> 01:01:06,539
What's under the bed?
Victoria?

494
01:02:12,729 --> 01:02:16,040
Victoria! Come! Mama!

495
01:02:26,876 --> 01:02:29,652
Victoria! Come! Mama!

496
01:02:37,920 --> 01:02:39,263
Victoria stay.

497
01:03:13,556 --> 01:03:14,728
Mama?

498
01:03:18,127 --> 01:03:19,435
Where Mama?

499
01:03:58,634 --> 01:03:59,942
I know your name.

500
01:04:02,939 --> 01:04:04,179
I know what you want.

501
01:05:12,575 --> 01:05:13,747
Lilly!

502
01:05:15,745 --> 01:05:19,056
Lilly, Lilly, are you okay?

503
01:05:19,982 --> 01:05:21,154
How did you get down here?

504
01:05:24,487 --> 01:05:27,798
You're shitting me. Are you shitting me?
Come here, crazy!

505
01:05:31,394 --> 01:05:32,634
Okay.

506
01:05:39,669 --> 01:05:42,309
Stop!
Stop it!

507
01:05:51,480 --> 01:05:52,720
Stop!

508
01:05:57,653 --> 01:05:59,690
It's okay. Come on.

509
01:06:00,389 --> 01:06:05,236
Come on, come on,
come on, now...

510
01:06:09,565 --> 01:06:11,567
Okay. Come here.

511
01:06:27,883 --> 01:06:28,953
What?

512
01:06:34,657 --> 01:06:35,829
You like that?

513
01:06:52,675 --> 01:06:53,847
Okay!

514
01:07:13,496 --> 01:07:16,602
Okay, door is good,
window is bad.

515
01:07:16,665 --> 01:07:19,009
So if we want to go outside,
what do we do?

516
01:07:19,969 --> 01:07:21,414
Use the stairs?

517
01:07:21,771 --> 01:07:23,375
Right. Lilly?

518
01:07:25,374 --> 01:07:26,478
Use the stairs?

519
01:07:30,212 --> 01:07:34,285
Yeah. That's excellent.
Okay, let's go get breakfast.

520
01:07:43,526 --> 01:07:44,596
Oh! God!

521
01:07:46,162 --> 01:07:48,108
Lilly, you scared
the crap out of me.

522
01:07:50,533 --> 01:07:52,945
Annabel! Breakfast is ready!

523
01:07:54,570 --> 01:07:55,605
I'll be right down!

524
01:07:57,373 --> 01:08:00,252
Annabel! Lilly's hungry!

525
01:09:05,774 --> 01:09:06,980
Annabel?

526
01:09:13,449 --> 01:09:14,894
Yeah.

527
01:09:28,063 --> 01:09:31,977
Victoria? You and Dr. Dreyfuss,
you guys talk some...

528
01:09:32,968 --> 01:09:36,006
I mean, you guys
talked a lot, right?

529
01:09:44,146 --> 01:09:46,752
Victoria, Dr. Dreyfuss and I,
we talked some, too.

530
01:09:48,284 --> 01:09:49,388
We talked about Mama.

531
01:09:51,820 --> 01:09:56,496
You and Dr. Dreyfuss, you... You
guys talked about Mama, too, right?

532
01:10:03,632 --> 01:10:05,578
Who is Mama, Victoria?

533
01:10:11,540 --> 01:10:14,749
- This is Dr. Gerald Dreyfuss.
- Please leave a message.

534
01:10:14,810 --> 01:10:17,484
Hey, it's Annabel,
I need to talk to you,

535
01:10:17,546 --> 01:10:21,187
so please call me whenever you
get this, okay? Thanks, bye.

536
01:11:05,928 --> 01:11:09,432
Yes, I talked to
Lieutenant Spencer two hours ago.

537
01:11:10,466 --> 01:11:14,243
I'm sure you are.
I just don't understand.

538
01:11:14,770 --> 01:11:18,445
I am afraid that something bad
may have happened to the doctor.

539
01:11:25,414 --> 01:11:26,449
You okay?

540
01:11:36,492 --> 01:11:37,800
Stay there.

541
01:11:54,510 --> 01:11:56,148
Come on, get your coats.

542
01:12:29,945 --> 01:12:35,019
Richmond. I need the number for
Enterprise Rent-A-Car. Yeah.

543
01:14:23,959 --> 01:14:26,439
<i>I want you
to tell me the story again.</i>

544
01:14:30,098 --> 01:14:31,509
<i>Can you tell me the story?</i>

545
01:14:31,600 --> 01:14:33,739
<i>It was a longtime ago.</i>

546
01:14:33,802 --> 01:14:36,248
<i>A lady ran away from a
hospital for sad people.</i>

547
01:14:37,573 --> 01:14:41,419
<i>She took her baby,
They jumped into the water.</i>

548
01:14:42,144 --> 01:14:46,320
<i>How could you know that story, Victoria?
Did Mama tell you that story?</i>

549
01:14:48,717 --> 01:14:49,957
<i>She showed me.</i>

550
01:14:50,486 --> 01:14:51,829
<i>How?</i>

551
01:14:51,887 --> 01:14:52,991
<i>In a dream.</i>

552
01:14:53,288 --> 01:14:54,358
<i>Go on.</i>

553
01:14:54,623 --> 01:14:58,662
<i>She fell into the water,
but the baby didn't.</i>

554
01:15:00,429 --> 01:15:01,407
<i>Why?</i>

555
01:15:02,898 --> 01:15:03,899
<i>I don't know.</i>

556
01:15:04,633 --> 01:15:06,874
<i>What could have
happened to the baby, Victoria?</i>

557
01:15:07,302 --> 01:15:08,372
<i>I don't know.</i>

558
01:15:10,405 --> 01:15:11,850
<i>Mama didn't show you?</i>

559
01:15:15,043 --> 01:15:17,148
<i>She doesn't know
what happened to her baby.</i>

560
01:15:24,720 --> 01:15:27,701
<i>She went walking in the
woods, looking for it.</i>

561
01:15:28,857 --> 01:15:30,894
<i>She searched for
a very long time.</i>

562
01:15:31,460 --> 01:15:32,530
<i>And then?</i>

563
01:15:33,996 --> 01:15:35,134
<i>Then she found us.</i>

564
01:15:36,164 --> 01:15:37,541
<i>Why are you crying, Victoria?</i>

565
01:15:38,967 --> 01:15:40,571
<i>'Cause she's sad.</i>

566
01:15:47,309 --> 01:15:49,915
<i>Is she sad, or are
you sad, Victoria?</i>

567
01:15:52,047 --> 01:15:55,722
<i>Where is Mama?
Is she here, with us?</i>

568
01:15:58,320 --> 01:15:59,765
<i>Can you show me Mama?</i>

569
01:16:00,289 --> 01:16:01,632
<i>She won't come here.</i>

570
01:16:01,990 --> 01:16:03,298
<i>Why not?</i>

571
01:16:05,160 --> 01:16:07,231
<i>Because she knows
you're watching.</i>

572
01:16:37,626 --> 01:16:41,733
<i>This is Annabel. Leave
your message at the beep. Fuck you! Beep!</i>

573
01:16:51,907 --> 01:16:53,079
Annabel?

574
01:16:54,009 --> 01:16:55,010
Oh.

575
01:16:55,644 --> 01:16:57,214
Hey, Victoria.

576
01:16:58,213 --> 01:16:59,283
Are you okay?

577
01:17:00,248 --> 01:17:01,693
Yeah, I'm fine.

578
01:17:24,439 --> 01:17:26,009
Good night, Annabel.

579
01:17:30,045 --> 01:17:31,422
I love you.

580
01:17:34,216 --> 01:17:35,286
No.

581
01:19:55,857 --> 01:19:57,029
Lilly!

582
01:20:01,263 --> 01:20:02,469
Lilly!

583
01:20:09,571 --> 01:20:11,244
Don't look at her!

584
01:20:15,977 --> 01:20:17,354
She's mad.

585
01:20:18,113 --> 01:20:21,026
Run! Lilly!

586
01:20:25,587 --> 01:20:26,793
Lilly!

587
01:20:29,057 --> 01:20:32,038
Lilly, open the door!

588
01:20:47,309 --> 01:20:48,344
Victoria!
What's going on?

589
01:20:48,410 --> 01:20:49,684
Are you okay?

590
01:20:49,811 --> 01:20:51,119
Annabel! It's Lilly!

591
01:20:53,381 --> 01:20:56,590
Lilly? Are you okay?

592
01:20:56,651 --> 01:20:57,959
Huh?

593
01:21:30,619 --> 01:21:32,121
Mama! Stop it!

594
01:21:33,021 --> 01:21:34,159
You promised!

595
01:21:39,127 --> 01:21:40,765
Leave her alone!

596
01:22:33,548 --> 01:22:36,893
Annabel! Annabel!

597
01:23:36,044 --> 01:23:37,546
Aunt Jean?

598
01:23:43,485 --> 01:23:44,828
Are you okay?

599
01:24:46,815 --> 01:24:47,885
Lilly?

600
01:24:52,020 --> 01:24:53,727
Victoria?

601
01:25:24,886 --> 01:25:26,888
<i>Hey, this
is Lucas, leave a message.</i>

602
01:25:27,689 --> 01:25:30,863
Lucas, she has the girls.
I am heading to Clifton Forge.

603
01:25:37,599 --> 01:25:38,703
Luke?

604
01:25:39,734 --> 01:25:40,769
Luke!

605
01:25:41,803 --> 01:25:42,804
Baby!

606
01:25:42,937 --> 01:25:43,938
I got your message.

607
01:25:44,372 --> 01:25:46,079
What the hell
are you doing here?

608
01:25:47,408 --> 01:25:48,769
Where are the girls?
She took them.

609
01:25:48,810 --> 01:25:50,517
What?
I saw her, she's real.

610
01:25:50,578 --> 01:25:51,750
What the hell is happening?

611
01:25:51,813 --> 01:25:53,554
She's going to kill them.
We gotta get to the cabin.

612
01:25:53,815 --> 01:25:57,922
She was here with them the whole time.
Dr. Dreyfuss knew it.

613
01:25:57,986 --> 01:25:59,260
Oh, God!

614
01:26:23,878 --> 01:26:25,050
Jean?

615
01:26:50,205 --> 01:26:51,548
They're on the cliff!

616
01:27:18,266 --> 01:27:19,973
Victoria! Lilly!

617
01:27:23,605 --> 01:27:24,709
No.

618
01:27:32,513 --> 01:27:33,514
No, no.

619
01:27:33,615 --> 01:27:34,753
Mama!

620
01:27:34,882 --> 01:27:36,020
No. Lilly! Lilly!

621
01:27:36,784 --> 01:27:37,785
No!

622
01:27:46,361 --> 01:27:47,499
Mama!

623
01:27:50,598 --> 01:27:51,941
Edith!

624
01:29:17,018 --> 01:29:18,156
Mama!
No!

625
01:29:20,655 --> 01:29:21,861
Lilly?

626
01:29:51,352 --> 01:29:52,831
Mama, no! Mama!

627
01:30:01,195 --> 01:30:02,230
Mama!

628
01:30:21,416 --> 01:30:22,759
Stay here.

629
01:30:29,624 --> 01:30:30,625
Bye, Annabel.

630
01:30:40,067 --> 01:30:41,102
Sleep, Annabel!

631
01:30:43,104 --> 01:30:45,448
Victoria, Lilly.

632
01:31:15,903 --> 01:31:17,849
- Sleep, Annabel.
- Sleep.

633
01:31:24,545 --> 01:31:25,580
Sleep.

634
01:32:07,154 --> 01:32:08,497
Goodbye, Mama,

635
01:32:10,591 --> 01:32:11,865
I love you.

636
01:32:17,832 --> 01:32:20,039
Victoria, come.

637
01:32:21,335 --> 01:32:22,814
Victoria stay.

638
01:32:24,805 --> 01:32:29,151
Come, Lilly, Mama, Victoria.

639
01:32:29,877 --> 01:32:34,257
No, Lilly, Mama.

640
01:32:43,057 --> 01:32:45,799
Lilly! Lilly!

641
01:32:46,193 --> 01:32:48,195
Victoria, no!

642
01:32:48,529 --> 01:32:51,305
Lilly! Lilly!

643
01:32:51,766 --> 01:32:53,677
No! Please! No!

644
01:32:53,801 --> 01:32:55,712
Lilly!

645
01:32:55,770 --> 01:32:58,216
Oh, God, bring her back!

646
01:32:59,707 --> 01:33:01,084
Baby!

647
01:33:01,142 --> 01:33:02,621
Lilly!

648
01:33:13,554 --> 01:33:15,056
Oh, my God!

649
01:33:16,691 --> 01:33:18,034
Oh, God!

650
01:33:19,393 --> 01:33:20,565
No.

651
01:33:28,069 --> 01:33:29,241
No!

652
01:34:29,764 --> 01:34:30,834
Luke?

653
01:34:42,777 --> 01:34:43,983
Lilly?
