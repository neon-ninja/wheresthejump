1
00:02:47,667 --> 00:02:51,170
Shh-shh-shh.

2
00:02:52,839 --> 00:02:55,007
- Hey.
- Peter...

3
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:57,092
Shh, just a dream.

4
00:02:57,093 --> 00:02:59,011
Shh.

5
00:02:59,012 --> 00:03:02,181
It's just a dream. Hey.

6
00:03:03,766 --> 00:03:07,644
Go on back to sleep.
Back to sleep.

7
00:03:08,688 --> 00:03:10,314
Shh.

8
00:04:24,055 --> 00:04:27,140
And what's your
line of work, Felix?

9
00:04:27,141 --> 00:04:29,601
I'm a musician.

10
00:04:29,602 --> 00:04:30,727
Jazz?

11
00:04:30,728 --> 00:04:33,939
What other kind of
music is there?

12
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:36,066
You play anywhere?

13
00:04:36,067 --> 00:04:39,111
Place called Ellington's.

14
00:04:39,612 --> 00:04:42,572
Ellington's, on
Brunswick Street?

15
00:04:42,573 --> 00:04:43,949
Uh-huh.

16
00:04:44,534 --> 00:04:46,285
You mean you used
to play there.

17
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:49,621
No... no... I played
there just last weekend.

18
00:04:49,622 --> 00:04:54,960
Ellington's - the place with
all the statues out the front?

19
00:04:54,961 --> 00:04:57,045
That's the one.

20
00:04:58,464 --> 00:05:03,760
If I'm not mistaken, that
place has been gone for years.

21
00:05:04,345 --> 00:05:08,890
Look, I... I really don't
know what you're getting at.

22
00:05:09,851 --> 00:05:11,476
Can you tell me
who the President

23
00:05:11,477 --> 00:05:13,979
of the United States is, Felix?

24
00:05:14,647 --> 00:05:16,565
What sort of a
question is that?

25
00:05:16,566 --> 00:05:19,860
Just curious.

26
00:05:22,071 --> 00:05:23,822
Ronald Reagan.

27
00:05:24,866 --> 00:05:26,450
And what year are we in?

28
00:05:29,871 --> 00:05:32,581
1987.

29
00:05:32,582 --> 00:05:34,041
Right?

30
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:42,799
Have we... have we met before?

31
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:48,347
Yes. Right here, last week.

32
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:04,654
So how's the new job?

33
00:06:04,655 --> 00:06:06,531
Oh, don't get me
wrong, Duncan,

34
00:06:06,532 --> 00:06:08,700
I appreciate you
passing a few cases,

35
00:06:08,701 --> 00:06:12,079
but assessment work is like...

36
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:15,165
It reminds me of
being your assistant.

37
00:06:15,166 --> 00:06:19,544
- You miss Sydney?
- No.

38
00:06:19,545 --> 00:06:21,755
I miss analysis.

39
00:06:22,173 --> 00:06:25,717
I miss my patients, even
more than I thought I would.

40
00:06:25,718 --> 00:06:31,139
What do you think? You need
more help than they do now?

41
00:06:33,142 --> 00:06:36,812
It's not easy, facing things.

42
00:06:39,148 --> 00:06:41,900
And how would you face things?

43
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:47,906
Pete, I'm here to
help you face it.

44
00:06:47,907 --> 00:06:51,410
And I really appreciate it.

45
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:54,913
I wasn't even sure
you'd be alive.

46
00:06:54,914 --> 00:06:57,749
Well...

47
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,085
You marry the prettiest
girl on campus,

48
00:07:00,086 --> 00:07:01,962
you take off to
Sydney and you...

49
00:07:01,963 --> 00:07:04,923
...you disappear for years.

50
00:07:04,924 --> 00:07:07,926
Oh, you know, life.

51
00:07:09,387 --> 00:07:12,264
Life.

52
00:07:14,934 --> 00:07:19,646
So how's Carol been
through all this?

53
00:07:22,483 --> 00:07:24,484
Devastated.

54
00:07:26,946 --> 00:07:34,035
Are either of you able to...
are you able to say her name?

55
00:07:34,996 --> 00:07:40,125
- Yes.
- Say her name, Pete.

56
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:54,055
Evie.

57
00:07:56,142 --> 00:07:58,935
Ev... Evie.

58
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:25,587
Ow!

59
00:08:25,588 --> 00:08:27,547
Oh, baby, cut yourself?

60
00:08:27,548 --> 00:08:33,803
Oh, shh. Hmm. You'll live.

61
00:08:48,861 --> 00:08:52,739
What was it that
caught your attention?

62
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:53,532
What?

63
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:56,117
You said you took your
eyes off Evie that day.

64
00:08:56,118 --> 00:09:00,372
What exactly was it that
caught your attention?

65
00:09:17,515 --> 00:09:20,016
Can't... can't remember.

66
00:09:22,728 --> 00:09:26,022
It'll come to you.

67
00:09:30,945 --> 00:09:37,826
I just need to sleep. I want
to close my eyes and...

68
00:09:37,827 --> 00:09:40,036
Just need to sleep.

69
00:09:40,037 --> 00:09:41,580
I'm starting to hate people.

70
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:42,998
I don't
want to be manic.

71
00:09:50,715 --> 00:09:55,427
And it was so awful...
the black, I mean.

72
00:09:58,014 --> 00:10:03,977
- Am I boring you?
- I'm listening.

73
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:07,856
People ignore me all
the time, you know.

74
00:10:11,444 --> 00:10:14,279
- Like who?
- Benny.

75
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:17,240
- Who's that?
- My daughter.

76
00:10:17,241 --> 00:10:21,620
It's not a real name,
it's just what I call her.

77
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:24,706
Although I don't know
why I call her anything.

78
00:10:24,707 --> 00:10:27,917
Sometimes I think
I'm invisible.

79
00:10:28,544 --> 00:10:30,503
Well, I see you.

80
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:35,925
I wonder what I'm
doing here sometimes.

81
00:10:37,678 --> 00:10:42,515
- What do you mean by that?
- You know what I mean.

82
00:10:47,355 --> 00:10:51,274
You mean you have thoughts
of killing yourself?

83
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:55,028
I just can't do it.

84
00:11:25,768 --> 00:11:27,143
Hello.

85
00:11:27,144 --> 00:11:30,021
Who are you here to see?

86
00:11:33,609 --> 00:11:37,487
Oh. Is your mum or your
dad here with you?

87
00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:43,910
Want to come in?

88
00:11:45,871 --> 00:11:47,205
Come in.

89
00:11:53,963 --> 00:11:58,800
I'm Dr Bower.
You can call me Peter.

90
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:02,679
Have a seat.
Take your pick.

91
00:12:05,683 --> 00:12:10,812
Good
choice. The comfy one.

92
00:12:14,984 --> 00:12:20,405
Have they given you a letter
or something for me to read?

93
00:12:34,587 --> 00:12:37,881
Elizabeth Valentine.

94
00:12:37,882 --> 00:12:40,008
Lovely name.

95
00:12:44,138 --> 00:12:46,389
Hello, Elizabeth.

96
00:12:47,391 --> 00:12:49,350
Can you speak?

97
00:12:53,272 --> 00:12:57,525
Well, I know you can read.

98
00:13:03,073 --> 00:13:05,700
Can you write?

99
00:13:24,762 --> 00:13:28,807
Don't worry. Don't worry.
It's just a train.

100
00:13:31,644 --> 00:13:33,812
Hey, wait.

101
00:13:33,813 --> 00:13:34,979
Wait, wait!

102
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:33,037
What are you doing?

103
00:14:33,747 --> 00:14:39,002
Nothing. Just... looking
for an old... case file.

104
00:14:40,337 --> 00:14:42,505
In her box of things?

105
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:48,386
- I'm sorry.
- There's no need to apologise.

106
00:14:50,264 --> 00:14:53,057
- Did I wake you?
- No.

107
00:14:53,058 --> 00:14:58,438
- Been taking your pills?
- I slept all day.

108
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:03,276
I'm beginning to wonder if I
shouldn't stop taking them.

109
00:15:03,277 --> 00:15:07,697
So we can have a
repeat of last time?

110
00:15:09,033 --> 00:15:11,910
I'm sorry.

111
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:14,579
Stop apologising.

112
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:17,206
Please.

113
00:15:18,292 --> 00:15:20,585
It's her
anniversary next week.

114
00:15:20,586 --> 00:15:22,837
Anniversary?

115
00:15:23,255 --> 00:15:27,216
Anniversary is
something you celebrate.

116
00:15:30,721 --> 00:15:33,097
Why did we move here, Peter?

117
00:15:33,098 --> 00:15:36,225
You know why we moved here.

118
00:15:38,228 --> 00:15:40,396
To move on.

119
00:15:52,534 --> 00:15:55,244
Shit!

120
00:16:40,916 --> 00:16:42,959
Elizabeth?

121
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:46,504
How did you get in here?

122
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:51,926
Elizabeth?

123
00:17:04,732 --> 00:17:07,525
What is it?

124
00:17:07,526 --> 00:17:09,193
Elizabeth.

125
00:17:09,570 --> 00:17:13,406
What do you see?

126
00:17:13,407 --> 00:17:14,866
Hold on.

127
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:17,869
Elizabeth, listen to me.

128
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:21,205
Just try and speak, OK?

129
00:17:21,206 --> 00:17:23,124
What is it? What is it?

130
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:24,959
What's over there? Huh?

131
00:17:41,435 --> 00:17:43,102
Hey, no...

132
00:17:43,812 --> 00:17:45,146
Come on.

133
00:18:10,589 --> 00:18:12,173
Hey.

134
00:18:13,258 --> 00:18:14,467
Elizabeth?

135
00:18:26,605 --> 00:18:28,564
I've got to be honest
with you, Pete.

136
00:18:28,565 --> 00:18:32,568
All I hear is a train,
a lot of racket

137
00:18:32,569 --> 00:18:34,779
and you talking to yourself.

138
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:37,615
If it wasn't for this doll,
you'd have a pretty hard time

139
00:18:37,616 --> 00:18:42,120
convincing me that you didn't
just... imagine all of this.

140
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:45,248
Why would I... why
would I imagine it?

141
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:51,921
- How old would Evie be now?
- Come on, Dunc.

142
00:18:51,922 --> 00:18:54,966
Elizabeth Valentine.
That was her name, wasn't it?

143
00:18:54,967 --> 00:18:57,426
Yes. That was on
her train pass.

144
00:18:58,512 --> 00:19:02,557
- Where is her train pass?
- I gave it back to her.

145
00:19:03,976 --> 00:19:06,394
I just want you to
think for a bit.

146
00:19:06,395 --> 00:19:08,563
- Just take her initials.
- Whose?

147
00:19:08,564 --> 00:19:10,731
The girl's, Elizabeth
Valentine's.

148
00:19:10,732 --> 00:19:13,901
- Take her initials.
- E-V.

149
00:19:23,829 --> 00:19:28,666
What about the doll?
Where did that come from?

150
00:19:28,667 --> 00:19:30,376
Anywhere. It could be...

151
00:19:30,377 --> 00:19:34,005
Could be Evie's. Have you been
through her things lately?

152
00:19:34,006 --> 00:19:35,173
You're making it...

153
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:38,593
You're making it sound
like something it's not.

154
00:19:39,678 --> 00:19:41,262
Sit down.

155
00:19:49,605 --> 00:19:54,358
- It's OK, Pete.
- Doesn't feel OK.

156
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:56,319
Good.

157
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:59,697
As Jung would say, 'Now
we're getting somewhere.'

158
00:19:59,698 --> 00:20:05,828
So, just relax, and tell me
exactly what you're feeling.

159
00:20:13,837 --> 00:20:19,550
That's funny. I never
noticed that before.

160
00:20:19,551 --> 00:20:21,552
What?

161
00:20:22,888 --> 00:20:24,722
That painting.

162
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:28,684
I've been having
dreams about that.

163
00:20:29,603 --> 00:20:33,064
Winter Landscape
With A Bird Trap.

164
00:20:33,065 --> 00:20:33,773
Simple title.

165
00:20:33,774 --> 00:20:36,400
But when you look
closely at a Bruegel,

166
00:20:36,401 --> 00:20:39,070
you usually find
there's something odd,

167
00:20:39,071 --> 00:20:41,113
some devil in the detail.

168
00:20:46,495 --> 00:20:48,829
It's the bird trap.

169
00:20:50,374 --> 00:20:53,834
You can't see the bird
trapper hiding in the window.

170
00:20:56,922 --> 00:20:59,090
That's what disturbs
me in the dream.

171
00:20:59,091 --> 00:21:03,094
The dream is
asking a question.

172
00:21:03,095 --> 00:21:05,054
Who's pulling the string?

173
00:21:05,055 --> 00:21:09,267
Who is it that you don't
want to see, Peter?

174
00:21:09,268 --> 00:21:11,852
What?

175
00:21:12,521 --> 00:21:15,189
Who is it in that window?

176
00:22:34,686 --> 00:22:37,938
We have her.

177
00:22:40,609 --> 00:22:43,069
Who?

178
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:45,196
Evie.

179
00:24:39,644 --> 00:24:41,395
Missed your stop.

180
00:24:43,482 --> 00:24:46,233
Erica. Your patient.

181
00:24:47,152 --> 00:24:52,740
- Erica...
- You've been sleeping.

182
00:24:55,035 --> 00:24:56,702
What was the last station?

183
00:24:56,703 --> 00:24:58,996
Do you remember
what we talked about

184
00:24:58,997 --> 00:25:00,998
in your room the other day?

185
00:25:01,124 --> 00:25:05,503
I've been thinking about it,
how I can't kill myself.

186
00:25:05,504 --> 00:25:10,299
- Have you?
- I'm sorry. I need to...

187
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:11,800
I've realised why.

188
00:25:11,801 --> 00:25:14,512
It's simple. I'm already...

189
00:27:01,119 --> 00:27:03,412
Duncan, it's Peter.

190
00:27:04,664 --> 00:27:06,498
Please...

191
00:27:06,499 --> 00:27:09,877
I know it's late.
Please give me a call.

192
00:27:09,878 --> 00:27:12,379
Please.

193
00:27:53,129 --> 00:27:54,380
The really weird thing is

194
00:27:54,381 --> 00:27:57,591
they all seem to have died
within a day of each other.

195
00:27:57,592 --> 00:28:00,678
- July 12th?
- Yes.

196
00:28:03,014 --> 00:28:06,141
Does that date mean
anything to you?

197
00:28:07,185 --> 00:28:10,187
- No.
- You're sure?

198
00:28:10,188 --> 00:28:12,356
Just think.

199
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:18,070
Look, Dunc, I wouldn't be
bringing this up to you

200
00:28:18,071 --> 00:28:21,240
if I didn't think it was
crazy myself, but...

201
00:28:22,242 --> 00:28:23,617
Look...

202
00:28:25,036 --> 00:28:27,121
These are the patients.

203
00:28:28,623 --> 00:28:31,250
Here's the list.

204
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:42,428
You're not saying anything.

205
00:28:44,180 --> 00:28:48,392
I know if I...
I think logically...

206
00:28:49,185 --> 00:28:51,395
...I must be hallucinating
the whole thing.

207
00:28:51,396 --> 00:28:54,189
Like there's a
kind of breakdown.

208
00:28:54,190 --> 00:28:58,152
But there are things
that don't add up,

209
00:28:58,153 --> 00:29:00,320
even if that were the case.

210
00:29:01,156 --> 00:29:02,698
Like what?

211
00:29:03,408 --> 00:29:07,327
Like the fact that you
referred me these patients.

212
00:29:09,998 --> 00:29:13,417
Well, if I referred
you your patients...

213
00:29:14,753 --> 00:29:18,422
...what would that make me?

214
00:29:45,074 --> 00:29:47,075
1987.

215
00:32:32,116 --> 00:32:35,744
- Well...
- Hi, Dad.

216
00:32:35,745 --> 00:32:38,080
Come in.

217
00:32:43,252 --> 00:32:45,963
Aren't you supposed
to be busy?

218
00:32:52,303 --> 00:32:54,388
You drive up?

219
00:32:54,389 --> 00:32:56,807
No, took the train.

220
00:32:56,808 --> 00:32:58,809
How's work?

221
00:33:00,645 --> 00:33:03,105
Work's... whatever.

222
00:33:05,608 --> 00:33:07,859
You ever throw anything out?

223
00:33:11,406 --> 00:33:12,572
So what's happened?

224
00:33:12,573 --> 00:33:15,367
- What do you mean?
- What's really going on?

225
00:33:15,368 --> 00:33:18,161
You turn up
unannounced, no car,

226
00:33:18,162 --> 00:33:20,497
an overnight bag,
without Carol.

227
00:33:20,498 --> 00:33:22,457
You two OK?

228
00:33:22,625 --> 00:33:26,003
- I thought I was the shrink.
- Yeah.

229
00:33:26,004 --> 00:33:27,170
I'm the cop.

230
00:33:27,171 --> 00:33:29,673
- Retired, remember?
- Mm.

231
00:33:29,674 --> 00:33:33,760
- I've still got a nose.
- Yeah.

232
00:33:40,184 --> 00:33:42,853
I saw you took down
the photos of Mum.

233
00:33:42,854 --> 00:33:46,106
It's been ten years.

234
00:33:50,111 --> 00:33:52,654
Don't touch that.

235
00:33:54,866 --> 00:33:57,200
What do you do in here anyway?

236
00:33:57,201 --> 00:33:59,369
Man stuff.

237
00:34:00,538 --> 00:34:02,831
Man stuff!

238
00:34:02,832 --> 00:34:06,501
You were always in here when
I was a kid, avoiding us.

239
00:34:09,881 --> 00:34:13,633
Sorry I didn't come
to Evie's funeral.

240
00:34:15,011 --> 00:34:16,720
I was too upset.

241
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:23,060
Is that what you're
calling drunk these days?

242
00:34:25,396 --> 00:34:29,066
- How long are you staying?
- Couple of days.

243
00:34:29,067 --> 00:34:31,610
Guess you want your room back.

244
00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:36,193
Want something to eat?

245
00:36:37,111 --> 00:36:38,403
Nah.

246
00:36:41,282 --> 00:36:42,949
Don't wait up.

247
00:37:08,226 --> 00:37:10,018
Hi, Baz.

248
00:37:13,397 --> 00:37:15,857
Jesus Christ.

249
00:37:17,944 --> 00:37:20,153
Fuck, mate.

250
00:37:20,154 --> 00:37:24,241
You've had a really
shit couple of years.

251
00:37:24,242 --> 00:37:27,035
It's good to see you, though.

252
00:37:28,704 --> 00:37:30,956
Fuckin' life, ey?

253
00:37:31,582 --> 00:37:34,376
I mean, I... I can't
even imagine...

254
00:37:34,377 --> 00:37:37,420
...what it is you must
be going through.

255
00:37:37,922 --> 00:37:40,465
It's made me think a
lot about my past.

256
00:37:40,466 --> 00:37:47,138
Addressing it, you know...
the things I've done.

257
00:37:48,224 --> 00:37:50,976
I wanted to talk to
you about something.

258
00:37:52,144 --> 00:37:53,937
What?

259
00:37:56,023 --> 00:37:58,775
About what happened.

260
00:38:01,237 --> 00:38:03,530
What are you talking about?

261
00:38:06,325 --> 00:38:08,785
1987.

262
00:38:10,371 --> 00:38:12,747
1987, you know.

263
00:38:13,749 --> 00:38:15,458
You're not talking about...

264
00:38:15,459 --> 00:38:20,297
- Shit. We promised...
- Yeah, we were young.

265
00:38:20,298 --> 00:38:21,798
...we would never
talk about that.

266
00:38:21,799 --> 00:38:26,344
- We were teenagers.
- Exactly. We were just kids.

267
00:38:28,180 --> 00:38:32,726
I... can't help but think...

268
00:38:35,354 --> 00:38:37,897
...Evie's death
had something...

269
00:38:37,898 --> 00:38:39,983
some kind of...

270
00:38:40,192 --> 00:38:41,192
...I don't know...

271
00:38:41,193 --> 00:38:44,195
- What?
Some kind of what?

272
00:38:47,158 --> 00:38:50,702
Look, I don't even really know
what happened that night.

273
00:38:50,703 --> 00:38:52,912
And neither do you.
- People died.

274
00:38:52,913 --> 00:38:56,541
- Can we please just drop this?
- People died!

275
00:38:56,542 --> 00:38:59,961
Right, so, you come
all the way back here

276
00:38:59,962 --> 00:39:01,379
just to dig this shit up.

277
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:04,341
I don't know... maybe.

278
00:39:04,342 --> 00:39:07,761
Maybe I just had to
clear my conscience.

279
00:39:09,388 --> 00:39:13,099
With who? With who?

280
00:39:15,019 --> 00:39:16,770
With the police?

281
00:39:17,772 --> 00:39:19,272
- I don't know...
- Look.

282
00:39:19,273 --> 00:39:22,525
I'm not you, alright?
I'm not rich.

283
00:39:22,526 --> 00:39:24,194
I can't afford lawyers.

284
00:39:24,195 --> 00:39:25,195
They put people in jail

285
00:39:25,196 --> 00:39:27,447
for this sort of shit
for fucking years.

286
00:39:27,448 --> 00:39:29,741
I got to live in
this bloody town.

287
00:39:30,451 --> 00:39:32,702
Do you believe in ghosts?

288
00:39:32,703 --> 00:39:38,249
You know what?
Fuck you, Peter.

289
00:39:38,250 --> 00:39:39,209
Fuck you!

290
00:39:39,210 --> 00:39:43,421
You stay the fuck
away from me. Got it?

291
00:40:36,767 --> 00:40:39,436
Remind me again.
Why are we doing this?

292
00:40:39,437 --> 00:40:42,689
Because we're
14 and we're virgins.

293
00:40:42,690 --> 00:40:45,442
If this is a make-out place,
don't we need chicks?

294
00:40:45,443 --> 00:40:47,777
As if you'd
know what to do with one.

295
00:40:47,778 --> 00:40:50,738
How do you know
about this place anyway?

296
00:40:50,739 --> 00:40:53,074
- Steve told me.
- Your brother?

297
00:40:53,075 --> 00:40:55,618
- And you believed him?
- Why wouldn't I?

298
00:40:55,619 --> 00:40:59,247
- He hates you.
- What would you know?

299
00:40:59,248 --> 00:41:01,166
Just trust me.

300
00:41:11,093 --> 00:41:12,927
You coming?

301
00:41:29,987 --> 00:41:33,740
Oh! Check that out. Jackpot.

302
00:41:40,372 --> 00:41:42,790
Dinner and a show.

303
00:41:47,755 --> 00:41:50,798
How do you know it's not
two blokes in there?

304
00:41:50,799 --> 00:41:52,884
What's wrong with you?

305
00:41:53,928 --> 00:41:56,763
I don't know. Maybe we
shouldn't be watching this.

306
00:41:56,764 --> 00:41:59,390
OK, Richie
Cunningham. Then go.

307
00:41:59,391 --> 00:42:01,643
I'll let you know
how it ends.

308
00:42:05,564 --> 00:42:07,565
What was that?

309
00:42:07,566 --> 00:42:08,233
Shit.

310
00:42:08,234 --> 00:42:10,026
- Do you think they saw us?
- Shh.

311
00:42:10,027 --> 00:42:11,861
- I think they saw us.
- Shh.

312
00:42:11,862 --> 00:42:13,863
- Did you hear that?
- Hear what?

313
00:42:13,864 --> 00:42:15,990
Listen.

314
00:42:15,991 --> 00:42:18,368
- Train.
- Shit, the bikes!

315
00:42:28,963 --> 00:42:30,296
Barry!

316
00:44:40,010 --> 00:44:41,678
Daddy.

317
00:44:47,434 --> 00:44:49,060
Look.

318
00:44:59,655 --> 00:45:01,114
Evie!

319
00:49:12,532 --> 00:49:15,117
So you were the
only one involved.

320
00:49:15,118 --> 00:49:17,495
That's right.

321
00:49:18,288 --> 00:49:23,668
You're... you're not related
to Bill Bower, by any chance?

322
00:49:24,127 --> 00:49:27,588
I'm his son.

323
00:49:28,840 --> 00:49:32,510
Wasn't your dad
sergeant at the time?

324
00:49:33,178 --> 00:49:35,596
You never mentioned
this to him?

325
00:49:37,099 --> 00:49:39,141
No.

326
00:49:39,142 --> 00:49:41,769
So why bring it up now?

327
00:49:45,983 --> 00:49:50,152
I just want to...
put things to rest.

328
00:49:51,196 --> 00:49:52,697
Properly.

329
00:49:56,326 --> 00:49:59,537
Can you excuse
me for a second?

330
00:50:43,623 --> 00:50:45,624
Sorry about that.

331
00:50:47,419 --> 00:50:50,463
- Is that your mum?
- Yeah.

332
00:50:50,464 --> 00:50:53,549
She died in the accident.

333
00:50:53,550 --> 00:50:58,804
- I'm sorry.
- Well, it's no secret.

334
00:50:58,805 --> 00:51:00,890
It... it must have
been very hard

335
00:51:00,891 --> 00:51:02,558
for you to hear my statement.

336
00:51:02,559 --> 00:51:05,061
Well, it's my job.

337
00:51:05,437 --> 00:51:08,898
- I meant, you know...
- Yeah, I know what you meant.

338
00:51:10,984 --> 00:51:15,029
Not many people could have
faced up to what you did.

339
00:51:15,030 --> 00:51:17,948
I really appreciate
your honesty.

340
00:51:19,326 --> 00:51:22,244
I'll file a report
with the coroner.

341
00:51:22,245 --> 00:51:25,331
I can't imagine
there'll be any charges.

342
00:51:25,332 --> 00:51:27,083
You were just a teenager.

343
00:51:27,084 --> 00:51:31,504
It was an act of
negligence at worst.

344
00:51:32,464 --> 00:51:38,010
Thank you.

345
00:51:42,849 --> 00:51:45,518
I...

346
00:51:45,519 --> 00:51:47,311
I came to your house once.

347
00:51:47,312 --> 00:51:52,691
Your dad invited me over
right after the accident.

348
00:51:52,692 --> 00:51:56,153
Mum was the only local
who died in the accident.

349
00:51:57,989 --> 00:52:01,158
He was very kind
to me, your dad.

350
00:52:02,285 --> 00:52:07,081
I think it was after that
I wanted to be a cop.

351
00:52:21,388 --> 00:52:24,473
Hi, sweetheart.
I'm... I'm at my dad's.

352
00:52:24,474 --> 00:52:27,059
I'm sorry I haven't
called until now.

353
00:52:27,769 --> 00:52:31,522
I had to come back and put
something to rest here,

354
00:52:31,523 --> 00:52:35,609
something that happened
a long time ago.

355
00:52:36,820 --> 00:52:41,031
Things will get better,
Carol. I promise.

356
00:52:43,493 --> 00:52:45,452
I love you.

357
00:52:48,790 --> 00:52:51,834
Thank you for
using this messaging service.

358
00:52:51,835 --> 00:52:55,212
Press star to continue
or just hang up.

359
00:53:30,707 --> 00:53:33,417
Dad?

360
00:55:48,136 --> 00:55:49,887
How's the throat?

361
00:55:50,680 --> 00:55:51,889
Stay away.

362
00:55:51,890 --> 00:55:55,184
That's no way to talk
to an old friend, Peter.

363
00:55:55,185 --> 00:55:57,561
Wha... what do you want?

364
00:55:57,562 --> 00:56:03,359
It's not what I want.
We're your ghosts, Peter.

365
00:56:03,360 --> 00:56:06,236
You're the one that's
holding on to us.

366
00:56:06,654 --> 00:56:10,240
I put it to rest.
I told the truth.

367
00:56:10,241 --> 00:56:13,619
Then why are we still here?

368
00:56:14,371 --> 00:56:17,414
Two bikes
derailing a train engine.

369
00:56:17,415 --> 00:56:20,167
Do you really think
that's possible?

370
00:56:20,418 --> 00:56:24,380
Listen, some memories
are so unacceptable,

371
00:56:24,381 --> 00:56:27,132
we'll do anything we
can to forget them.

372
00:56:27,133 --> 00:56:30,260
And if that doesn't
work, we change them.

373
00:56:30,261 --> 00:56:31,220
Look at you.

374
00:56:31,221 --> 00:56:34,264
You barely remember your
own daughter's death.

375
00:56:34,265 --> 00:56:36,183
What does that have
to do with this?

376
00:56:36,184 --> 00:56:41,688
Well, I don't know, but
you must, somewhere inside.

377
00:56:41,689 --> 00:56:45,734
Peter, what distracted you?

378
00:56:45,735 --> 00:56:50,781
You said you looked
away the day Evie died.

379
00:56:50,782 --> 00:56:52,866
What was it?

380
00:56:52,867 --> 00:56:56,745
What is it you
don't want to remember?

381
00:58:24,334 --> 00:58:25,667
Barry!

382
00:59:34,737 --> 00:59:37,322
Senior Constable Henning.

383
00:59:40,410 --> 00:59:43,745
Don't touch a thing.
I'll be right there.

384
01:00:02,140 --> 01:00:04,224
So here we are again.

385
01:00:05,393 --> 01:00:06,852
What happened?

386
01:00:09,647 --> 01:00:11,356
I just found him
there like that.

387
01:00:11,357 --> 01:00:13,191
No, that's not what I meant.

388
01:00:13,192 --> 01:00:16,403
This isn't a coincidence, is it?

389
01:00:18,031 --> 01:00:21,617
We both left our
bikes on the track.

390
01:00:23,286 --> 01:00:27,289
I told... I told Barry
last night that...

391
01:00:27,290 --> 01:00:29,791
I was going to make a
statement to the police.

392
01:00:29,792 --> 01:00:31,752
He begged
me not to mention him.

393
01:00:31,753 --> 01:00:35,047
So what am I supposed
to believe now? This story?

394
01:00:35,048 --> 01:00:35,589
He begged me.

395
01:00:35,590 --> 01:00:37,090
Or the one you spun
me this morning?

396
01:00:37,091 --> 01:00:41,428
He's a friend. I didn't
want to drag him into this.

397
01:00:42,680 --> 01:00:44,848
I'm sorry.

398
01:00:46,142 --> 01:00:49,603
When you get your head
clear, I expect a call.

399
01:00:54,442 --> 01:00:55,942
Take him home.

400
01:03:07,492 --> 01:03:09,493
Found this at the scene,

401
01:03:09,494 --> 01:03:11,286
some trinket between
the floorboards.

402
01:03:11,287 --> 01:03:14,498
Looks like it's been
there a while. Goodnight.

403
01:03:14,499 --> 01:03:15,832
G'night.

404
01:03:24,300 --> 01:03:27,052
I think she
wasn't on the train.

405
01:03:27,804 --> 01:03:32,974
I think I remember seeing
her running from a car

406
01:03:32,975 --> 01:03:35,894
just before the accident.

407
01:03:36,145 --> 01:03:38,730
You think you
remember seeing her.

408
01:03:38,731 --> 01:03:41,983
How do you know
what she looks like?

409
01:03:46,155 --> 01:03:49,950
You're going
to think I'm crazy.

410
01:03:54,080 --> 01:03:55,831
I...

411
01:03:56,874 --> 01:03:59,417
I lost my daughter
last year.

412
01:04:00,044 --> 01:04:03,839
I think... I think it
opened me up to something.

413
01:04:03,840 --> 01:04:07,092
I... I don't know.

414
01:04:09,262 --> 01:04:11,346
But I see them...

415
01:04:12,390 --> 01:04:15,016
...the people from
the accident.

416
01:04:20,648 --> 01:04:24,067
Look, I'm asking
you to help me.

417
01:04:26,195 --> 01:04:32,075
I don't think I can help you
in the way that you need help.

418
01:04:35,580 --> 01:04:42,752
Your mother, Erica,
has an English accent.

419
01:04:43,379 --> 01:04:45,422
She called you Benny.

420
01:04:46,299 --> 01:04:48,508
She's got quite a temper.

421
01:04:48,509 --> 01:04:51,803
Look, I don't know what
you're playing at, Peter...

422
01:04:51,804 --> 01:04:55,974
How would I know that? How?

423
01:04:57,727 --> 01:05:00,061
Am I right?

424
01:05:00,730 --> 01:05:04,566
You're not helping yourself
or anyone at the moment.

425
01:05:04,567 --> 01:05:06,067
You need to go home.

426
01:05:06,068 --> 01:05:10,238
Just leave here and go home!

427
01:06:10,466 --> 01:06:14,886
Please... show me.

428
01:06:17,640 --> 01:06:23,812
Elizabeth...
Elizabeth Valentine.

429
01:06:37,243 --> 01:06:41,538
Jesus.

430
01:08:27,770 --> 01:08:32,190
Barb. What time is it?

431
01:08:32,191 --> 01:08:33,483
It's late.

432
01:08:33,484 --> 01:08:36,528
If you're looking for
Peter, he's not here.

433
01:08:36,529 --> 01:08:39,239
It's probably a good thing.

434
01:08:39,949 --> 01:08:42,117
Can we talk?

435
01:08:42,952 --> 01:08:46,746
- Thanks.
- What's on your mind?

436
01:08:48,833 --> 01:08:53,128
I pulled out your old
report on the train crash.

437
01:08:53,629 --> 01:08:54,921
Do you remember it at all?

438
01:08:54,922 --> 01:08:59,134
You're talking about something
that happened 20 years ago.

439
01:08:59,135 --> 01:09:06,057
You're right. I just want
to clarify a few things.

440
01:09:06,058 --> 01:09:07,892
Listen, Barb...

441
01:09:07,893 --> 01:09:11,229
I understand you lost
someone in the accident.

442
01:09:11,230 --> 01:09:16,442
It's personal for you. But
whatever was done is done.

443
01:09:16,443 --> 01:09:20,989
And whatever way you cut it,
it was still just an accident.

444
01:09:20,990 --> 01:09:23,324
And I'm still obliged
to investigate

445
01:09:23,325 --> 01:09:24,325
your son's statement.

446
01:09:24,326 --> 01:09:27,328
Especially in light
of Barry's suicide.

447
01:09:27,580 --> 01:09:31,833
Two boys mistakenly leave
their bikes on a train track.

448
01:09:31,834 --> 01:09:33,501
It's, at best, manslaughter.

449
01:09:33,502 --> 01:09:36,129
The State can't
prosecute a manslaughter

450
01:09:36,130 --> 01:09:37,338
four years after the fact.

451
01:09:37,339 --> 01:09:42,677
I'm not sure it happened
exactly like that.

452
01:10:01,363 --> 01:10:06,659
You say here that you received
a call at the police station,

453
01:10:06,660 --> 01:10:09,370
and you proceeded to
drive to the accident.

454
01:10:09,371 --> 01:10:12,207
- Yes.
- What road did you take?

455
01:10:12,208 --> 01:10:15,793
Well, there's only one road.
Oakstone.

456
01:10:15,794 --> 01:10:17,670
- Oakstone?
- Mm-hmm.

457
01:10:17,671 --> 01:10:22,550
The level crossing at Oakstone
Road was completely blocked

458
01:10:22,551 --> 01:10:23,343
by the wreckage.

459
01:10:23,344 --> 01:10:29,098
So... how did you drive
across the tracks?

460
01:10:29,767 --> 01:10:31,726
The only way your
car could have been

461
01:10:31,727 --> 01:10:33,478
on the other side
of the tracks...

462
01:10:33,479 --> 01:10:37,106
...is if it was there
before the accident.

463
01:10:50,579 --> 01:10:54,123
They found this in the
signal box this evening.

464
01:11:03,300 --> 01:11:08,638
And I'm pretty sure it
belongs to... this girl.

465
01:11:09,765 --> 01:11:13,101
Elizabeth Valentine.
Missing schoolgirl.

466
01:11:14,895 --> 01:11:17,772
You remember
the case, don't you?

467
01:11:17,773 --> 01:11:20,108
You were in charge.

468
01:11:20,526 --> 01:11:23,194
After they found her
body in the wreckage,

469
01:11:23,195 --> 01:11:25,822
you closed the investigation.

470
01:11:26,365 --> 01:11:28,658
Out of all the victims
in the coroner's report,

471
01:11:28,659 --> 01:11:32,787
hers was the only
inconclusive cause of death.

472
01:11:35,457 --> 01:11:36,749
Come here.

473
01:11:47,928 --> 01:11:52,056
I think your son saw
something that night.

474
01:11:52,057 --> 01:11:55,435
And I think you
know what he saw.

475
01:12:29,178 --> 01:12:35,391
Well, you'll have to ask
Peter what he thinks he saw.

476
01:12:35,934 --> 01:12:39,479
I stand by my
original statement.

477
01:13:25,651 --> 01:13:28,861
Do you mind if I
wait here for Peter?

478
01:13:28,862 --> 01:13:31,697
Be my guest.

479
01:13:40,624 --> 01:13:44,377
Another cup of tea?
- No, thanks.

480
01:13:57,683 --> 01:14:00,017
Yah!

481
01:14:33,719 --> 01:14:37,180
Please leave
a message after the tone.

482
01:15:01,455 --> 01:15:03,539
What are you doing up?

483
01:15:04,708 --> 01:15:06,501
I was worried.
You took my car.

484
01:15:06,502 --> 01:15:09,587
Where have you been?
What have you been up to?

485
01:15:10,464 --> 01:15:14,842
- Remembering.
- Remembering what?

486
01:15:16,011 --> 01:15:19,096
I remembered everything.

487
01:15:19,973 --> 01:15:22,767
What are you talking about?

488
01:15:23,519 --> 01:15:26,437
Elizabeth Valentine.

489
01:15:28,690 --> 01:15:30,816
I saw you...

490
01:15:30,817 --> 01:15:34,403
I saw you...
rape and kill her

491
01:15:34,404 --> 01:15:37,698
and throw her body
in the wreck.

492
01:15:38,867 --> 01:15:43,955
That's... That's crazy.

493
01:15:46,041 --> 01:15:47,792
You're talking crazily.

494
01:15:47,793 --> 01:15:51,546
You're upset. Come
inside. It's freezing.

495
01:15:51,547 --> 01:15:54,590
I'm giving you a chance, Dad.

496
01:15:56,176 --> 01:15:59,554
I want you to call.
- Call who?

497
01:15:59,555 --> 01:16:01,889
Confess.

498
01:16:02,724 --> 01:16:05,059
You're all mixed up.

499
01:16:05,060 --> 01:16:07,728
Do it or I'll do it for you.

500
01:16:10,148 --> 01:16:12,525
Who are you calling?

501
01:16:13,986 --> 01:16:16,070
Don't do this, son.

502
01:16:17,072 --> 01:16:20,783
I'm warning you.

503
01:16:27,958 --> 01:16:30,293
What have you done?

504
01:16:31,336 --> 01:16:33,504
Get in the garage.

505
01:16:37,175 --> 01:16:39,719
I said get in the garage.

506
01:17:01,783 --> 01:17:04,660
Hold your hands out.

507
01:17:06,079 --> 01:17:08,247
How did it feel
letting me believe

508
01:17:08,248 --> 01:17:10,791
it was my fault
all these years?

509
01:17:11,501 --> 01:17:14,378
Do you think
you're so innocent?

510
01:17:14,379 --> 01:17:15,713
You kept quiet about it too.

511
01:17:15,714 --> 01:17:20,009
Apple doesn't fall
that far from the tree.

512
01:17:20,510 --> 01:17:23,387
I said hold out your hands.

513
01:17:27,643 --> 01:17:30,019
How many other
girls did you kill?

514
01:17:37,110 --> 01:17:41,739
Go ahead, Dad. It's not
going to make it go away.

515
01:17:42,324 --> 01:17:44,659
Help!

516
01:17:50,874 --> 01:17:53,250
Somebody, help!

517
01:18:04,471 --> 01:18:05,888
Yah!

518
01:18:13,188 --> 01:18:14,814
Bill?

519
01:18:35,752 --> 01:18:39,380
Bill, let me out of here!

520
01:18:42,426 --> 01:18:46,220
Bill!

521
01:19:30,015 --> 01:19:31,265
Come on!

522
01:19:42,068 --> 01:19:43,319
Shit!

523
01:19:43,320 --> 01:19:46,155
Ah! Shit!

524
01:20:03,757 --> 01:20:05,758
Bill!

525
01:20:17,479 --> 01:20:20,147
Peter! Help!

526
01:20:20,148 --> 01:20:21,816
Help me!

527
01:20:25,320 --> 01:20:26,654
Bill!

528
01:20:28,573 --> 01:20:29,990
Son!

529
01:20:31,701 --> 01:20:32,993
Get down!

530
01:23:21,246 --> 01:23:24,206
What are you thinking?

531
01:23:27,669 --> 01:23:30,295
About kids.
