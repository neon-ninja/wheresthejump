00:02:34,513 --> 00:02:35,712
<i>Oh, no.</i>

3
00:02:35,714 --> 00:02:37,616
<i>Go away.
Get out of here.</i>

4
00:03:52,061 --> 00:03:54,461
<i>All right. Test.</i>

5
00:03:57,533 --> 00:03:59,802
<i>Amaya is gonna love this.</i>

6
00:04:01,437 --> 00:04:03,572
<i>Nice, that was fast.</i>

7
00:04:05,075 --> 00:04:06,440
<i>Okay, let's see here.</i>

8
00:04:06,442 --> 00:04:08,409
<i>This thing runs so much faster</i>

9
00:04:08,411 --> 00:04:10,945
<i>than my old piece of crap.</i>

10
00:04:13,950 --> 00:04:15,318
<i>Okay.</i>

11
00:04:33,805 --> 00:04:35,473
<i>Holy cow.</i>

12
00:05:19,186 --> 00:05:21,452
<i>There you are.</i>

13
00:05:21,454 --> 00:05:22,754
<i>It's nice to see your face.</i>

14
00:05:27,061 --> 00:05:29,761
<i>I know, I know.</i>

15
00:05:29,763 --> 00:05:31,496
<i>Just remember
who has two thumbs</i>

16
00:05:31,498 --> 00:05:33,599
<i>and gives the best massages
in the world.</i>

17
00:05:33,601 --> 00:05:34,836
<i>Hmm?</i>

18
00:05:38,807 --> 00:05:42,410
<i>Hang on.</i>

19
00:05:43,111 --> 00:05:45,511
<i>Okay.</i>

20
00:05:45,513 --> 00:05:47,547
<i>So I haven't ironed out
all the bugs yet</i>

21
00:05:47,549 --> 00:05:50,050
<i>but, um, okay,
you know what, just...</i>

22
00:05:50,052 --> 00:05:52,619
<i>You ready?</i>

23
00:05:52,621 --> 00:05:54,520
<i>Okay.</i>

24
00:05:54,522 --> 00:05:56,657
<i>I got a new computer today.</i>

25
00:05:56,659 --> 00:05:58,959
<i>It's much faster
than my old one.</i>

26
00:06:03,566 --> 00:06:05,132
<i>Can you, uh,
do you understand it?</i>

27
00:06:08,938 --> 00:06:10,939
<i>Oh, I just... I just added
a new feature.</i>

28
00:06:10,941 --> 00:06:13,909
<i>So, uh, when the app
doesn't understand a word,</i>

29
00:06:13,911 --> 00:06:15,609
<i>you just... you just type it in</i>

30
00:06:15,611 --> 00:06:17,846
<i>and it automatically
connects you to the ASL site,</i>

31
00:06:17,848 --> 00:06:20,982
<i>and then there is a
video tutorial on how to do it.</i>

32
00:06:22,552 --> 00:06:24,085
<i>Oh, damn it, damn it.
Hold on, hold on.</i>

33
00:06:24,087 --> 00:06:25,120
<i>One sec, sorry.</i>

34
00:06:25,122 --> 00:06:26,523
<i>Um...</i>

35
00:06:27,691 --> 00:06:29,691
<i>Anyway,
I got the idea from, uh,</i>

36
00:06:29,693 --> 00:06:31,559
<i>from when you told me
how hard it was</i>

37
00:06:31,561 --> 00:06:32,929
<i>for you to understand me</i>

38
00:06:32,931 --> 00:06:34,431
<i>when I'm on Skype.</i>

39
00:06:38,569 --> 00:06:39,871
<i>So, what do you think?</i>

40
00:06:45,576 --> 00:06:47,445
<i>Amaya, can you... can you type?</i>

41
00:06:48,846 --> 00:06:50,481
<i>You know I can't...</i>

42
00:07:12,005 --> 00:07:13,871
<i>Amaya... slow down,</i>

43
00:07:13,873 --> 00:07:15,773
<i>there's door...</i>

44
00:07:22,615 --> 00:07:25,019
<i>Sorry, yeah,
it's the door, door.</i>

45
00:07:27,088 --> 00:07:28,089
<i>I...</i>

46
00:07:30,791 --> 00:07:32,891
<i>Okay. All right, all right,
all right, all right.</i>

47
00:07:32,893 --> 00:07:34,893
<i>I'm not moving.</i>

48
00:07:52,948 --> 00:07:55,315
<i>Oh, no, no, no. Come on.</i>

49
00:07:55,317 --> 00:07:56,685
<i>No, no, no.</i>

50
00:07:58,053 --> 00:08:00,653
<i>Come on... come on. Ah, shh.</i>

51
00:08:00,655 --> 00:08:04,058
<i>What is wrong with you?
Come on, let's go!</i>

52
00:08:16,672 --> 00:08:19,374
<i>Come on, come on,
come on, come on, come on.</i>

53
00:11:20,166 --> 00:11:23,535
<i>Okay, how about, uh...
we go analog, huh?</i>

54
00:11:23,537 --> 00:11:25,537
<i>- Little doo-doo-doo.
- There's a...</i>

55
00:11:25,539 --> 00:11:27,572
<i>There's a warm-up round
before AJ's?</i>

56
00:11:27,574 --> 00:11:29,274
<i>You guys, I got this for Nari
for her birthday</i>

57
00:11:29,276 --> 00:11:31,875
<i>because I guess
I'm trying to compensate.</i>

58
00:11:31,877 --> 00:11:34,279
<i>Rolling on the floor
laughing my ass off.</i>

59
00:11:34,281 --> 00:11:35,847
<i>All right. Um, uh...</i>

60
00:11:35,849 --> 00:11:38,116
<i>Hi, MTV.
My name is Kendra.</i>

61
00:11:38,118 --> 00:11:40,486
<i>I live in Malibu.

00:11:40,488 --> 00:11:42,320
<i>and I love to have a good time.</i>

63
00:11:42,322 --> 00:11:44,523
<i>Okay, Matias, do you wanna
go first and then...</i>

64
00:11:44,525 --> 00:11:47,892
<i>- Matias.
- Hi, my name is Kendra.</i>

65
00:11:47,894 --> 00:11:50,029
<i>I'm from Malibu.</i>

66
00:11:50,031 --> 00:11:53,032
<i>I'm into having sex
on top of a pizza</i>

67
00:11:53,034 --> 00:11:56,202
<i>and I love having
a really good time.</i>

68
00:11:56,204 --> 00:11:58,170
<i>Hi, my name is Kendra.
I'm from Malibu.</i>

69
00:11:58,172 --> 00:12:00,172
<i>I'm really into
the systematic destruction</i>

70
00:12:00,174 --> 00:12:02,275
<i>of an entire people
and their way of life...</i>

71
00:12:06,582 --> 00:12:09,251
<i>...and I'm ready
to have a good time.</i>

72
00:12:11,453 --> 00:12:13,587
<i>Uh, hi, my name is Kendra.</i>

73
00:12:13,589 --> 00:12:15,389
<i>I'm, uh, from Malibu,</i>

74
00:12:15,391 --> 00:12:19,126
<i>and I'm into snorting coke off
a clown's boner and...</i>

75
00:12:19,128 --> 00:12:21,329
<i>- What?
- ...I love having a good time.</i>

76
00:12:21,331 --> 00:12:26,067
<i>Matias, I can see the pores
on your face.</i>

77
00:12:26,069 --> 00:12:29,237
<i>- What is going on over there?
- But like in a good way.</i>

78
00:12:29,239 --> 00:12:32,340
<i>That actually looks like you're
calling from the year 2018.</i>

79
00:12:32,342 --> 00:12:34,342
<i>I mean, it's a full
30 frames a second.</i>

80
00:12:34,344 --> 00:12:35,977
<i>I don't think
you're ready for this.</i>

81
00:12:35,979 --> 00:12:37,412
<i>Oh, my God, and stereo even.</i>

82
00:12:37,414 --> 00:12:39,615
<i>I got a new laptop.</i>

83
00:12:39,617 --> 00:12:40,948
<i>What, actually new?</i>

84
00:12:40,950 --> 00:12:42,950
<i>Eh, it's, like, newish, yeah.</i>

85
00:12:42,952 --> 00:12:45,087
<i>- Yeah, Craigslist.
- Ow, ow!</i>

86
00:12:45,089 --> 00:12:48,223
<i>But unfortunately, like, everyone now, 'cause
they can see what he really looks like,</i>

87
00:12:48,225 --> 00:12:51,360
<i>everyone on Facebook's just
like, blup, unfriending him.</i>

88
00:12:51,362 --> 00:12:54,496
<i>Oi, so what? Are you guys gonna
come over or what?</i>

89
00:12:54,498 --> 00:12:56,365
<i>Um, we were gonna come over</i>

90
00:12:56,367 --> 00:12:58,100
<i>- but then, um...
- No!</i>

91
00:12:58,102 --> 00:13:00,503
<i>...I started having
some severe...</i>

92
00:13:00,505 --> 00:13:02,205
<i>- No!
- ...heartburn and...</i>

93
00:13:02,207 --> 00:13:04,074
<i>I told you
he was gonna do this.</i>

94
00:13:04,076 --> 00:13:05,575
<i>I never bail when it's
at one of yours.</i>

95
00:13:05,577 --> 00:13:06,676
<i>Lexx, come on,
help me out here.</i>

96
00:13:06,678 --> 00:13:07,944
<i>I mean, I'm cool with Skyping.</i>

97
00:13:07,946 --> 00:13:10,380
<i>It's subway and bus
from my place, so I'm...</i>

98
00:13:10,382 --> 00:13:11,448
<i>Skype clearly works for me...</i>

99
00:13:11,450 --> 00:13:14,050
<i>You guys are so old.</i>

100
00:13:14,052 --> 00:13:16,687
<i>AJ, it's... AJ, it's 3:00
in the morning in London.</i>

101
00:13:16,689 --> 00:13:18,456
<i>Damon stayed up just for you.</i>

102
00:13:18,458 --> 00:13:20,358
<i>Oh, come on, guys, guys,</i>

103
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:22,460
<i>I got chips and I've got dips</i>

104
00:13:22,462 --> 00:13:24,595
<i>and I, uh,</i>

105
00:13:24,597 --> 00:13:25,663
<i>I got some killer...</i>

106
00:13:25,665 --> 00:13:27,064
<i>I got some killer buds.</i>

107
00:13:27,066 --> 00:13:29,066
<i>Some what? Say that louder.</i>

108
00:13:29,068 --> 00:13:30,468
<i>What?</i>

109
00:13:30,470 --> 00:13:32,470
<i>What? What?</i>

110
00:13:32,472 --> 00:13:34,338
<i>I got some killer bud.</i>

111
00:13:34,340 --> 00:13:37,542
<i>Yeah, I know. I heard you. I
just wanted Linda to hear, too.</i>

112
00:13:37,544 --> 00:13:39,143
<i>She's not gonna...</i>

113
00:13:39,145 --> 00:13:42,014
<i>She still thinks marijuana
is illegal here.</i>

114
00:13:42,716 --> 00:13:45,150
<i>Uh, and also, Serena, hello,</i>

115
00:13:45,152 --> 00:13:46,485
<i>I sliced you a rabbit bowl.</i>

116
00:13:49,423 --> 00:13:50,424
<i>Really?</i>

117
00:14:47,083 --> 00:14:49,685
<i>And third, guys, how many times
do I have to tell you?</i>

118
00:14:49,687 --> 00:14:51,754
<i>It is not just the government.</i>

119
00:14:51,756 --> 00:14:54,723
<i>It is the circadians
and the Bilderbergs</i>

120
00:14:54,725 --> 00:14:57,159
<i>and the Illuminati
and corporations.</i>

121
00:14:57,161 --> 00:14:59,728
<i>Why do you think Facebook
and Twitter are free?</i>

122
00:14:59,730 --> 00:15:02,398
<i>- Because you're the product.
- 'Cause we're the product.</i>

123
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:05,635
<i>Yes! They own
every single thing you post!</i>

124
00:15:05,637 --> 00:15:07,303
<i>And everybody assumes that,</i>

125
00:15:07,305 --> 00:15:09,573
<i>"Oh, it's just...
it's just pictures and shit."</i>

126
00:15:09,575 --> 00:15:11,808
<i>All they really care about
is targeted marketing.</i>

127
00:15:11,810 --> 00:15:14,143
<i>But the Internet,
as you know it,</i>

128
00:15:14,145 --> 00:15:17,113
<i>is just the surface.
You guys are just like...</i>

129
00:15:17,115 --> 00:15:19,115
<i>Oh, you just float
around up there</i>

130
00:15:19,117 --> 00:15:21,284
<i>without a care in the world
but it is a...</i>

131
00:15:21,286 --> 00:15:24,120
<i>It is a...
it is a deep goddamn ocean</i>

132
00:15:24,122 --> 00:15:26,122
<i>and there are sharks
swimming below you.</i>

133
00:15:26,124 --> 00:15:28,158
<i>They're just gonna...
They're gonna come in</i>

134
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:30,828
<i>from right up behind you when
you don't even see it coming,</i>

135
00:15:30,830 --> 00:15:35,266
<i>and they're just... Hello?!</i>

136
00:15:35,268 --> 00:15:37,134
<i>No, no, I'm here.
I mean, keep going.</i>

137
00:15:37,136 --> 00:15:39,136
<i>Well, they're gonna come,
they're gonna get you,</i>

138
00:15:39,138 --> 00:15:41,138
<i>and then it's just sayonara,
you know.</i>

139
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:42,708
<i>It's... That's it!</i>

140
00:15:42,710 --> 00:15:44,408
<i>It's not just sharks
down there, guys.</i>

141
00:15:44,410 --> 00:15:48,145
<i>There are leviathans
and krakens and colossuses.</i>

142
00:15:48,147 --> 00:15:50,549
<i>Um, right, I believe the proper
plural is "colossi", mate.</i>

143
00:15:50,551 --> 00:15:54,820
<i>You know what,
Google "Skyhook," okay?</i>

144
00:15:54,822 --> 00:15:55,854
<i>You will shit yourself.</i>

145
00:15:55,856 --> 00:15:57,689
<i>It is total integration</i>

146
00:15:57,691 --> 00:16:00,158
<i>of Wi-Fi and cell towers,</i>

147
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:02,294
<i>GPS, IP address detection,</i>

148
00:16:02,296 --> 00:16:04,129
<i>Bluetooth device tracking,</i>

149
00:16:04,131 --> 00:16:05,264
<i>even those Fitbit things</i>

150
00:16:05,266 --> 00:16:06,699
<i>you like to run around with,</i>

151
00:16:06,701 --> 00:16:08,635
<i>they can track you
through that.</i>

152
00:16:08,637 --> 00:16:10,303
<i>What are you doing, Lexx?</i>

153
00:16:10,305 --> 00:16:11,704
<i>Come on.</i>

154
00:16:11,706 --> 00:16:13,172
<i>Stop it. That's not funny.</i>

155
00:16:13,174 --> 00:16:14,374
<i>Well played. Well played.</i>

156
00:16:14,376 --> 00:16:18,645
<i>It's not funny, Serena.</i>

157
00:16:18,647 --> 00:16:19,880
<i>Help me!</i>

158
00:16:19,882 --> 00:16:22,315
<i>I just want to...</i>

159
00:16:22,317 --> 00:16:24,552
<i>...get it through your heads!</i>

160
00:16:24,554 --> 00:16:26,022
<i>Oh.</i>

161
00:16:28,457 --> 00:16:29,490
<i>Someday.</i>

162
00:16:29,492 --> 00:16:30,591
<i>Someday what?</i>

163
00:16:30,593 --> 00:16:32,860
<i>You hope we get eaten?</i>

164
00:16:32,862 --> 00:16:34,828
<i>No, actually,
I really hope you don't.</i>

165
00:16:34,830 --> 00:16:36,463
<i>Aw, you're worried!</i>

166
00:16:36,465 --> 00:16:38,867
<i>Like a big, ol' cuddly
teddy bear, huh?</i>

167
00:16:38,869 --> 00:16:41,235
<i>Yeah, a teddy bear
in a survivalist bunker</i>

168
00:16:41,237 --> 00:16:42,957
<i>with a year's supply
of food, guns and ammo.</i>

169
00:16:47,878 --> 00:16:49,311
<i>Oh.</i>

170
00:16:49,313 --> 00:16:52,247
<i>No! No!</i>

171
00:16:52,249 --> 00:16:54,516
<i>No...</i>

172
00:16:54,518 --> 00:16:57,285
<i>- What was that?
- That was my...</i>

173
00:16:57,287 --> 00:17:01,657
<i>That's my impression of Nari
being attacked by a dick.</i>

174
00:17:01,659 --> 00:17:03,394
<i>Oh, right.</i>

175
00:17:07,398 --> 00:17:08,898
<i>Yes. Aw!</i>

176
00:17:25,451 --> 00:17:29,286
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

177
00:17:29,288 --> 00:17:30,589
<i>Is no one offended by...</i>

178
00:18:26,682 --> 00:18:28,515
<i>Oh, wait, oh, wait!
Oh, wait! Uh, hold on.</i>

179
00:18:28,517 --> 00:18:30,017
<i>I'm gonna play it now, okay?
Check it out.</i>

180
00:18:30,019 --> 00:18:31,986
<i>I just got these new speakers.</i>

181
00:18:34,556 --> 00:18:36,322
<i>Turn it down!</i>

182
00:18:36,324 --> 00:18:38,793
<i>- AJ, turn it down!
- All right. All right.</i>

183
00:18:38,795 --> 00:18:40,661
<i>All right. All right.
Hold on, hold on. Hold on.</i>

184
00:18:40,663 --> 00:18:42,697
<i>You guys see that, though?
Look at my new box.</i>

185
00:18:42,699 --> 00:18:43,998
<i>Bam! Bam!</i>

186
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,434
<i>Bam! Yeah, right?</i>

187
00:18:46,436 --> 00:18:48,937
<i>You would love the way your
shit sounds up close, Lexx,</i>

188
00:18:48,939 --> 00:18:51,439
<i>or you would if you were
comin' over but you're not.</i>

189
00:18:51,441 --> 00:18:53,942
<i>I can't. Subway and bus
from my place, remember that?</i>

190
00:18:53,944 --> 00:18:56,745
<i>Before we start,
there is something</i>

191
00:18:56,747 --> 00:18:58,847
<i>that we wanna tell you guys.</i>

192
00:18:58,849 --> 00:19:00,382
<i>- Oh, wait, wait, wait!
- Ooh.</i>

193
00:19:00,384 --> 00:19:01,550
<i>Should we wait for Amaya?</i>

194
00:19:01,552 --> 00:19:03,587
<i>I don't think Amaya's
gonna be comin'.</i>

195
00:19:06,057 --> 00:19:09,959
<i>- Bam!
- Oh, yeah!</i>

196
00:19:09,961 --> 00:19:11,426
<i>Bam!</i>

197
00:19:11,428 --> 00:19:13,696
<i>Bam!</i>

198
00:19:13,698 --> 00:19:15,498
<i>- That is amazing.
- Can I... Can I see it?</i>

199
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:17,900
<i>- Closer. Closer.
- Closer, closer, closer!</i>

200
00:19:17,902 --> 00:19:19,368
<i>I wanna see it.</i>

201
00:19:19,370 --> 00:19:21,003
<i>- Oh, it's great.
- Wow!</i>

202
00:19:21,005 --> 00:19:22,638
<i>I am so happy for you guys.</i>

203
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:24,307
<i>- She asked me.
- Okay, no, no, no, no, wait,</i>

204
00:19:24,309 --> 00:19:26,309
<i>you gotta tell us everything.</i>

205
00:19:26,311 --> 00:19:29,378
<i>I was having my morning cup
of inspirational tea</i>

206
00:19:29,380 --> 00:19:31,982
<i>and I swig back
the little last bit of it.</i>

207
00:19:31,984 --> 00:19:34,017
<i>Basically,
I almost choke on this</i>

208
00:19:34,019 --> 00:19:35,318
<i>because it was in the cup.</i>

209
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:37,788
<i>Were you just watching her
drink it the whole time,</i>

210
00:19:37,790 --> 00:19:39,690
<i>just going like,
"She's gonna find it soon."</i>

211
00:19:39,692 --> 00:19:42,359
<i>Well, yeah. But... she puts
milk in her tea, you know.</i>

212
00:19:42,361 --> 00:19:44,394
<i>- So it's like cloudy.
- Awesome, guys.</i>

213
00:19:44,396 --> 00:19:45,897
<i>It's my mom's ring.</i>

214
00:19:45,899 --> 00:19:47,932
<i>- It's your mom's ring?
- Aw! That's, aw, that's...</i>

215
00:19:47,934 --> 00:19:49,734
<i>Oh, my God!
Did you... Wait, did you, uh,</i>

216
00:19:49,736 --> 00:19:52,436
<i>did you ask Nari's dad for
permission and did you film it?</i>

217
00:19:52,438 --> 00:19:54,706
<i>Please say you did because
oh, my God, I just...</i>

218
00:19:54,708 --> 00:19:56,941
<i>I loved the look on his face
when he found out</i>

219
00:19:56,943 --> 00:19:59,577
<i>that you two weren't,
uh, roommates and I just...</i>

220
00:19:59,579 --> 00:20:01,346
<i>I would really
love to see that.</i>

221
00:20:01,348 --> 00:20:02,714
<i>AJ, it's not the time.</i>

222
00:20:02,716 --> 00:20:03,983
<i>It was cool when you
stood up to him,</i>

223
00:20:03,985 --> 00:20:07,352
<i>that's all I'm sayin'.
It was just sweet.</i>

224
00:20:07,354 --> 00:20:09,891
<i>Serena, is your...
Is your mom excited?</i>

225
00:20:11,492 --> 00:20:15,094
<i>- Yeah, she's really excited.
- Cool.</i>

226
00:20:15,096 --> 00:20:18,432
<i>I just, um...
You know...</i>

227
00:20:21,602 --> 00:20:24,637
<i>Uh, the cancer has progressed,
so it's...</i>

228
00:20:24,639 --> 00:20:27,573
<i>It's... um,</i>

229
00:20:27,575 --> 00:20:29,543
<i>it's moved
into her brain and,</i>

230
00:20:29,545 --> 00:20:31,444
<i>uh, they have her
on life support, though,</i>

231
00:20:31,446 --> 00:20:33,780
<i>and they're really trying
some aggressive treatment,</i>

232
00:20:33,782 --> 00:20:34,850
<i>so it's...</i>

233
00:20:36,919 --> 00:20:38,451
<i>I wish I'd asked her sooner</i>

234
00:20:38,453 --> 00:20:40,789
<i>so we just had more time,
you know.</i>

235
00:20:42,724 --> 00:20:45,627
<i>I remember when
I had to put my dog down.</i>

236
00:20:54,470 --> 00:20:56,938
<i>Oh, my God.
You're so bad at this.</i>

237
00:20:56,940 --> 00:21:00,008
<i>I am so... No, I am so thrilled
for you guys, you have no idea.</i>

238
00:21:00,010 --> 00:21:03,812
<i>I always thought Matias and
Amaya would be the first to...</i>

239
00:21:06,050 --> 00:21:09,151
<i>Nice recovery, mate,
but still it sucks.</i>

240
00:21:09,153 --> 00:21:11,420
<i>Well, oh!
And hey, um, by the way,</i>

241
00:21:11,422 --> 00:21:13,856
<i>by the way...</i>

242
00:21:15,893 --> 00:21:16,993
<i>What is that sound?</i>

243
00:21:16,995 --> 00:21:18,594
<i>Universal Life Church,</i>

244
00:21:18,596 --> 00:21:20,163
<i>fully certified,
took five minutes online,</i>

245
00:21:20,165 --> 00:21:21,965
<i>I can totally marry you guys,
that's right.</i>

246
00:21:21,967 --> 00:21:23,766
<i>That says "wedding officiant"?</i>

247
00:21:23,768 --> 00:21:25,535
<i>- Yep.
- Yeah, there's nothing</i>

248
00:21:25,537 --> 00:21:27,203
<i>more romantic
than being married</i>

249
00:21:27,205 --> 00:21:29,138
<i>by the last guy
you ever slept with.</i>

250
00:21:29,140 --> 00:21:31,776
<i>Uh, that is the only guy, Lexx.</i>

251
00:21:34,113 --> 00:21:35,812
<i>Nari?</i>

252
00:21:35,814 --> 00:21:37,680
<i>Ooh!</i>

253
00:21:37,682 --> 00:21:38,682
<i>Nari?</i>

254
00:21:39,986 --> 00:21:41,653
<i>Nari...</i>

255
00:21:45,224 --> 00:21:46,790
<i>No, no.</i>

256
00:21:46,792 --> 00:21:48,626
<i>No.</i>

257
00:21:56,003 --> 00:21:59,170
<i>This is Amaya's
favorite sunset spot.</i>

258
00:22:09,217 --> 00:22:10,749
<i>What?</i>

259
00:22:51,261 --> 00:22:53,794
<i>Hi.</i>

260
00:22:53,796 --> 00:22:56,697
<i>Look, I know... I know you're mad
at me, and I know, we've both...</i>

261
00:22:56,699 --> 00:22:58,600
<i>we've both been busy,
but I feel like...</i>

262
00:23:01,705 --> 00:23:04,138
<i>I know, I... I've been spending</i>

263
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:05,274
<i>a lot of time on this app,</i>

264
00:23:05,276 --> 00:23:07,075
<i>but I've been doing it</i>

265
00:23:07,077 --> 00:23:08,743
<i>so that we can...</i>

266
00:23:08,745 --> 00:23:10,480
<i>So that we can
communicate better.</i>

267
00:23:16,187 --> 00:23:17,788
<i>Amaya.</i>

268
00:23:34,973 --> 00:23:38,577
<i>I went... I went
to the ASL class, uh...</i>

269
00:23:45,784 --> 00:23:47,519
<i>No. No, I'm just, uh...</i>

270
00:23:55,228 --> 00:23:56,963
<i>Uh, Amaya!</i>

271
00:24:09,609 --> 00:24:10,811
<i>Damn it.</i>

272
00:26:03,897 --> 00:26:05,796
<i>Hey, guys,
I'm gonna head out real quick.</i>

273
00:26:05,798 --> 00:26:07,865
<i>Uh, what's up?
Where are you going?</i>

274
00:26:07,867 --> 00:26:10,835
<i>Yeah, yeah.
Yeah, I'll explain later.</i>

275
00:26:10,837 --> 00:26:12,203
<i>All right. Bye then.</i>

276
00:26:12,205 --> 00:26:14,473
<i>Is everything okay, Matias?</i>

277
00:26:14,475 --> 00:26:17,209
<i>Uh, sometimes that guy.</i>

278
00:26:17,211 --> 00:26:21,182
<i>I believe in the truth
and Damon believes in the lies.</i>

279
00:26:22,816 --> 00:26:24,783
<i>Damon believes
in the hard lies</i>

280
00:26:24,785 --> 00:26:27,419
<i>and I believe
in the crazy truth.</i>

281
00:27:46,170 --> 00:27:48,037
<i>All right.
No, no, it's not impossible,</i>

282
00:27:48,039 --> 00:27:49,473
<i>it's just...
it is improbable, but...</i>

283
00:27:49,475 --> 00:27:51,841
<i>Thank you, Captain Spock.</i>

284
00:27:51,843 --> 00:27:53,909
<i>Uh, that is Ambassador Spock.</i>

285
00:27:53,911 --> 00:27:55,612
<i>And we are nothing
without our chain of command.</i>

286
00:27:55,614 --> 00:27:59,850
<i>Hah, you're such a nerd, dude.</i>

287
00:27:59,852 --> 00:28:02,286
<i>Hey, what the hell?</i>

288
00:28:02,288 --> 00:28:04,988
<i>Sounds like someone
is meditating or something.</i>

289
00:28:04,990 --> 00:28:07,124
<i>Matias, are you okay?</i>

290
00:28:07,126 --> 00:28:08,925
<i>I thought you
were going somewhere.</i>

291
00:28:08,927 --> 00:28:10,328
<i>What's goin' on?</i>

292
00:28:22,976 --> 00:28:25,243
<i>Mate, Matias, what's going on?</i>

293
00:28:25,245 --> 00:28:27,914
<i>Do you wanna share...
share your screen, mate?</i>

294
00:28:31,918 --> 00:28:35,254
<i>Whoa! That looks like the
wallpaper's actually moving.</i>

295
00:28:35,256 --> 00:28:37,556
<i>Yeah, it is.
It switched when I connected.</i>

296
00:28:37,558 --> 00:28:39,325
<i>Connected to what?</i>

297
00:28:39,327 --> 00:28:42,330
<i>I, uh, I have no idea,
this river thing.</i>

298
00:28:44,065 --> 00:28:46,232
<i>All right.
That's an overlay network.</i>

299
00:28:46,234 --> 00:28:48,067
<i>You've been bouncing it
everywhere.</i>

300
00:28:48,069 --> 00:28:50,270
<i>- What's an overlay network?
- Uh, hey, Damon,</i>

301
00:28:50,272 --> 00:28:52,305
<i>Damon, you gotta
translate that, man.</i>

302
00:28:52,307 --> 00:28:54,441
<i>Oh, um, sorry, uh,</i>

303
00:28:54,443 --> 00:28:56,609
<i>it's so no one can track you.</i>

304
00:28:56,611 --> 00:28:58,278
<i>Shit! This is...</i>

305
00:28:58,280 --> 00:29:01,247
<i>- Dude, this is darknet.
- Yeah, probably.</i>

306
00:29:01,249 --> 00:29:03,451
<i>- Damon, what's darknet?
- Uh, it is part of the Internet</i>

307
00:29:03,453 --> 00:29:06,454
<i>that isn't or can't be
indexed by a search engine.</i>

308
00:29:06,456 --> 00:29:09,023
<i>It's where you find marketplaces
for bad shit, basically,</i>

309
00:29:09,025 --> 00:29:11,292
<i>like, um, Silk Road.
Damon, you know about that.</i>

310
00:29:11,294 --> 00:29:12,960
<i>It was all about drugs,
illegal IDs,</i>

311
00:29:12,962 --> 00:29:14,328
<i>stolen credit cards, exploits,</i>

312
00:29:14,330 --> 00:29:15,930
<i>even assassination for hire.</i>

313
00:29:15,932 --> 00:29:17,198
<i>Lolita City,
which is all about child porn</i>

314
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:19,333
<i>- and, like, fan fiction...
- Okay, AJ, we got it.</i>

315
00:29:19,335 --> 00:29:21,403
<i>- Yeah, definitely... yeah.
- Yeah, maybe you should</i>

316
00:29:21,405 --> 00:29:23,940
<i>just leave whatever
that is alone, Matias.</i>

317
00:29:28,712 --> 00:29:30,178
<i>Oh, whoa! Okay.</i>

318
00:29:30,180 --> 00:29:32,280
<i>It looks like
an old-school PBS.</i>

319
00:29:32,282 --> 00:29:35,052
<i>Charon is the ferryman
of the dead.</i>

320
00:29:40,991 --> 00:29:43,393
<i>"The ferryman of Hades

322
00:29:46,231 --> 00:29:48,364
<i>Styx, sorry.</i>

323
00:29:48,366 --> 00:29:50,199
<i>"...and Acheron that divides</i>

<i>the world of the living

00:29:56,474 --> 00:29:58,475
<i>Dude, whose computer
did you buy?</i>

326
00:29:58,477 --> 00:30:02,111
<i>I didn't... I didn't buy it. I...</i>

327
00:30:02,113 --> 00:30:05,014
<i>There's, um, there's a cyber
cafe that I've been...</i>

328
00:30:05,016 --> 00:30:07,718
<i>that I've been working at
and I... I don't know,</i>

329
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:08,986
<i>and I noticed this computer</i>

330
00:30:08,988 --> 00:30:12,122
<i>was sitting in the lost
and found for the last,</i>

331
00:30:12,124 --> 00:30:14,091
<i>I don't know, three or...
three or four weeks.</i>

332
00:30:14,093 --> 00:30:16,293
<i>Wait, well, hang on,
you stole someone's computer?</i>

333
00:30:16,295 --> 00:30:18,295
<i>No, I didn't...
I didn't steal it, I just...</i>

334
00:30:18,297 --> 00:30:20,365
<i>Hold on, mate. You told me
you bought it on Craigslist.</i>

335
00:30:20,367 --> 00:30:22,200
<i>I felt like shit
the moment I took it.</i>

336
00:30:22,202 --> 00:30:23,635
<i>I don't know
what I was hoping for.</i>

337
00:30:23,637 --> 00:30:25,403
<i>I just... I kept having
to go there</i>

338
00:30:25,405 --> 00:30:28,139
<i>because I wanted a better
computer to work on my app with</i>

339
00:30:28,141 --> 00:30:31,075
<i>and then my thing was just
moving so goddamn slow</i>

340
00:30:31,077 --> 00:30:33,344
<i>that I thought whoever's
laptop this was, I mean...</i>

341
00:30:33,346 --> 00:30:37,115
<i>But look here, look,
when I... I went on Facebook,</i>

342
00:30:37,117 --> 00:30:39,117
<i>all of this stuff auto-filled.</i>

343
00:30:39,119 --> 00:30:42,555
<i>Norah C. IV, oh!</i>

344
00:30:43,591 --> 00:30:45,324
<i>Pretentious twat.</i>

345
00:30:45,326 --> 00:30:47,293
<i>Only an elitist asshat
would have that kind of name.</i>

346
00:30:47,295 --> 00:30:49,495
<i>Oh, yeah, okay,
Alistair Jeffcock.</i>

347
00:30:49,497 --> 00:30:53,466
<i>Hey, Jeffcock
is a family name, Lexx.</i>

348
00:30:53,468 --> 00:30:54,701
<i>Oh, yeah.</i>

349
00:30:54,703 --> 00:30:56,235
<i>It's a fake name.</i>

350
00:30:56,237 --> 00:31:00,574
<i>Guys, it's "Charon" backwards.</i>

351
00:31:00,576 --> 00:31:03,243
<i>Charon IV, Charon IV, yeah.</i>

352
00:31:03,245 --> 00:31:05,245
<i>He's one of them.
He's one of them,</i>

353
00:31:05,247 --> 00:31:07,080
<i>and whoever they are,
they must...</i>

354
00:31:07,082 --> 00:31:10,585
<i>This is where they meet up
to trade.</i>

355
00:31:10,587 --> 00:31:13,220
<i>Trade what?</i>

356
00:31:13,222 --> 00:31:15,121
<i>Well, one of them
was actually sending me</i>

357
00:31:15,123 --> 00:31:16,189
<i>private messages earlier.</i>

358
00:31:16,191 --> 00:31:19,260
<i>It was, uh, Charon68.</i>

359
00:31:19,262 --> 00:31:21,596
<i>Oh, the poor schmuck
never made it to 69.</i>

360
00:31:21,598 --> 00:31:23,598
<i>Yeah, here.</i>

361
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:27,101
<i>"Just processed the transfer.
You'll have it soon."</i>

362
00:31:27,103 --> 00:31:30,404
<i>It's like he's placing an order for
something he already paid for.</i>

363
00:31:30,406 --> 00:31:32,508
<i>Matias, go back
to the beginning.</i>

364
00:31:32,510 --> 00:31:34,275
<i>Well, the computer
was acting strangely,</i>

365
00:31:34,277 --> 00:31:35,811
<i>so I ran a Disk Utility
and it said</i>

366
00:31:35,813 --> 00:31:38,413
<i>the drive was full, so...</i>

367
00:31:38,415 --> 00:31:40,382
<i>I was lookin' around
and I found this, uh,</i>

368
00:31:40,384 --> 00:31:42,317
<i>this folder, right?
It was...</i>

369
00:31:42,319 --> 00:31:45,320
<i>hidden, invisible,
and it's got videos.</i>

370
00:31:45,322 --> 00:31:47,626
<i>- Nine hundred and sixty gig...
- Show us.</i>

371
00:31:51,161 --> 00:31:53,530
<i>No, wait, wait, wait.
Look at those addresses.</i>

372
00:31:53,532 --> 00:31:54,797
<i>That's here, that's...</i>

373
00:31:54,799 --> 00:31:57,600
<i>the ones on the east side,
and...</i>

374
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:05,441
<i>I think it's okay.</i>

375
00:32:05,443 --> 00:32:07,243
<i>- He's been wardriving.
- Totally.</i>

376
00:32:07,245 --> 00:32:08,812
<i>- Translate, guys.
- Um, okay, hackers drive</i>

377
00:32:08,814 --> 00:32:10,481
<i>through neighborhoods,
trying to scoop out</i>

378
00:32:10,483 --> 00:32:12,248
<i>Wi-Fi addresses
of any unsecured</i>

379
00:32:12,250 --> 00:32:14,818
<i>or vulnerable routers
so they can...</i>

380
00:32:14,820 --> 00:32:16,587
<i>Hackers can activate
the camera on laptops</i>

381
00:32:16,589 --> 00:32:18,455
<i>and phones and disable
the indicator lights</i>

382
00:32:18,457 --> 00:32:20,224
<i>so you wouldn't even know
that they were on.</i>

383
00:32:20,226 --> 00:32:22,192
<i>- Oh!
- Even the director of the FBI</i>

384
00:32:22,194 --> 00:32:24,194
<i>- says he keeps his covered.
- Yeah, so think about that</i>

385
00:32:24,196 --> 00:32:26,230
<i>next time you're servicing
your porn addiction, AJ.</i>

386
00:32:26,232 --> 00:32:28,733
<i>- So this guy's good.
- Yeah, this takes mad skills.</i>

387
00:32:28,735 --> 00:32:31,103
<i>He might be a goddamn maestro.</i>

388
00:32:33,874 --> 00:32:36,441
<i>Oh, more like a goddamn psycho.</i>

389
00:32:36,443 --> 00:32:38,610
<i>- Yeah.
- Hey, did you open that link</i>

390
00:32:38,612 --> 00:32:40,614
<i>in the folder,
the one called "Account?"</i>

391
00:32:55,163 --> 00:32:57,697
<i>Wait, that... that's just
from a couple of minutes ago.</i>

392
00:32:57,699 --> 00:33:00,499
<i>Bitcoin, that's not
a real currency, right?</i>

393
00:33:00,501 --> 00:33:03,904
<i>It's cryptocurrency.
No middleman, no banks.</i>

394
00:33:03,906 --> 00:33:05,507
<i>It's 10 million.</i>

395
00:33:08,410 --> 00:33:11,345
<i>That's $10 million, guys.</i>

396
00:33:11,347 --> 00:33:13,380
<i>Whoa, wait,
this is a joke, right?</i>

397
00:33:13,382 --> 00:33:16,918
<i>Um, dude, are you... Are you
being serious right now or...</i>

398
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:21,521
<i>All right, the exchange rate
right now is 663.02</i>

399
00:33:21,523 --> 00:33:22,824
<i>per XPT</i>

400
00:33:22,826 --> 00:33:29,297
<i>- times 16,263.52.
- Yep.</i>

401
00:33:29,299 --> 00:33:30,598
<i>- Yep.
- Ten million change.</i>

402
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:34,869
<i>Yep, 10 million.</i>

403
00:33:34,871 --> 00:33:36,939
<i>- Do you see that?
- It's almost 11.</i>

404
00:33:36,941 --> 00:33:38,673
<i>Free money
just sitting there.</i>

405
00:33:38,675 --> 00:33:41,677
<i>No, no, there's no such thing
as free money, AJ.</i>

406
00:33:41,679 --> 00:33:42,799
<i>I hate to burst your bubble.</i>

407
00:33:52,323 --> 00:33:54,690
<i>He's talking about the money.</i>

408
00:33:54,692 --> 00:33:55,726
<i>Then say something.</i>

409
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:03,535
<i>Wait, wait, don't...</i>

410
00:34:13,712 --> 00:34:15,681
<i>Type, uh, "For what?"</i>

411
00:34:27,627 --> 00:34:29,660
<i>Hello, hair.
He's talking about hair.</i>

412
00:34:29,662 --> 00:34:32,632
<i>AJ, for once in your life,
just put a cork in it.</i>

413
00:34:40,273 --> 00:34:42,676
<i>Method... what's he...</i>

414
00:34:52,921 --> 00:34:54,388
<i>What is that?</i>

415
00:35:01,629 --> 00:35:05,698
<i>"A surgical procedure
in which a hole is...</i>

416
00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:09,002
<i>drilled into the skull."</i>

417
00:35:09,004 --> 00:35:10,739
<i>Oh, my God, this is...</i>

418
00:35:16,912 --> 00:35:19,079
<i>Oh, shit!</i>

419
00:35:19,081 --> 00:35:21,782
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

420
00:35:21,784 --> 00:35:24,918
<i>Oh!</i>

421
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:26,587
<i>No, no, no, no, Matias!</i>

422
00:35:26,589 --> 00:35:28,522
<i>- Matias!
- Just shut it off!</i>

423
00:35:28,524 --> 00:35:30,357
<i>Matias, shut it off!</i>

424
00:35:30,359 --> 00:35:31,599
<i>All right, all right,
all right!</i>

425
00:35:42,939 --> 00:35:44,407
<i>That's him, isn't it?</i>

426
00:35:49,679 --> 00:35:51,314
<i>Don't answer.</i>

427
00:35:53,450 --> 00:35:55,584
<i>Contributions?</i>

428
00:35:55,586 --> 00:35:57,419
<i>Charon 68,
the first thing he wrote</i>

429
00:35:57,421 --> 00:36:00,122
<i>was that he liked
the last contribution.</i>

430
00:36:00,124 --> 00:36:01,690
<i>Um, go back to the video folder</i>

431
00:36:01,692 --> 00:36:04,094
<i>and scroll all the way
to the bottom.</i>

432
00:36:04,096 --> 00:36:07,663
<i>Just go all the way down.</i>

433
00:36:07,665 --> 00:36:10,100
<i>No, Matias,
don't open it, please.</i>

434
00:36:10,102 --> 00:36:11,770
<i>- Just...
- No, just open.</i>

435
00:36:14,740 --> 00:36:16,608
<i>No, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, I don't...</i>

436
00:37:18,940 --> 00:37:20,508
<i>Oh, God.</i>

437
00:37:25,181 --> 00:37:26,881
<i>Uh, no, no, no, no, okay.</i>

438
00:37:26,883 --> 00:37:28,749
<i>- No, I can't... I can't...
- Oh, God.</i>

439
00:37:28,751 --> 00:37:30,217
<i>Out of this one,
out of this one.</i>

440
00:37:30,219 --> 00:37:31,821
<i>I can't watch that.</i>

441
00:37:58,249 --> 00:38:00,849
<i>Okay, these are
custom videos, these are...</i>

442
00:38:00,851 --> 00:38:02,852
<i>Guys, that's what
they're trading.</i>

443
00:38:02,854 --> 00:38:04,954
<i>AJ, I don't...
I don't... I don't...</i>

444
00:38:04,956 --> 00:38:08,693
<i>No, no, this is... Okay.</i>

445
00:38:11,696 --> 00:38:13,195
<i>Show me the most recent one.</i>

446
00:38:13,197 --> 00:38:14,565
<i>Nari.</i>

447
00:38:16,868 --> 00:38:18,601
<i>The last one,
it's a small file.</i>

448
00:38:18,603 --> 00:38:19,970
<i>It's smaller
than the other ones.</i>

449
00:38:19,972 --> 00:38:22,172
<i>Oh, Jesus.</i>

450
00:38:22,174 --> 00:38:25,676
<i>Just open it.</i>

451
00:38:25,678 --> 00:38:26,912
<i>Okay.</i>

452
00:38:39,658 --> 00:38:40,860
<i>Wait, wait, stop.</i>

453
00:38:42,996 --> 00:38:44,764
<i>This can't be real.</i>

454
00:38:55,709 --> 00:38:58,177
<i>Matias, go to the end.</i>

455
00:38:58,179 --> 00:38:59,646
<i>Go all the way to the end.</i>

456
00:39:07,288 --> 00:39:09,890
<i>Why is he looking
at the camera?</i>

457
00:39:14,929 --> 00:39:16,795
<i>- That was it, right?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.</i>

458
00:39:16,797 --> 00:39:18,697
<i>Well, then he might not
have her yet.</i>

459
00:39:18,699 --> 00:39:20,000
<i>She's still in her bedroom,</i>

460
00:39:20,002 --> 00:39:21,968
<i>all the other girls weren't.</i>

461
00:39:21,970 --> 00:39:23,937
<i>Look, he chooses a girl,</i>

462
00:39:23,939 --> 00:39:25,572
<i>shows her to the rest
of the group,</i>

463
00:39:25,574 --> 00:39:27,874
<i>and waits for someone to pay.</i>

464
00:39:27,876 --> 00:39:29,709
<i>And someone just paid,
so this is...</i>

465
00:39:29,711 --> 00:39:31,745
<i>- this is the next girl.
- We have to report this, Nari.</i>

466
00:39:31,747 --> 00:39:33,646
<i>Oh, we have her address
so just we can do</i>

467
00:39:33,648 --> 00:39:35,648
<i>- a reverse phone look-up?
- Guys, I'll be right back,</i>

468
00:39:35,650 --> 00:39:37,051
<i>- I'll be right back.
- Matias!</i>

469
00:39:38,721 --> 00:39:40,187
<i>Matias, I'm not...</i>

470
00:39:40,189 --> 00:39:41,789
<i>Look, please, I'm not...
No,</i>

471
00:39:41,791 --> 00:39:43,593
<i>please just give me
one second.</i>

472
00:39:51,068 --> 00:39:52,300
<i>Hello, hello!</i>

473
00:39:53,904 --> 00:39:55,005
<i>Hello!</i>

474
00:40:00,277 --> 00:40:02,077
<i>Kelly?</i>

475
00:40:02,079 --> 00:40:03,345
<i>Kelly!</i>

476
00:40:03,347 --> 00:40:04,748
<i>Kelly!</i>

477
00:40:07,684 --> 00:40:11,120
<i>Hey! Hey, hold on, one second.</i>

478
00:40:11,122 --> 00:40:13,022
<i>Hello?</i>

479
00:40:13,024 --> 00:40:15,825
<i>Uh, yeah, we did.</i>

480
00:40:15,827 --> 00:40:17,693
<i>Okay. Well,</i>

481
00:40:17,695 --> 00:40:20,663
<i>he must have figured it out
'cause we got him.</i>

482
00:40:20,665 --> 00:40:22,365
<i>Yeah, sure thing.</i>

483
00:40:22,367 --> 00:40:25,335
<i>Thanks.</i>

484
00:40:25,337 --> 00:40:27,036
<i>Sorry, that was
the pizza place.</i>

485
00:40:27,038 --> 00:40:28,938
<i>I guess the driver called,
couldn't figure out</i>

486
00:40:28,940 --> 00:40:32,910
<i>where we were or something,
I don't know. Hi!</i>

487
00:40:32,912 --> 00:40:35,245
<i>- Is, um, is Amaya with you right now?
- No.</i>

488
00:40:35,247 --> 00:40:36,814
<i>I mean, I just got in,</i>

489
00:40:36,816 --> 00:40:39,316
<i>and I think Amaya's
in the shower.</i>

490
00:40:39,318 --> 00:40:41,218
<i>Well, can you possibly get her
for me right now?</i>

491
00:40:41,220 --> 00:40:42,886
<i>- Oh, wow! What?
- Uh...</i>

492
00:40:42,888 --> 00:40:44,721
<i>- Okay, are you there?
- Hello, hello?</i>

493
00:40:44,723 --> 00:40:45,989
<i>I can hear you.
Are you still there?</i>

494
00:40:45,991 --> 00:40:47,958
<i>- I just can't...
- Kelly, I can't see you.</i>

495
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:49,726
<i>- I can't see you.
- Uh, where'd you go?</i>

496
00:40:49,728 --> 00:40:51,029
<i>- Hold on a second.
- Yeah, is that</i>

497
00:40:51,031 --> 00:40:53,031
<i>- on your end or...
- No, I think it's my end.</i>

498
00:40:53,033 --> 00:40:55,834
<i>Yeah, sorry, hold on.</i>

499
00:40:55,836 --> 00:40:58,336
<i>God! God! Kelly!</i>

500
00:40:58,338 --> 00:40:59,938
<i>Kelly!</i>

501
00:40:59,940 --> 00:41:00,941
<i>Kelly!</i>

502
00:41:05,879 --> 00:41:06,879
<i>Kelly!</i>

503
00:41:48,858 --> 00:41:50,059
<i>Wait, wait, wait, wait.</i>

504
00:42:09,213 --> 00:42:10,412
<i>Amaya, Amaya, Amaya,</i>

505
00:42:10,414 --> 00:42:12,781
<i>Amaya, Amaya, Amaya!</i>

506
00:42:12,783 --> 00:42:14,752
<i>Hey! Come here, come here!</i>

507
00:42:20,192 --> 00:42:22,225
<i>Can you see...</i>

508
00:42:22,227 --> 00:42:25,228
<i>Amaya, Amaya, Amaya!</i>

509
00:42:25,230 --> 00:42:26,963
<i>Don't go in there,
don't go in there,</i>

510
00:42:26,965 --> 00:42:29,832
<i>don't go in there,
don't go... don't...</i>

511
00:42:29,834 --> 00:42:31,501
<i>stop, stop, stop!</i>

512
00:42:31,503 --> 00:42:33,436
<i>Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.</i>

513
00:42:33,438 --> 00:42:34,971
<i>Come here, come here,
come here.</i>

514
00:42:34,973 --> 00:42:37,173
<i>Come here, come here.
Good, good.</i>

515
00:42:37,175 --> 00:42:40,244
<i>Shit. I... it must...
it must be a bug,</i>

516
00:42:40,246 --> 00:42:42,546
<i>or something.
Your computer called mine.</i>

517
00:42:42,548 --> 00:42:46,317
<i>Um, uh, Kelly, Kelly's, um,</i>

518
00:42:46,319 --> 00:42:50,521
<i>She's... she brought a...
she brought a guy home.</i>

519
00:42:50,523 --> 00:42:53,257
<i>He's... she's... don't, don't,</i>

520
00:42:53,259 --> 00:42:54,992
<i>don't disconnect.</i>

521
00:42:54,994 --> 00:42:57,029
<i>I'll wait for you.
I'll wait... I'll wait for you.</i>

522
00:43:09,076 --> 00:43:10,141
<i>Hey!</i>

523
00:43:10,143 --> 00:43:11,144
<i>Hey!</i>

524
00:43:27,328 --> 00:43:30,296
<i>Can you please sit down?</i>

525
00:43:47,216 --> 00:43:49,049
<i>Please, please, just please
don't hurt her.</i>

526
00:43:49,051 --> 00:43:50,418
<i>I'll do anything
you want me to do,</i>

527
00:43:50,420 --> 00:43:52,286
<i>I will do anything, I promise.</i>

528
00:43:59,929 --> 00:44:01,364
<i>How are you doing that?</i>

529
00:44:18,516 --> 00:44:21,852
<i>How can I give... I can't give
you the laptop if I can't...</i>

530
00:44:33,064 --> 00:44:36,566
<i>Wait just one second,
could you wait?</i>

531
00:44:36,568 --> 00:44:38,403
God.

532
00:44:44,509 --> 00:44:47,112
<i>Okay. Be calm. Just be...</i>

533
00:45:12,071 --> 00:45:13,971
<i>Matias, Matias, Matias,
Matias, okay.</i>

534
00:45:13,973 --> 00:45:15,674
<i>Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
no, I'm here, I'm here,</i>

535
00:45:15,676 --> 00:45:18,143
<i>- I'm here. I'm here. I'm here.
- Listen, here's the plan, okay?</i>

536
00:45:18,145 --> 00:45:20,312
<i>Nari is going to meet you down
at the police station,</i>

537
00:45:20,314 --> 00:45:22,280
<i>there's one that's half
a mile away from your place.</i>

538
00:45:22,282 --> 00:45:24,416
<i>You need to bring the laptop
with you, because every...</i>

539
00:45:24,418 --> 00:45:26,619
<i>Wait, wait, wait, wait,
where's Damon? Where's Damon?</i>

540
00:45:26,621 --> 00:45:28,221
<i>No, no, no, no, we need...
we need Damon.</i>

541
00:45:28,223 --> 00:45:30,156
<i>- Damon! Damon! We need Damon!
- What? Matias!</i>

542
00:45:30,158 --> 00:45:32,525
<i>- We need Damon right now! Damon!
- I'm sorry!</i>

543
00:45:32,527 --> 00:45:34,694
<i>- Have we called the police or what?
- No, we're not calling police.</i>

544
00:45:34,696 --> 00:45:36,362
<i>We're going to the police,
okay? Matias...</i>

545
00:45:36,364 --> 00:45:38,531
<i>We don't have a lot of time, okay?
We need to help this girl.</i>

546
00:45:38,533 --> 00:45:40,032
<i>- Matias!
- Yeah.</i>

547
00:45:40,034 --> 00:45:42,569
<i>- I know there's a lot going on, okay?
- Uh-hmm.</i>

548
00:45:42,571 --> 00:45:47,674
<i>But you need to trust us,
and you need to move fast.</i>

549
00:45:47,676 --> 00:45:50,677
<i>Get the laptop,
go down to the police station.</i>

550
00:45:50,679 --> 00:45:52,146
<i>- I will be there, okay?
- No.</i>

551
00:45:52,148 --> 00:45:54,348
<i>- I have a friend that will meet us.
- We can't.</i>

552
00:45:54,350 --> 00:45:56,250
<i>He knows how to deal
with this kind of situation!</i>

553
00:45:56,252 --> 00:45:58,452
<i>- Yes! Yes, yes, yes, you can.
- No, we can't... we can't...</i>

554
00:45:58,454 --> 00:46:01,321
<i>It's not... it's not real.</i>

555
00:46:01,323 --> 00:46:03,023
<i>What?</i>

556
00:46:03,025 --> 00:46:04,461
<i>It's, um...</i>

557
00:46:06,162 --> 00:46:07,695
<i>It's a... it's a game.</i>

558
00:46:07,697 --> 00:46:09,029
<i>I made the whole thing up.</i>

559
00:46:09,031 --> 00:46:10,200
<i>It's a game.</i>

560
00:46:12,769 --> 00:46:17,107
<i>Lexx, you were... You were totally
onto me from the beginning.</i>

561
00:46:19,443 --> 00:46:21,544
<i>Wait, I'm confused.</i>

562
00:46:21,546 --> 00:46:23,011
<i>What?</i>

563
00:46:23,013 --> 00:46:24,713
<i>Yeah, it's, um, it's a game.</i>

564
00:46:24,715 --> 00:46:27,450
<i>It's my game. It's the one
I've been working on.</i>

565
00:46:27,452 --> 00:46:29,020
<i>Damon, Damon knows.</i>

566
00:46:31,155 --> 00:46:33,456
<i>I'm sorry, I'm lost.
I what now?</i>

567
00:46:33,458 --> 00:46:36,525
<i>I told you I was... I told you
I was writing something.</i>

568
00:46:36,527 --> 00:46:39,228
<i>- Matias, I'm...
- Uh, yeah, man, you said</i>

569
00:46:39,230 --> 00:46:41,263
<i>you're writing something,
you didn't say playtesting</i>

570
00:46:41,265 --> 00:46:45,100
<i>- or implementing.
- Well, yeah, I wanted to be...</i>

571
00:46:45,102 --> 00:46:47,437
<i>I wanted to get an actual
response out of you, you know.</i>

572
00:46:47,439 --> 00:46:50,106
<i>I mean, if you... If you knew what was
coming, then it wouldn't feel real.</i>

573
00:46:50,108 --> 00:46:54,377
<i>That way I could, you know, I could
tell if it actually could work.</i>

574
00:46:54,379 --> 00:46:57,080
<i>It is game night.</i>

575
00:46:57,082 --> 00:47:00,384
<i>- Holy shit, man!
- Asshole.</i>

576
00:47:00,386 --> 00:47:03,053
<i>- Oh, my God!
- I guess that means it was pretty good, huh?</i>

577
00:47:03,055 --> 00:47:05,323
<i>Matias, this is not funny.</i>

578
00:47:05,325 --> 00:47:07,692
<i>It's... actually, it's not,
it's not supposed to be funny.</i>

579
00:47:07,694 --> 00:47:10,328
<i>- It's actually, uh, it's a horror transmedia.
- Oh, holy shit... It's an ARG.</i>

580
00:47:10,330 --> 00:47:12,798
<i>- It's an alternate reality game.
- Exactly, yeah.</i>

581
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:17,201
<i>It's a... it's a test of what you would
do if the experience actually happened.</i>

582
00:47:17,203 --> 00:47:19,136
<i>- Wow!
- Wow. That was bloody...</i>

583
00:47:19,138 --> 00:47:21,105
<i>- Wait, AJ, were you in on this?
- Hell no!</i>

584
00:47:21,107 --> 00:47:22,741
<i>I had no...
I had no idea about this.</i>

585
00:47:22,743 --> 00:47:25,410
<i>Where... dude, where'd you...
Where'd you get those videos?</i>

586
00:47:25,412 --> 00:47:28,213
<i>- That is some dark shit.
- Yeah.</i>

587
00:47:28,215 --> 00:47:31,316
<i>Yeah, I know, I know,
it's just horror films.</i>

588
00:47:31,318 --> 00:47:34,486
<i>What... hah! Okay, well,
you must have dug into some</i>

589
00:47:34,488 --> 00:47:37,490
<i>really obscure shit,
because I have seen everything</i>

590
00:47:37,492 --> 00:47:40,260
<i>and I haven't seen any
of those videos that you...</i>

591
00:47:40,262 --> 00:47:44,163
<i>What if we'd called
the police?</i>

592
00:47:44,165 --> 00:47:47,166
<i>Well, ideally you would...
you would register to play</i>

593
00:47:47,168 --> 00:47:50,270
<i>with your cell number,
so if, you know,</i>

594
00:47:50,272 --> 00:47:52,472
<i>by the time you logged in,
if you called 911,</i>

595
00:47:52,474 --> 00:47:54,542
<i>it would hack your phone
and you would get a recording</i>

596
00:47:54,544 --> 00:47:57,243
<i>like the bad guy hacked
into the phone.</i>

597
00:47:57,245 --> 00:47:58,712
<i>Wow!</i>

598
00:47:58,714 --> 00:48:01,348
<i>That, you know, it's crazy.</i>

599
00:48:01,350 --> 00:48:03,319
<i>- Phew!
- Wait, the...</i>

600
00:48:23,607 --> 00:48:27,110
<i>I went to that ASL class,</i>

601
00:48:28,512 --> 00:48:30,746
<i>or the... or the...
or the first one,</i>

602
00:48:30,748 --> 00:48:32,782
<i>the first one, at least.</i>

603
00:48:32,784 --> 00:48:34,417
<i>And then... and the guy,</i>

604
00:48:34,419 --> 00:48:36,619
<i>he was... he was...
he was teaching the class,</i>

605
00:48:36,621 --> 00:48:38,354
<i>he was talking about</i>

606
00:48:38,356 --> 00:48:42,224
<i>how hard it was
for a hearing-impaired person</i>

607
00:48:42,226 --> 00:48:44,895
<i>to have a meaningful
relationship with someone</i>

608
00:48:44,897 --> 00:48:46,562
<i>who couldn't sign.</i>

609
00:48:46,564 --> 00:48:50,166
<i>And then... and how it builds
this special bond,</i>

610
00:48:50,168 --> 00:48:53,269
<i>the ability to communicate
with someone</i>

611
00:48:53,271 --> 00:48:54,751
<i>in a... in a special way
that would...</i>

612
00:49:00,512 --> 00:49:01,647
<i>And you're right.</i>

613
00:49:06,853 --> 00:49:09,154
<i>I'm really fucking scared,
Amaya.</i>

614
00:49:10,857 --> 00:49:12,890
<i>I mean, I've never cared</i>

615
00:49:12,892 --> 00:49:15,927
<i>about anyone or anything</i>

616
00:49:15,929 --> 00:49:17,430
<i>the way I care about you.</i>

617
00:49:20,900 --> 00:49:22,634
<i>The night we met at the bar,</i>

618
00:49:22,636 --> 00:49:24,235
<i>I...</i>

619
00:49:24,237 --> 00:49:27,240
<i>the music was so loud, and...</i>

620
00:49:28,609 --> 00:49:31,712
<i>I saw you
and I remember thinking...</i>

621
00:49:32,847 --> 00:49:34,813
<i>Oh, why bother?</i>

622
00:49:34,815 --> 00:49:37,216
<i>That a beautiful person</i>

623
00:49:37,218 --> 00:49:38,784
<i>wouldn't be able
to hear you anyway,</i>

624
00:49:38,786 --> 00:49:40,388
<i>it's so loud.</i>

625
00:49:42,423 --> 00:49:45,892
<i>I didn't know you were deaf.</i>

626
00:49:45,894 --> 00:49:47,661
<i>I didn't know</i>

627
00:49:47,663 --> 00:49:50,399
<i>that all that noise
wouldn't matter.</i>

628
00:49:53,335 --> 00:49:56,903
<i>I mean,
that's what I want for us.</i>

629
00:49:56,905 --> 00:50:00,908
<i>I want nothing else to matter.</i>

630
00:50:00,910 --> 00:50:03,678
<i>I want nothing
to be in the way</i>

631
00:50:03,680 --> 00:50:05,615
<i>of how much I love you.</i>

632
00:50:15,258 --> 00:50:17,758
<i>I need you
to come here, okay?</i>

633
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:21,197
<i>I need you to get here
as fast as you can, okay?</i>

634
00:50:22,032 --> 00:50:24,601
<i>Take the subway, okay?</i>

635
00:50:37,381 --> 00:50:40,649
<i>Matias, what was
with them Roman numerals?</i>

636
00:50:40,651 --> 00:50:42,952
<i>- Like, why the Roman numerals?
- Oh, yeah.</i>

637
00:50:42,954 --> 00:50:44,554
<i>- What do you mean?
- That's weird.</i>

638
00:50:44,556 --> 00:50:46,656
<i>Well, in the game,
instead of Charon's</i>

639
00:50:46,658 --> 00:50:48,925
<i>just like being like a,
you know, Charon 4,</i>

640
00:50:48,927 --> 00:50:50,660
<i>like the number four,
it had an IV.</i>

641
00:50:50,662 --> 00:50:53,296
<i>And what about the girl
in the video,</i>

642
00:50:53,298 --> 00:50:54,831
<i>the one who was next?</i>

643
00:50:54,833 --> 00:50:55,999
<i>What about her?</i>

644
00:50:57,036 --> 00:50:58,668
<i>Where'd you get the video?</i>

645
00:50:58,670 --> 00:51:00,603
<i>Sorry, guys.
I got to take this.</i>

646
00:51:00,605 --> 00:51:02,539
<i>It's the... it's the
Puppet Masters.</i>

647
00:51:02,541 --> 00:51:05,008
<i>- No problem.
- Mute your mic, Lexx.</i>

648
00:51:05,010 --> 00:51:06,777
<i>- Yeah.
- Mama!</i>

649
00:51:07,947 --> 00:51:09,680
<i>Lexx, mute your mic!</i>

650
00:51:09,682 --> 00:51:12,050
<i>- Oh, my God.
- She does this every time.</i>

651
00:51:12,052 --> 00:51:13,650
<i>Yeah, you are louder than her.</i>

652
00:51:13,652 --> 00:51:16,487
<i>Oh, my God. Mama.</i>

653
00:51:16,489 --> 00:51:18,455
<i>I love how loud she is
on the phone to her mother.</i>

654
00:51:18,457 --> 00:51:20,759
<i>It's just like,
straight up, like, bam.</i>

655
00:51:20,761 --> 00:51:21,793
<i>I know.</i>

656
00:51:27,100 --> 00:51:29,634
<i>You guys,
we do not have to play a game.</i>

657
00:51:29,636 --> 00:51:31,603
<i>Let's just chat.
Let's just hang out,</i>

658
00:51:31,605 --> 00:51:35,074
<i>and, um, you know,
what if... you guys,</i>

659
00:51:35,076 --> 00:51:36,909
<i>maybe we should do
a guided meditation together.</i>

660
00:51:36,911 --> 00:51:38,144
<i>Um, no.</i>

661
00:51:38,146 --> 00:51:40,579
<i>I really did think
that was real for a second.</i>

662
00:51:40,581 --> 00:51:44,083
<i>I'm gonna be honest.
I was totally there.</i>

663
00:51:44,085 --> 00:51:46,786
<i>That was the most fun I've had,
in, like, two years.</i>

664
00:51:46,788 --> 00:51:49,590
<i>Ugh. Good one.</i>

665
00:52:35,072 --> 00:52:36,138
<i>Matias, Matias.</i>

666
00:52:36,140 --> 00:52:37,739
<i>I have more questions, man.</i>

667
00:52:37,741 --> 00:52:39,575
<i>Yeah, here,
I'm sorry. What's up?</i>

668
00:52:39,577 --> 00:52:42,010
<i>Is it better, like,
that we did it as a team,</i>

669
00:52:42,012 --> 00:52:44,180
<i>or as a solo experience?</i>

670
00:52:44,182 --> 00:52:45,747
<i>And also...
and like how the hell</i>

671
00:52:45,749 --> 00:52:47,482
<i>are you handling
the decision tree?</i>

672
00:52:47,484 --> 00:52:48,684
<i>Like, say, if we had decided</i>

673
00:52:48,686 --> 00:52:50,652
<i>to do something
with the bad guy's money,</i>

674
00:52:50,654 --> 00:52:52,922
<i>if we'd taken it,
then how does that ripple</i>

675
00:52:52,924 --> 00:52:55,424
<i>through the rest of the story?</i>

676
00:52:57,495 --> 00:52:58,728
<i>Hello? Matia...</i>

677
00:52:58,730 --> 00:53:01,030
<i>Oh, bloody hell,
he's away with the fairies.</i>

678
00:53:01,032 --> 00:53:02,665
<i>- Matias!
- Hold on, I'll be...</i>

679
00:53:02,667 --> 00:53:04,500
<i>I'll be right back.
I'll be right back.</i>

680
00:53:04,502 --> 00:53:06,203
<i>How long are you
gonna be gone this time?</i>

681
00:53:26,126 --> 00:53:29,027
<i>Are you there?</i>

682
00:53:29,029 --> 00:53:31,629
<i>Are you there?
Can you hear me...</i>

683
00:53:31,631 --> 00:53:32,933
<i>Hear me?</i>

684
00:53:39,106 --> 00:53:41,473
<i>Good.</i>

685
00:53:41,475 --> 00:53:43,443
<i>Then watch this.</i>

686
00:54:15,077 --> 00:54:17,144
<i>You get the computer back</i>

687
00:54:17,146 --> 00:54:19,546
<i>when I get Amaya back.</i>

688
00:54:19,548 --> 00:54:21,548
<i>You get the money back
when I see on the news</i>

689
00:54:21,550 --> 00:54:25,219
<i>that Erica Dunne is back home
safe with her parents.</i>

690
00:54:30,660 --> 00:54:32,293
<i>You stupid motherfucker.</i>

691
00:54:32,295 --> 00:54:35,063
<i>- All I want is my laptop.
- All I want is Amaya.</i>

692
00:54:35,065 --> 00:54:36,597
<i>You don't understand</i>

693
00:54:36,599 --> 00:54:37,865
<i>what you have gotten
yourself into.</i>

694
00:54:37,867 --> 00:54:40,302
<i>- You killed Kelly!
- No, I didn't.</i>

695
00:54:40,304 --> 00:54:42,804
<i>If you lay a hand
on Amaya or Erica,</i>

696
00:54:42,806 --> 00:54:44,306
<i>you'll never see
any of that money.</i>

697
00:54:44,308 --> 00:54:46,141
<i>Shut the fuck up and listen.</i>

698
00:54:46,143 --> 00:54:49,011
<i>- They do not let girls go.
- What are you talking about?</i>

699
00:54:49,013 --> 00:54:51,680
<i>The Circle,
the people I work with,</i>

700
00:54:51,682 --> 00:54:53,716
<i>all the other Charon clients,</i>

701
00:54:53,718 --> 00:54:55,751
<i>they monitor
all Bitcoin accounts.</i>

702
00:54:55,753 --> 00:54:57,753
<i>They're gonna think
I'm trying to cash out.</i>

703
00:55:03,095 --> 00:55:05,295
<i>Hello?</i>

704
00:55:05,297 --> 00:55:06,932
<i>Hello, hello!</i>

705
00:55:11,636 --> 00:55:13,269
<i>I lost your screen.
What's going on?</i>

706
00:55:13,271 --> 00:55:15,839
<i>- What's happening?
- I don't... I don't know.</i>

707
00:55:15,841 --> 00:55:19,043
<i>Oh, God, they pulled you
across the river, didn't they?</i>

708
00:55:19,045 --> 00:55:21,178
<i>Hey, you know what?
I'm just... I'm gonna close it.</i>

709
00:55:21,180 --> 00:55:22,780
<i>No!
Do not close it.</i>

710
00:55:22,782 --> 00:55:25,018
<i>They're gonna know
you're not me.</i>

711
00:55:29,122 --> 00:55:30,654
<i>Are they talking to you?</i>

712
00:55:30,656 --> 00:55:32,658
<i>What are they saying?</i>

713
00:55:34,927 --> 00:55:38,063
<i>They're saying...
they're saying recite the code.</i>

714
00:55:38,065 --> 00:55:39,331
<i>Oh, God.</i>

715
00:55:39,333 --> 00:55:41,233
<i>You just put a bullet
in our head.</i>

716
00:55:41,235 --> 00:55:43,971
<i>You stupid... Okay.</i>

717
00:55:45,639 --> 00:55:47,107
<i>Listen to me.</i>

718
00:55:48,108 --> 00:55:50,042
<i>If they find out</i>

719
00:55:50,044 --> 00:55:52,278
<i>that I lost that computer, they're
gonna kill me, they're gonna kill you,</i>

720
00:55:52,280 --> 00:55:54,746
<i>and they're gonna kill anyone
else that might have seen it.</i>

721
00:55:54,748 --> 00:55:56,282
<i>Just give me the code then.</i>

722
00:55:56,284 --> 00:55:57,383
<i>Give me the money
back first and then...</i>

723
00:55:57,385 --> 00:55:58,717
<i>No. Fuck you!</i>

724
00:55:58,719 --> 00:55:59,785
<i>I am 10 feet away from Amaya,</i>

725
00:55:59,787 --> 00:56:01,754
<i>and I will put a knife
in her throat</i>

726
00:56:01,756 --> 00:56:03,623
<i>and disappear before
she even hits the ground.</i>

727
00:56:03,625 --> 00:56:05,625
<i>I think you're a dead man
who lost $10 million.</i>

728
00:56:05,627 --> 00:56:06,726
<i>This can be so easy.</i>

729
00:56:06,728 --> 00:56:08,395
<i>I return Amaya,
you return the laptop,</i>

730
00:56:08,397 --> 00:56:10,096
<i>and it'll be like nothing
ever happened.</i>

731
00:56:10,098 --> 00:56:11,231
<i>No, you killed Kelly!</i>

732
00:56:11,233 --> 00:56:13,099
<i>No, I didn't.
I just bashed her head.</i>

733
00:56:13,101 --> 00:56:15,335
<i>She'll wake up and think
it was a robbery or something.</i>

734
00:56:15,337 --> 00:56:17,037
<i>We have no time for this.</i>

735
00:56:17,039 --> 00:56:18,238
<i>Return the money.</i>

736
00:56:18,240 --> 00:56:19,807
<i>No, no, no. No, no, no. No.</i>

737
00:56:19,809 --> 00:56:21,742
<i>When Erica Dunne is home safe,</i>

738
00:56:21,744 --> 00:56:23,310
<i>then you get the money.</i>

739
00:56:23,312 --> 00:56:25,179
<i>Okay.</i>

740
00:56:25,181 --> 00:56:27,114
<i>You better hurry up.</i>

741
00:56:27,116 --> 00:56:30,820
<i>They said this is
your last chance, Charon IV.</i>

742
00:56:32,688 --> 00:56:34,189
<i>Okay, okay.</i>

743
00:56:34,191 --> 00:56:37,292
<i>Type A-B-Y-S-S-U-S.</i>

744
00:56:37,294 --> 00:56:40,829
<i>Second word:
A-B-Y-S-S-U-M.</i>

745
00:56:40,831 --> 00:56:44,699
<i>Third word:
I-N-V-O-C-A-T.</i>

746
00:56:44,701 --> 00:56:46,034
<i>Oh, wait, they're typing
in all caps.</i>

747
00:56:46,036 --> 00:56:48,437
<i>- Should it be in all caps?
- Just fucking send it.</i>

748
00:56:48,439 --> 00:56:50,107
<i>Okay. All right.</i>

749
00:56:51,741 --> 00:56:53,675
<i>They're asking
why you drained the account.</i>

750
00:56:53,677 --> 00:56:55,947
<i>Tell them I switched
from Bitcoin to Ethereum.</i>

751
00:57:01,052 --> 00:57:02,351
<i>They're asking why.</i>

752
00:57:02,353 --> 00:57:04,120
<i>It's a better exchange rate.</i>

753
00:57:04,122 --> 00:57:05,189
<i>I got a tip.</i>

754
00:57:12,131 --> 00:57:13,698
<i>Are they buying it?</i>

755
00:57:18,337 --> 00:57:20,205
<i>Yeah, think so.</i>

756
00:57:23,775 --> 00:57:25,275
<i>We'll be there soon,
you'll get Amaya.</i>

757
00:57:25,277 --> 00:57:27,146
<i>And you'll get your laptop.</i>

758
00:57:30,383 --> 00:57:32,883
<i>If I let Erica go,</i>

759
00:57:32,885 --> 00:57:35,153
<i>they're gonna think
that she escaped and...</i>

760
00:57:35,155 --> 00:57:37,421
<i>they're gonna lose faith,
they're gonna hold me liable.</i>

761
00:57:37,423 --> 00:57:38,590
<i>Yeah, but you'll have
$10 million</i>

762
00:57:38,592 --> 00:57:42,461
<i>to help you figure out
how to disappear.</i>

763
00:57:42,463 --> 00:57:45,264
<i>If anything goes wrong
between here and there,</i>

764
00:57:45,266 --> 00:57:47,168
<i>you're both dead.</i>

765
00:57:52,506 --> 00:57:53,839
<i>He's lying to us.</i>

766
00:57:53,841 --> 00:57:56,375
<i>He's back. Matias.</i>

767
00:57:56,377 --> 00:57:59,444
<i>Yo. What?</i>

768
00:57:59,446 --> 00:58:03,949
<i>- Okay, Nari, it is just a game.
- I found her. Okay?</i>

769
00:58:03,951 --> 00:58:06,818
<i>- I found the girl, Matias, from your video.
- Found who?</i>

770
00:58:06,820 --> 00:58:08,221
<i>She's real.
Her name's Erica Dunne.</i>

771
00:58:08,223 --> 00:58:10,256
<i>She is real,
and she's really missing.</i>

772
00:58:10,258 --> 00:58:12,492
<i>No, Nari, I know, I know.
I just... That was a...</i>

773
00:58:12,494 --> 00:58:14,961
<i>Is it... Is it just
a placeholder or like...</i>

774
00:58:14,963 --> 00:58:16,863
<i>Yeah. No, it is, it is,
it's a placeholder.</i>

775
00:58:16,865 --> 00:58:18,532
<i>Dude, that's messed up, man.</i>

776
00:58:18,534 --> 00:58:21,968
<i>Where did you even
get the video?</i>

777
00:58:21,970 --> 00:58:22,735
<i>LiveLeak.</i>

778
00:58:22,737 --> 00:58:23,803
<i>Yeah, someone on the inside</i>

779
00:58:23,805 --> 00:58:25,805
<i>just must have...
must have leaked it</i>

780
00:58:25,807 --> 00:58:26,873
<i>or something. I don't know.</i>

781
00:58:26,875 --> 00:58:29,011
<i>Why would you use that video?</i>

782
00:58:31,547 --> 00:58:33,247
<i>Okay, you know what?
Send the link.</i>

783
00:58:33,249 --> 00:58:34,915
<i>Nari, that's ridiculous.</i>

784
00:58:34,917 --> 00:58:36,450
<i>What?</i>

785
00:58:36,452 --> 00:58:38,486
<i>Who's that?</i>

786
00:58:38,488 --> 00:58:41,323
<i>Is that... Is that Amaya?</i>

787
00:58:41,325 --> 00:58:43,092
<i>Turn on your video, love.</i>

788
00:58:45,529 --> 00:58:48,330
<i>- Matias?
- No, no, no. Get him off.</i>

789
00:58:48,332 --> 00:58:50,832
<i>- Matias, is that you?
- How do we get this person off?</i>

790
00:58:50,834 --> 00:58:52,554
<i>Does anyone know
how we get this person off?</i>

791
00:58:54,171 --> 00:58:56,238
<i>- Stop it.
- Wait, what's going on?</i>

792
00:58:56,240 --> 00:58:57,973
<i>Come on, Matias.</i>

793
00:58:57,975 --> 00:58:59,508
<i>Are you... you sneaky
little bastard.</i>

794
00:58:59,510 --> 00:59:01,142
<i>He's playing us.
It's still the game.</i>

795
00:59:01,144 --> 00:59:03,179
<i>No. No, guys, do... hey,
listen, do not click the link.</i>

796
00:59:03,181 --> 00:59:05,448
<i>- Is this the link?
- Do not click the link.</i>

797
00:59:05,450 --> 00:59:07,984
<i>Do you hear me?</i>

798
00:59:07,986 --> 00:59:09,552
<i>Guys,
we didn't click the link,</i>

799
00:59:09,554 --> 00:59:11,254
<i>but the video's playing anyway.</i>

800
00:59:11,256 --> 00:59:12,790
<i>Same here.</i>

801
00:59:14,158 --> 00:59:16,025
<i>- What the...
- What is it?</i>

802
00:59:16,027 --> 00:59:17,927
<i>That was senior year.
That's December.</i>

803
00:59:17,929 --> 00:59:20,297
<i>That's actually
McLeary's Pub, yeah?</i>

804
00:59:26,005 --> 00:59:28,005
<i>- This is so cool.
- What does this have</i>

805
00:59:28,007 --> 00:59:29,973
<i>- to do with the...
- I don't know.</i>

806
00:59:29,975 --> 00:59:33,310
<i>Wait, guys,
where is Lexx?</i>

807
00:59:33,312 --> 00:59:36,179
<i>She's probably still getting
a bollocking from her mom.</i>

808
00:59:36,181 --> 00:59:37,216
<i>Lexx!</i>

809
00:59:42,589 --> 00:59:44,188
<i>- What is that?
- That's Drill Bit.</i>

810
00:59:44,190 --> 00:59:46,024
<i>- That's an exploit.
- What is an exploit?</i>

811
00:59:46,026 --> 00:59:47,894
<i>It's a hacking tool.</i>

812
00:59:51,064 --> 00:59:52,130
<i>Lexx!</i>

813
00:59:52,132 --> 00:59:53,231
<i>Weird.</i>

814
00:59:53,233 --> 00:59:55,066
<i>Are you calling Lexx
right now?</i>

815
00:59:55,068 --> 00:59:56,968
<i>Yes,
I'm calling Lexx right now.</i>

816
00:59:56,970 --> 00:59:58,970
<i>Wait, wait,
I thought she was...</i>

817
01:00:02,410 --> 01:00:03,642
<i>Where is she?</i>

818
01:00:03,644 --> 01:00:05,611
<i>Okay, I am lo...</i>

819
01:00:05,613 --> 01:00:08,349
<i>Is she in on this, Matias?
What's going on?</i>

820
01:00:10,951 --> 01:00:12,351
<i>Is that the German place?</i>

821
01:00:28,136 --> 01:00:29,035
<i>No!</i>

822
01:00:29,037 --> 01:00:30,370
<i>Did she just jump?</i>

823
01:00:30,372 --> 01:00:32,408
<i>Oh, my God! Help!</i>

824
01:00:41,351 --> 01:00:43,551
<i>Matias?</i>

825
01:00:43,553 --> 01:00:45,121
<i>Was that Lexx?</i>

826
01:00:47,390 --> 01:00:49,457
<i>Jeez.</i>

827
01:00:49,459 --> 01:00:51,158
<i>Matias, please, talk to us.</i>

828
01:00:51,160 --> 01:00:54,463
<i>This is just...
This is the game.</i>

829
01:00:54,465 --> 01:00:56,264
<i>That wasn't her.</i>

830
01:01:12,249 --> 01:01:15,050
<i>Hey, hey, hey.
Hey, how close are you?</i>

831
01:01:15,052 --> 01:01:17,155
<i>How close... how close
are you to the subway?</i>

832
01:01:18,423 --> 01:01:20,289
<i>Okay, okay, can you...
Can you do me a favor?</i>

833
01:01:20,291 --> 01:01:22,158
<i>Can you... Can you stay
on the call?</i>

834
01:01:22,160 --> 01:01:24,160
<i>And just keep your...
keep your phone in your pocket,</i>

835
01:01:24,162 --> 01:01:27,165
<i>or whatever,
just stay on, okay?</i>

836
01:01:29,535 --> 01:01:31,335
<i>Just trust me, okay?</i>

837
01:01:31,337 --> 01:01:33,069
<i>And when you...
and I'll explain it to you</i>

838
01:01:33,071 --> 01:01:35,972
<i>when you... when you get here,
all right?</i>

839
01:01:35,974 --> 01:01:37,441
<i>Wait, no.
Nari, Nari, Nari, Nari,</i>

840
01:01:37,443 --> 01:01:39,243
<i>- who are you calling?
- I'm calling Lexx.</i>

841
01:01:39,245 --> 01:01:41,178
<i>Don't. Please,
do not call her right now.</i>

842
01:01:41,180 --> 01:01:43,080
<i>- Okay? Please, just trust...
- Straight to voicemail.</i>

843
01:01:43,082 --> 01:01:45,282
<i>Okay, guys. Hey, listen to me
for a second, all right?</i>

844
01:01:45,284 --> 01:01:47,117
<i>No more calls, all right?
We just... you can...</i>

845
01:01:47,119 --> 01:01:48,318
<i>you can leave your phones on,</i>

846
01:01:48,320 --> 01:01:50,154
<i>- but just don't...
- Why?</i>

847
01:01:50,156 --> 01:01:52,290
<i>There are automated calls,
it's part of the game.</i>

848
01:01:52,292 --> 01:01:54,192
<i>I just... I just wanna make sure
that they're going through.</i>

849
01:01:54,194 --> 01:01:55,727
<i>Bullshit, Matias.
Bullshit, okay?</i>

850
01:01:55,729 --> 01:01:56,928
<i>- Okay, Nari, Nari.
- I have had enough.</i>

851
01:01:56,930 --> 01:01:59,063
<i>I swear, if you don't start
talking now...</i>

852
01:01:59,065 --> 01:02:00,398
<i>Matias is playing with you.</i>

853
01:02:00,400 --> 01:02:02,367
<i>No. No, no,
I am calling the police.</i>

854
01:02:02,369 --> 01:02:04,469
<i>Nari, Nari, please.
Do not do that.</i>

855
01:02:04,471 --> 01:02:06,605
<i>- Please, hang, hang up the phone, Nari.
- No, I am not.</i>

856
01:02:06,607 --> 01:02:08,607
<i>- I am gonna call the police right now.
- Calm down, guys.</i>

857
01:02:08,609 --> 01:02:11,777
<i>Just give me one more second,
please, just one more second!</i>

858
01:02:11,779 --> 01:02:14,148
<i>Guys, it's real.
The whole thing is real.</i>

859
01:02:18,352 --> 01:02:21,120
<i>Just, just listen to me, all right?
The reason I said it was a game</i>

860
01:02:21,122 --> 01:02:23,757
<i>is because he said if anyone
knew or if anyone disconnected,</i>

861
01:02:23,759 --> 01:02:26,325
<i>- he would kill Amaya and then he'd come after all of you.
- Who?</i>

862
01:02:26,327 --> 01:02:29,128
<i>Charon! Charon, Charon IV.
The guy whose laptop I took.</i>

863
01:02:29,130 --> 01:02:31,331
<i>Okay, Matias. We get it.
I'm kind of done with this now.</i>

864
01:02:31,333 --> 01:02:33,200
<i>Just... can you shut up
and listen to me, please?</i>

865
01:02:33,202 --> 01:02:35,769
<i>Please. He can hear
and see everything, all right?</i>

866
01:02:35,771 --> 01:02:38,071
<i>I mean, he, he found
Amaya's apartment.</i>

867
01:02:38,073 --> 01:02:40,440
<i>She was the first person I called, so he
must have been able to track her somehow,</i>

868
01:02:40,442 --> 01:02:43,376
<i>- or, or, or I don't know.
- You're serious? You're being serious right now?</i>

869
01:02:43,378 --> 01:02:46,112
<i>She's on her way over here,
and he's following her.</i>

870
01:02:46,114 --> 01:02:48,048
<i>Wait. Wait, wait, wait. Wait.
So, so there is no game.</i>

871
01:02:48,050 --> 01:02:49,550
<i>This is all
actually happening?</i>

872
01:02:49,552 --> 01:02:52,119
<i>Oh, my God. He-he killed Lexx.</i>

873
01:02:52,121 --> 01:02:54,355
<i>I... No...
I-I-I don't know.</i>

874
01:02:54,357 --> 01:02:56,657
<i>But he... he pushed her.
He-he-he bloody killed Lexx.</i>

875
01:02:56,659 --> 01:02:59,126
<i>If he was with Amaya, then how
could he have done that to Lexx?</i>

876
01:02:59,128 --> 01:03:01,262
<i>That's exactly the thing.
It wasn't him.</i>

877
01:03:01,264 --> 01:03:03,130
<i>- It must have been one of the others.
- The other what?</i>

878
01:03:03,132 --> 01:03:05,066
<i>The other... the Charons.
The ones who buy the videos,</i>

879
01:03:05,068 --> 01:03:07,236
<i>the ones who pick the girls.
They must have figured out</i>

880
01:03:07,238 --> 01:03:08,770
<i>- that the laptop got stolen.
- Oh, my God.</i>

881
01:03:08,772 --> 01:03:11,240
<i>Guys, they're not just gonna
let that evidence float around.</i>

882
01:03:11,242 --> 01:03:13,108
<i>So, all those videos,
they're all...</i>

883
01:03:13,110 --> 01:03:14,811
<i>This is damage control.
They're doing a clean-up.</i>

884
01:03:14,813 --> 01:03:17,079
<i>If they found Lexx, can they
find the rest of us, too?</i>

885
01:03:17,081 --> 01:03:19,248
<i>I am ghosted online.
They can't find me.</i>

886
01:03:19,250 --> 01:03:21,851
<i>Okay. He's right, he's right.
You need to get to AJ's house.</i>

887
01:03:21,853 --> 01:03:25,421
<i>No, wait. Do not... No!
If these guys are that good...</i>

888
01:03:25,423 --> 01:03:28,491
<i>they can track cell phones, they can track
cars. Do not lead them to my place.</i>

889
01:03:28,493 --> 01:03:31,828
<i>Just listen to me, guys. You have to stay
online and act like nothing is wrong.</i>

890
01:03:31,830 --> 01:03:34,564
<i>What we can't do is sit around, wait
till someone shows up at our door.</i>

891
01:03:34,566 --> 01:03:37,133
<i>Wait. Wait, wait.</i>

892
01:03:37,135 --> 01:03:38,836
<i>How do we know
he's not listening now?</i>

893
01:03:38,838 --> 01:03:40,771
<i>Because of Facebook chat.
The green light,</i>

894
01:03:40,773 --> 01:03:42,373
<i>it goes off
when she loses connection.</i>

895
01:03:42,375 --> 01:03:44,275
<i>That's why I told her
to take the subway.</i>

896
01:03:44,277 --> 01:03:46,477
<i>So when she'd lose connection
and went underground,</i>

897
01:03:46,479 --> 01:03:48,479
<i>then I could tell you guys what
was fucking happening, all right?</i>

898
01:03:48,481 --> 01:03:52,316
<i>Look, there's no service in the station,
but there's Wi-Fi in the subway cars.</i>

899
01:03:52,318 --> 01:03:54,318
<i>So, as soon as she gets
on that train,</i>

900
01:03:54,320 --> 01:03:56,220
<i>she's gonna have Wi-Fi again,
and so will he.</i>

901
01:03:56,222 --> 01:03:58,557
<i>All right? Let's just...
Can we just... can we just...</i>

902
01:03:58,559 --> 01:04:00,859
<i>Can we just play a game in the meantime,
act like nothing is happening?</i>

903
01:04:00,861 --> 01:04:03,762
<i>- I'll give him the laptop when he gets here.
- Wait. If he's watching,</i>

904
01:04:03,764 --> 01:04:06,131
<i>if he saw what happened to
Lexx, then doesn't he know?</i>

905
01:04:06,133 --> 01:04:07,933
<i>I don't... I don't know.
He hasn't said anything yet.</i>

906
01:04:07,935 --> 01:04:10,769
<i>So, uh, so it might have happened
when he didn't have connection or...</i>

907
01:04:13,841 --> 01:04:16,341
<i>Yo, AJ. AJ, AJ, dude,
get the hell out of there.</i>

908
01:04:16,343 --> 01:04:18,844
<i>- Get out. Get out of there.
- AJ, get out of there now.</i>

909
01:04:18,846 --> 01:04:20,913
<i>- AJ... AJ, get out!
- AJ, get out.</i>

910
01:04:20,915 --> 01:04:25,451
<i>Jesus Christ, Mom,
what are you...</i>

911
01:04:25,453 --> 01:04:27,653
<i>God.</i>

912
01:04:27,655 --> 01:04:29,890
<i>All right, all right, um,
all right, listen.</i>

913
01:04:29,892 --> 01:04:32,358
<i>I transferred all of the money, all of
the money into my account, all right?</i>

914
01:04:32,360 --> 01:04:34,360
<i>- Just temporarily.
- Why didn't you tell us?</i>

915
01:04:34,362 --> 01:04:35,929
<i>Why, why didn't you try
and warn us?</i>

916
01:04:35,931 --> 01:04:37,764
<i>How could I have
warned you, Damon?</i>

917
01:04:37,766 --> 01:04:40,199
<i>If I did, Amaya would be...</i>

918
01:04:40,201 --> 01:04:42,235
<i>And I just did it
as insurance, all right?</i>

919
01:04:42,237 --> 01:04:43,770
<i>What, what about the laptop?
Isn't that enough insurance?</i>

920
01:04:43,772 --> 01:04:45,539
<i>He's, he's not gonna hurt
Amaya when you got...</i>

921
01:04:45,541 --> 01:04:47,874
<i>- Not just Amaya.
- You've got all his evidence!</i>

922
01:04:47,876 --> 01:04:49,610
<i>Erica Dunne.</i>

923
01:04:49,612 --> 01:04:51,378
<i>I told him he would get
the money back</i>

924
01:04:51,380 --> 01:04:53,549
<i>once I knew
that she was free too.</i>

925
01:04:54,684 --> 01:04:55,685
<i>Oh.</i>

926
01:04:57,721 --> 01:05:00,521
<i>Matty, you are so dead.</i>

927
01:05:00,523 --> 01:05:02,924
<i>What the hell else
was I supposed to do?</i>

928
01:05:02,926 --> 01:05:04,726
<i>You saw what he does
to those people.</i>

929
01:05:04,728 --> 01:05:06,394
<i>What'd you think was gonna
happen? You think he was just</i>

930
01:05:06,396 --> 01:05:09,366
<i>gonna take the laptop
and walk away?</i>

931
01:05:11,401 --> 01:05:14,335
<i>I know what
I'm asking you to do is...</i>

932
01:05:14,337 --> 01:05:16,204
<i>Amaya's gonna be here
in five minutes,</i>

933
01:05:16,206 --> 01:05:18,974
<i>and I can't promise you that
in those five minutes</i>

934
01:05:18,976 --> 01:05:21,410
<i>that no one else is gonna
show up at your door,</i>

935
01:05:21,412 --> 01:05:23,579
<i>but...</i>

936
01:05:23,581 --> 01:05:26,415
<i>Guys, if we don't do this,
Amaya's...</i>

937
01:05:26,417 --> 01:05:28,552
<i>Please.</i>

938
01:05:42,801 --> 01:05:43,833
<i>Okay.</i>

939
01:05:43,835 --> 01:05:46,371
<i>So, uh, who wants to go first?</i>

940
01:05:53,513 --> 01:05:54,580
<i>I'll go.</i>

941
01:05:57,016 --> 01:05:59,452
<i>Yeah, well, that one sucks.</i>

942
01:06:04,724 --> 01:06:07,625
<i>Um, my gym teacher got fired</i>

943
01:06:07,627 --> 01:06:08,827
<i>for adding blank</i>

944
01:06:08,829 --> 01:06:11,632
<i>to the obstacle course.</i>

945
01:06:20,808 --> 01:06:22,609
<i>Too much cocaine.</i>

946
01:06:23,845 --> 01:06:25,712
<i>Velcro.</i>

947
01:06:25,714 --> 01:06:28,750
<i>Uh, depression.</i>

948
01:06:31,285 --> 01:06:32,585
<i>I like Velcro.</i>

949
01:06:36,024 --> 01:06:38,526
<i>Thought depression
was pretty good.</i>

950
01:06:39,928 --> 01:06:41,694
<i>All right, I'll go.</i>

951
01:06:41,696 --> 01:06:43,764
<i>Uh, or do you wanna go, Damon?</i>

952
01:06:43,766 --> 01:06:47,500
<i>- Yeah. Yeah, all right.
- Yeah? Um, all right.</i>

953
01:06:47,502 --> 01:06:50,637
<i>Um, uh, in his new action,</i>

954
01:06:50,639 --> 01:06:53,674
<i>in his new action comedy,
Jackie Chan must fend off</i>

955
01:06:53,676 --> 01:06:55,642
<i>- ninjas while also...
- Hey, uh, Nari.</i>

956
01:06:55,644 --> 01:06:58,512
<i>Uh, Nari, we're, we're,
we're trying to play.</i>

957
01:06:58,514 --> 01:07:00,647
<i>- Uh, uh...
- Sorry.</i>

958
01:07:00,649 --> 01:07:01,950
<i>A horse with no legs.</i>

959
01:07:01,952 --> 01:07:04,686
<i>- What, uh, what is...
- Right?</i>

960
01:07:04,688 --> 01:07:07,591
<i>Uh, go around...
going around punching people.</i>

961
01:07:08,692 --> 01:07:09,991
<i>- Yeah.
- Yeah.</i>

962
01:07:09,993 --> 01:07:11,059
<i>That's... you would pick that.</i>

963
01:07:11,061 --> 01:07:12,894
<i>That's pretty good try.</i>

964
01:07:12,896 --> 01:07:14,662
<i>Yeah.</i>

965
01:07:14,664 --> 01:07:16,397
<i>Matias, give me access
to the laptop.</i>

966
01:07:16,399 --> 01:07:17,866
<i>System Preferences,
Users and Groups,</i>

967
01:07:17,868 --> 01:07:21,603
<i>Add User, make sure you give me
administrative access.</i>

968
01:07:21,605 --> 01:07:23,638
<i>Wait, I'm just...
What are you gonna be doing?</i>

969
01:07:23,640 --> 01:07:25,406
<i>I am gonna back-up
all the videos</i>

970
01:07:25,408 --> 01:07:26,742
<i>and I'm gonna go
through location services,</i>

971
01:07:26,744 --> 01:07:28,778
<i>in case we can find out
where the laptop's been,</i>

972
01:07:28,780 --> 01:07:30,980
<i>then maybe we can find
the missing girl.</i>

973
01:07:30,982 --> 01:07:32,448
<i>Wait, what do you mean?</i>

974
01:07:32,450 --> 01:07:33,682
<i>Are we...
don't worry, okay?</i>

975
01:07:33,684 --> 01:07:35,351
<i>What are you... what... no.</i>

976
01:07:35,353 --> 01:07:36,418
<i>You guys, my friend
on the force,</i>

977
01:07:36,420 --> 01:07:37,620
<i>he's coming over here, so...</i>

978
01:07:37,622 --> 01:07:38,687
<i>Um...</i>

979
01:07:38,689 --> 01:07:40,924
<i>Okay.</i>

980
01:07:40,926 --> 01:07:42,159
<i>Um, blank.</i>

981
01:07:42,161 --> 01:07:45,495
<i>Awesome in theory,
kind of a mess in practice.</i>

982
01:07:45,497 --> 01:07:49,633
<i>Um, uh, the swim team,</i>

983
01:07:49,635 --> 01:07:50,702
<i>all at once.</i>

984
01:07:53,505 --> 01:07:54,971
<i>Okay, he's gone.
AJ, AJ, AJ,</i>

985
01:07:54,973 --> 01:07:56,640
<i>as soon as Amaya
gets to my place,</i>

986
01:07:56,642 --> 01:07:58,109
<i>you disconnect,
and you and your mom</i>

987
01:07:58,111 --> 01:07:59,309
<i>get the hell out of your house.
All right?</i>

988
01:07:59,311 --> 01:08:01,511
<i>You're the only one
who might not be safe.</i>

989
01:08:01,513 --> 01:08:03,513
<i>Uh, Damon's in London,
they can't get to him.</i>

990
01:08:03,515 --> 01:08:05,082
<i>And Nari's got a friend
on the force,</i>

991
01:08:05,084 --> 01:08:06,751
<i>so, so the cops
are already on their way.</i>

992
01:08:06,753 --> 01:08:07,819
<i>Okay, listen,</i>

993
01:08:07,821 --> 01:08:09,787
<i>you guys cannot stay there.</i>

994
01:08:09,789 --> 01:08:10,955
<i>No, no, no.
We're not going to.</i>

995
01:08:10,957 --> 01:08:12,358
<i>Wait, wait, wait, uh...</i>

996
01:08:15,829 --> 01:08:17,463
<i>Um...</i>

997
01:08:25,873 --> 01:08:28,740
<i>Hey, um, Amaya's...
Amaya's gonna be late.</i>

998
01:08:28,742 --> 01:08:30,843
<i>She says there's something
wrong with the subway.</i>

999
01:08:30,845 --> 01:08:32,511
<i>Do you, uh... do you guys...</i>

1000
01:08:32,513 --> 01:08:34,780
<i>Can you guys play
a little bit longer?</i>

1001
01:08:34,782 --> 01:08:37,549
<i>- Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- I, um, totally.</i>

1002
01:08:37,551 --> 01:08:39,686
<i>- Okay.
- Hey, uh, Serena?</i>

1003
01:08:39,688 --> 01:08:41,087
<i>Serena, Nari.</i>

1004
01:08:41,089 --> 01:08:43,623
<i>- Serena?
- Guys.</i>

1005
01:08:43,625 --> 01:08:44,659
<i>Hello?</i>

1006
01:08:46,628 --> 01:08:50,697
<i>Uh, sorry, guys. Um, Nari's
skipping this round.</i>

1007
01:08:50,699 --> 01:08:55,169
<i>Uh... Matias,
can we play something else?</i>

1008
01:08:55,171 --> 01:08:56,770
<i>I'm getting, getting sick
of this game.</i>

1009
01:08:56,772 --> 01:08:58,706
<i>- How much longer?
- How much longer for...</i>

1010
01:08:58,708 --> 01:09:00,207
<i>Where did the subway
break down?</i>

1011
01:09:00,209 --> 01:09:03,077
<i>Let me... let me just...
let me ask.</i>

1012
01:09:08,784 --> 01:09:11,752
<i>Uh, it's, uh,
Western Boulevard.</i>

1013
01:09:11,754 --> 01:09:13,154
<i>Western Boulevard.</i>

1014
01:09:13,156 --> 01:09:15,790
<i>Not far. Uh...</i>

1015
01:09:15,792 --> 01:09:17,826
<i>What's going on
with Nari?</i>

1016
01:09:17,828 --> 01:09:19,460
<i>Bathroom.
She's not feeling well.</i>

1017
01:09:19,462 --> 01:09:20,831
<i>Might be a while.</i>

1018
01:09:32,743 --> 01:09:35,211
<i>Oh, you know what, fuck around
all you want, asshole!</i>

1019
01:09:35,213 --> 01:09:37,545
<i>- AJ! Dude!
- I got this shit all tied up!</i>

1020
01:09:37,547 --> 01:09:39,815
<i>- Do your worst!
- It's gone, it's gone, AJ.</i>

1021
01:09:40,818 --> 01:09:42,885
<i>I am so sick and tired</i>

1022
01:09:42,887 --> 01:09:46,022
<i>of all you sheeple not being
sick and tired enough</i>

1023
01:09:46,024 --> 01:09:47,823
<i>to get off your...</i>

1024
01:09:50,229 --> 01:09:52,229
<i>...sick and tired...</i>

1025
01:09:52,231 --> 01:09:54,698
<i>sick and tired...
sick and tired...</i>

<i>That's the way
to avoid data corruption</i>

1027
01:09:57,069 --> 01:10:00,170
<i>when using parallel SSD.</i>

1028
01:10:00,172 --> 01:10:02,706
<i>...a corruption...
corruption.</i>

1029
01:10:02,708 --> 01:10:04,975
<i>The protest going on at the,
uh, Great American Mall</i>

1030
01:10:04,977 --> 01:10:07,611
<i>in downtown for Flint,
Michigan, for that dirty water.</i>

1031
01:10:07,613 --> 01:10:08,980
<i>That went on,
so, I'm gonna pack up</i>

1032
01:10:08,982 --> 01:10:11,215
<i>all my stuff,
go downtown to the mall,</i>

1033
01:10:11,217 --> 01:10:12,951
<i>and have some fun.</i>

1034
01:10:12,953 --> 01:10:15,286
<i>Go downtown to the mall

1042
01:10:38,913 --> 01:10:40,679
<i>Sir,
is this a real emergency?</i>

1043
01:10:40,681 --> 01:10:41,680
<i>I'm gonna pack up all my...</i>

1044

<i>Sir, can you
tell me your name?</i>

1047
01:10:47,122 --> 01:10:49,557
<i>Jeffcock is a family name.</i>

1048
01:10:52,227 --> 01:10:53,662
<i>Wait...</i>

1049
01:10:54,830 --> 01:10:57,330
<i>They made that call
two minutes ago.</i>

1050
01:10:57,332 --> 01:10:59,266
<i>AJ, you need to get out of...</i>

1051
01:10:59,268 --> 01:11:00,967
<i>Police!
We have a search warrant!</i>

1052
01:11:00,969 --> 01:11:02,702
<i>No, I...</i>

1053
01:11:02,704 --> 01:11:04,804
<i>AJ, just get on the ground
right now, all right?</i>

1054
01:11:04,806 --> 01:11:06,841
<i>AJ, get on the...
get on the damn ground!</i>

1055
01:11:06,843 --> 01:11:08,843
<i>- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Get on the ground!</i>

1056
01:11:08,845 --> 01:11:10,945
<i>- Get on the ground now!
- What's going on?</i>

1057
01:11:10,947 --> 01:11:12,913
<i>- Where is your son?
- The basement.</i>

1058
01:11:12,915 --> 01:11:14,782
<i>Wait, wait, wait. What's this
on the screen right here?</i>

1059
01:11:14,784 --> 01:11:16,784
<i>- What's on the screen?
- It's AJ's desktop.</i>

1060
01:11:16,786 --> 01:11:19,687
<i>- What is...
- They're into his computer.</i>

1061
01:11:19,689 --> 01:11:21,856
<i>They're uploading something.</i>

1062
01:11:21,858 --> 01:11:24,692
<i>- Police, open the door!
- I can't. I'm on the ground.</i>

1063
01:11:24,694 --> 01:11:26,795
<i>Open the door
or we'll break it down.</i>

1064
01:11:26,797 --> 01:11:29,197
<i>Okay. Okay, I'm coming,
I'm coming, I'm coming.</i>

1065
01:11:29,199 --> 01:11:31,133
<i>- Stay down.
- Oh, my God!</i>

1066
01:11:31,135 --> 01:11:32,200
<i>Open the door!</i>

1067
01:11:32,202 --> 01:11:33,368
<i>I'm coming! I'm coming!</i>

1068
01:11:33,370 --> 01:11:34,836
<i>- No! AJ!
- No! No! No!</i>

1069
01:11:34,838 --> 01:11:36,238
<i>- AJ! No!
- Stay on the ground.</i>

1070
01:11:36,240 --> 01:11:38,341
<i>- No. AJ!
- Don't! AJ!</i>

1071
01:11:38,343 --> 01:11:40,376

- No!</i>

1072
01:11:40,378 --> 01:11:43,146
<i>AJ! No! AJ!</i>

1073
01:11:43,148 --> 01:11:45,982
<i>No! No! No!</i>

1074
01:11:45,984 --> 01:11:47,050
<i>Gun, gun!</i>

1075
01:11:51,289 --> 01:11:53,124
<i>Oh, my...</i>

1076
01:11:59,030 --> 01:12:00,364
<i>Suspect down.</i>

1077
01:12:12,278 --> 01:12:14,013
<i>Oh, AJ.</i>

1078
01:12:17,650 --> 01:12:19,850
<i>No.</i>

1079
01:12:19,852 --> 01:12:20,954
<i>Fuck.</i>

1080
01:12:23,123 --> 01:12:24,991
<i>Matias, Damon...</i>

1081
01:12:30,664 --> 01:12:31,896
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

1082
01:12:31,898 --> 01:12:33,731
<i>Oh.</i>

1083
01:12:33,733 --> 01:12:35,133
<i>He's gonna kill Amaya</i>

1084
01:12:35,135 --> 01:12:36,901
<i>as soon as that train
reaches the station.</i>

1085
01:12:36,903 --> 01:12:38,770
<i>No, Nari is on her way there
right now.</i>

1086
01:12:38,772 --> 01:12:40,306
<i>- What?
- Yeah, she's gonna try</i>

1087
01:12:40,308 --> 01:12:41,874
<i>and get there before
they can get to her.</i>

1088
01:12:41,876 --> 01:12:43,342
<i>I can...
I can get there faster.</i>

1089
01:12:43,344 --> 01:12:44,745
<i>I'm gonna go now.</i>

1090
01:12:48,082 --> 01:12:49,782
<i>What...</i>

1091
01:12:49,784 --> 01:12:51,085
<i>what's going on?</i>

1092
01:13:12,074 --> 01:13:14,710
<i>Bye, love you.</i>

1093
01:13:15,711 --> 01:13:17,711
<i>So, here's the only thing.</i>

1094
01:13:17,713 --> 01:13:19,080
<i>We were gonna tell them
tonight,</i>

1095
01:13:19,082 --> 01:13:20,248
<i>and over Skype.</i>

1096
01:13:20,250 --> 01:13:21,782
<i>Do you wanna...</i>

1097
01:13:21,784 --> 01:13:23,151
<i>Do you wanna not
tell them tonight or,</i>

1098
01:13:23,153 --> 01:13:25,419
<i>- or what...
- No, it's perfect,</i>

1099
01:13:25,421 --> 01:13:26,488
<i>because this way,</i>

1100
01:13:26,490 --> 01:13:29,759
<i>Damon gets to be there
for the news.</i>

1101
01:13:30,927 --> 01:13:32,860
<i>AJ will be fine.
He's a big boy.</i>

1102
01:13:32,862 --> 01:13:34,463
<i>- Uh-hmm.
- He's a big boy.</i>

1103
01:13:34,465 --> 01:13:36,498
<i>Big boy that'll
probably show up a lot</i>

1104
01:13:36,500 --> 01:13:38,133
<i>in symbolic protests.</i>

1105
01:13:38,135 --> 01:13:40,235
<i>That's probably true.</i>

1106
01:13:40,237 --> 01:13:41,770
<i>On a white horse.</i>

1107
01:13:41,772 --> 01:13:44,072
<i>- Like, he would love that.
- Yeah.</i>

1108
01:13:44,074 --> 01:13:45,340
<i>Or with a boom-box.</i>

1109
01:13:45,342 --> 01:13:49,111
<i>Just John Cusack style.</i>

1110
01:13:49,113 --> 01:13:50,979
<i>And then we can put him
at your parents' table.</i>

1111
01:13:50,981 --> 01:13:54,152
<i>That'll be all the energy
we all need.</i>

1112
01:13:57,822 --> 01:13:59,958
<i>They're not coming, so....</i>

1113
01:14:04,763 --> 01:14:07,063
<i>You think they would magically
change their minds</i>

1114
01:14:07,065 --> 01:14:09,233
<i>and become modern?</i>

1115
01:14:09,235 --> 01:14:12,837
<i>I mean, I'm just...
their only daughter, so...</i>

1116
01:14:13,539 --> 01:14:15,005
<i>My mom.</i>

1117
01:14:15,007 --> 01:14:16,540
<i>No, your mom's gonna be okay.</i>

1118
01:14:16,542 --> 01:14:19,310
<i>- No. Nari.
- She's... No, she has to be.</i>

1119
01:14:21,214 --> 01:14:23,849
<i>She's never gonna leave
that hospital.</i>

1120
01:14:26,085 --> 01:14:27,385
<i>Well, then, then,</i>

1121
01:14:27,387 --> 01:14:30,121
<i>let's, let's get married
tonight in her room,</i>

1122
01:14:30,123 --> 01:14:32,991
<i>and, and we can bring
the paperwork and...</i>

1123
01:14:32,993 --> 01:14:33,757
<i>In the ICU?</i>

1124
01:14:33,759 --> 01:14:35,227
<i>And she'll be our witness.</i>

1125
01:14:35,229 --> 01:14:36,263
<i>Yes, yes.</i>

1126
01:14:38,465 --> 01:14:40,734
<i>I love that idea.</i>

1127
01:14:42,369 --> 01:14:44,004
<i>But it's not the point.</i>

1128
01:14:45,473 --> 01:14:47,975
<i>I don't want you
to have to choose</i>

1129
01:14:49,377 --> 01:14:51,010
<i>between me and them.</i>

1130
01:14:51,012 --> 01:14:53,279
<i>That's...</i>

1131
01:14:53,281 --> 01:14:54,882
<i>It's not fair.</i>

1132
01:15:00,021 --> 01:15:02,888
<i>I don't want you
to have to choose.</i>

1133
01:15:02,890 --> 01:15:05,226
<i>I don't want you
to have to choose.</i>

1134
01:15:10,466 --> 01:15:13,302
<i>Wait, it's... That's Nari.</i>

1135
01:15:24,581 --> 01:15:27,881
<i>Wait.
Who, who, who is that?</i>

1136
01:15:27,883 --> 01:15:29,319
<i>That's my mom.</i>

1137
01:15:36,426 --> 01:15:38,092
<i>Oh, God!</i>

1138
01:15:43,867 --> 01:15:46,000
<i>No, no, no! No, no!</i>

1139
01:15:46,002 --> 01:15:47,202
<i>I will do anything.</i>

1140
01:15:47,204 --> 01:15:48,404
<i>Stop this right now!</i>

1141
01:15:48,406 --> 01:15:49,806
<i>I will do any...</i>

1142
01:15:52,610 --> 01:15:53,942
<i>Please!</i>

1143
01:15:53,944 --> 01:15:56,078
<i>Please, don't do this.</i>

1144
01:15:56,080 --> 01:15:58,213
<i>You can have me.
I don't care,</i>

1145
01:15:58,215 --> 01:16:00,215
<i>just, please, stop!</i>

1146
01:16:00,217 --> 01:16:01,518
<i>Please, please,</i>

1147
01:16:01,520 --> 01:16:04,354

<i>No!</i>

1165
01:16:59,314 --> 01:17:01,481
<i>Oh, God!</i>

<i>Serena, Serena,
get out of there right now!</i>

1174
01:17:26,308 --> 01:17:27,742
<i>Serena,

1175
01:17:27,744 --> 01:17:29,343

<i>Listen to me.</i>

1178
01:17:53,970 --> 01:17:55,638
<i>I want you to listen to me,</i>

1179
01:17:55,640 --> 01:17:58,041
<i>whoever I'm talking
to right now.</i>

1180
01:17:58,743 --> 01:18:00,576
<i>Amaya, my...</i>

1181
01:18:00,578 --> 01:18:03,179
<i>She has nothing to do
with any of this, okay?</i>

1182
01:18:03,181 --> 01:18:04,647
<i>She hasn't even...
she doesn't even know</i>

1183
01:18:04,649 --> 01:18:06,650
<i>I found the laptop,
all right?</i>

1184
01:18:06,652 --> 01:18:08,451
<i>The guy who lost it...
the guy who lost it,</i>

1185
01:18:08,453 --> 01:18:10,487
<i>he's, he's on the subway train
with her.</i>

1186
01:18:10,489 --> 01:18:11,621
<i>He's wearing a gray hoodie,</i>

1187
01:18:11,623 --> 01:18:13,189
<i>this is all his fault, okay?</i>

1188
01:18:13,191 --> 01:18:16,161
<i>She has nothing,
nothing to do with it!</i>

1189
01:18:17,496 --> 01:18:19,596
<i>Please!</i>

1190
01:18:19,598 --> 01:18:21,531
<i>I'll delete everything, okay?</i>

1191
01:18:21,533 --> 01:18:24,067
<i>You'll have nothing
to trace back to me, I swear.</i>

1192
01:18:24,069 --> 01:18:27,072
<i>If, if you kill him...</i>

1193
01:18:28,207 --> 01:18:29,640
<i>I don't care what you do to me,</i>

1194
01:18:29,642 --> 01:18:31,208
<i>I don't care what you do to me,</i>

1195
01:18:31,210 --> 01:18:34,481
<i>but just please leave Amaya
out of this!</i>

1196
01:19:17,626 --> 01:19:19,327
<i>No, no, no,
no, no, no.</i>

1197
01:19:20,796 --> 01:19:22,696
<i>Baby...</i>

1198
01:19:22,698 --> 01:19:24,132
<i>okay?</i>

1199
01:19:33,175 --> 01:19:35,509
<i>What?
Slow, slow, slow, slow.</i>

1200
01:19:35,511 --> 01:19:36,512
<i>Slow.</i>

1201
01:19:44,220 --> 01:19:45,254
<i>Um...</i>

1202
01:19:55,832 --> 01:19:57,499
<i>Go, go.</i>

1203
01:19:57,501 --> 01:20:00,235
<i>Go, go.</i>

1204
01:20:00,237 --> 01:20:02,470
<i>All right, uh,
you're going to get her, man?</i>

1205
01:20:02,472 --> 01:20:03,839
<i>Yeah, I am.</i>

1206
01:20:03,841 --> 01:20:05,908
<i>All right, just make sure
you leave the computer open</i>

1207
01:20:05,910 --> 01:20:07,443
<i>because I got to keep
downloading the video files.</i>

1208
01:20:07,445 --> 01:20:09,879
<i>- Uh, okay.
- Now, Matias, just be careful,</i>

1209
01:20:09,881 --> 01:20:12,417
<i>- yeah?
- Yeah.</i>

1210
01:20:30,703 --> 01:20:32,571
<i>You're there, aren't you?</i>

1211
01:20:39,445 --> 01:20:41,514
<i>Guess what?
I have been recording.</i>

1212
01:20:42,649 --> 01:20:44,283
<i>I've got the whole thing.</i>

1213
01:20:45,719 --> 01:20:48,453
<i>You should have dealt
with Matias.</i>

1214
01:20:48,455 --> 01:20:50,455
<i>He was gonna give
the computer back.</i>

1215
01:20:50,457 --> 01:20:53,458
<i>He was gonna give it back
and forget the whole thing,</i>

1216
01:20:53,460 --> 01:20:55,595
<i>but that is not
what I'm gonna do.</i>

1217
01:20:59,734 --> 01:21:00,933
<i>You see this?</i>

1218
01:21:00,935 --> 01:21:02,668
<i>Do you know what this is?</i>

1219
01:21:02,670 --> 01:21:03,836
<i>This is coordinates.</i>

1220
01:21:03,838 --> 01:21:05,904
<i>This is everywhere
that computer has been.</i>

1221
01:21:05,906 --> 01:21:07,840
<i>This is going to lead them
to Erica Dunne,</i>

1222
01:21:07,842 --> 01:21:09,675
<i>and every single girl you took.</i>

1223
01:21:09,677 --> 01:21:11,178
<i>You are finished!</i>

1224
01:21:45,715 --> 01:21:47,350
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

1225
01:22:01,932 --> 01:22:03,665
<i>- Damon, Damon, what's up?
- Matias,</i>

1226
01:22:03,667 --> 01:22:05,734
<i>Matias, he didn't lose
the laptop.</i>

1227
01:22:05,736 --> 01:22:07,636
<i>Charon IV, he left it
there deliberately.</i>

1228
01:22:07,638 --> 01:22:10,006
<i>He wanted it to be found.
They all wanted it to be found.</i>

1229
01:22:10,008 --> 01:22:12,775
<i>See, it was a lure.
They were phishing.</i>

1230
01:22:12,777 --> 01:22:15,343
<i>Uh, from the moment you entered
your Wi-Fi password,</i>

1231
01:22:15,345 --> 01:22:17,480
<i>they were in, they've had
control this whole time.</i>

1232
01:22:17,482 --> 01:22:19,582
<i>Damon, I'm sorry,
but what are you...</i>

1233
01:22:19,584 --> 01:22:20,983
<i>It was a lie.</i>

1234
01:22:20,985 --> 01:22:22,687
<i>They're setting us up.</i>

1235
01:22:24,522 --> 01:22:26,289
<i>We did everything
they wanted us to do.</i>

1236
01:22:26,291 --> 01:22:28,560
<i>We moved the money.
We copied the videos.</i>

1237
01:22:30,595 --> 01:22:33,630
<i>They're gonna make it look like
it was us the whole time.</i>

1238
01:22:33,632 --> 01:22:34,832
<i>What? I... I'm sorry,</i>

1239
01:22:34,834 --> 01:22:36,633
<i>but how did you... hello?</i>

1240
01:22:36,635 --> 01:22:38,635
<i>Hello, hello?</i>

1241
01:22:38,637 --> 01:22:40,604
<i>Okay, I'll be right there.
I'm almost there.</i>

1242
01:22:40,606 --> 01:22:42,541
<i>I'm a second away.
I'm a second away.</i>

1243
01:22:44,077 --> 01:22:45,778
<i>Inside, where?
Inside where?</i>

1244
01:22:48,547 --> 01:22:50,347
<i>What building?
Amaya, what building?</i>

1245
01:22:50,349 --> 01:22:51,415
<i>What building are you in?</i>

1246
01:22:51,417 --> 01:22:52,717
<i>I told you to go to the park,</i>

1247
01:22:52,719 --> 01:22:54,788
<i>where we had
our first kiss, Amaya.</i>

1248
01:22:59,693 --> 01:23:01,693
<i>What pin... what pin
are you taking you about?</i>

1249
01:23:01,695 --> 01:23:03,797
<i>Amaya, I didn't...
I didn't send you anything.</i>

1250
01:23:28,857 --> 01:23:29,923
<i>No, no, no, no!</i>

1251
01:23:29,925 --> 01:23:31,625
<i>Amaya, Amaya, no!</i>

1252
01:23:31,627 --> 01:23:34,394
<i>Listen, listen.
Amaya, that's not me.</i>

1253
01:23:34,396 --> 01:23:37,097
<i>No, Amaya, that's not me!</i>

1254
01:23:37,099 --> 01:23:38,865
<i>Don't, don't, don't, don't.</i>

1255
01:23:38,867 --> 01:23:40,067
<i>Don't listen to any of it.</i>

1256
01:23:40,069 --> 01:23:41,835
<i>Amaya, please.</i>

1257
01:23:41,837 --> 01:23:42,838
<i>Amaya!</i>

1258
01:23:44,941 --> 01:23:46,073

<i>Hello!</i>

1262
01:25:59,149 --> 01:26:00,682
<i>Why?</i>

It is game night.</i>
