[male reporter] Government s ources tell us
the world's energy resources

00:00:07,257 --> 00:00:10,301
will be fully exhausted
within five years.

[male official] Space Station was
completed today...

00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:25,025
designed for a risky experimental mission.

00:00:27,527 --> 00:00:28,838
[male reporter] Onboard the orbiting lab,

9
00:00:28,862 --> 00:00:30,822
is the Shepard Particle Accelerator.

10
00:00:31,072 --> 00:00:33,158
If astronauts can get
the Shepard working,

11
00:00:33,324 --> 00:00:34,784
it would produce free energy,

12
00:00:34,868 --> 00:00:36,786
solving the earth's energy crisis forever.

13
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:38,997

announce

new energy rationing provisions...

16
00:00:47,797 --> 00:00:50,317
[female reporter 2]...the dissolution of
these international alliances...

17
00:00:50,341 --> 00:00:54,846
[car engine idling, radio plays]

18
00:00:54,929 --> 00:00:57,700
[male reporter 2] ...international effort
is merely a drain on financial

19
00:00:57,724 --> 00:00:59,059
and energy resources...

20
00:00:59,642 --> 00:01:00,642
[Hamilton] Yes.

21
00:01:01,352 --> 00:01:02,352
I'll tell him.

22
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:04,730
Okay.

23
00:01:05,523 --> 00:01:06,523
Thanks.

24
00:01:07,859 --> 00:01:08,860
Did you move at all?

25
00:01:09,277 --> 00:01:10,612
Forward or side to side?

26
00:01:11,196 --> 00:01:12,614
Joe says you owe him a call.

27
00:01:12,781 --> 00:01:13,781
Did he ask you?

28
00:01:14,491 --> 00:01:15,742
I feel like honking a horn.

29
00:01:15,825 --> 00:01:17,745
Yeah, because that will make
loads of difference.

30
00:01:18,036 --> 00:01:19,245
Are you serious?

31
00:01:19,788 --> 00:01:20,788
Stop.

32
00:01:22,457 --> 00:01:23,500
You've started a trend.

33
00:01:29,714 --> 00:01:32,425
Come on.
That's like the fourth blackout today.

34
00:01:33,009 --> 00:01:34,009
Fifth.

35
00:01:37,097 --> 00:01:38,097
Did he ask you?

36
00:01:40,391 --> 00:01:41,391
And?

37
00:01:41,643 --> 00:01:42,644
You know what I said.

38
00:01:42,727 --> 00:01:43,645
I'm not leaving you.

39
00:01:43,728 --> 00:01:45,063
That mission could be years.

40
00:01:45,146 --> 00:01:46,940
You said you could be back in six months.

41
00:01:47,023 --> 00:01:48,191
Do you want me to go?

42
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:51,653
Joe knows what we've been through.

43
00:01:51,903 --> 00:01:53,463
And yet he still wants you on the crew.

44
00:01:55,156 --> 00:01:57,218
- There are other officers.
- Yeah, but he called you.

45
00:01:57,242 --> 00:01:58,242
Why are you pushing this?

46
00:01:58,284 --> 00:01:59,285
Why do you think?

47
00:02:02,455 --> 00:02:04,082
Forget about me and what I want,

48
00:02:04,707 --> 00:02:06,000
which is for you to stay.

49
00:02:08,336 --> 00:02:09,379
Why do you think?

50
00:02:15,009 --> 00:02:16,678
Because you are sweet.

51
00:02:21,224 --> 00:02:22,892
Because people are starving.

52
00:02:26,604 --> 00:02:28,857
Because our energy supplies
are running out.

53
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:33,528
And this mission could unlock
an endless supply of power

54
00:02:33,611 --> 00:02:34,988
that could save us all.

55
00:02:37,282 --> 00:02:38,282
If you go...

56
00:02:39,993 --> 00:02:40,993
you and I...

57
00:02:41,911 --> 00:02:42,911
will survive.

58
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:48,585
I'm afraid if you don't...

59
00:02:50,461 --> 00:02:51,461
No one will.

60
00:03:07,478 --> 00:03:08,563

66
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:36,020
[Schmidt] It's holding for pre-ignition.

for countdown.

crossed here at Mission Control.

00:03:43,681 --> 00:03:45,141

70
00:03:46,601 --> 00:03:47,995
- [tech 1] Status boosters?
- [tech 2] Go.

71
00:03:48,019 --> 00:03:49,288
- [tech 1] The GNC.
- [tech 2] Go.

72
00:03:49,312 --> 00:03:50,312
[tech 1] Power up.

73
00:03:53,691 --> 00:03:56,236
[Hamilton] Commander, Shepard team
standing by for your go.

74
00:03:57,946 --> 00:03:58,946
[Schmidt] On my count...

75
00:04:00,448 --> 00:04:05,203
Three... two... one... mark.

Morning, beautiful.

92
00:07:42,837 --> 00:07:45,173
- Sorry, I woke you.
- No. Look.

93
00:07:47,717 --> 00:07:48,717
I'm working.

94
00:07:49,343 --> 00:07:51,262
I've got a patient today with...

95
00:07:51,345 --> 00:07:54,515
Camptodactyly-arthropathy-
coxa vara-pericarditis syndrome.

96
00:07:55,141 --> 00:07:57,268
- What's that?
- I'll tell you after I do my homework.

97
00:07:59,729 --> 00:08:01,981
I'm getting sick of only seeing you
on a screen.

98
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:05,902
- You okay?
- Yeah.

99
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:08,120
It's the rest of the world
I'm worried about.

100
00:08:10,656 --> 00:08:12,241
You see the same news that I do.

101
00:08:13,034 --> 00:08:14,034
It's madness.

102
00:08:15,953 --> 00:08:17,330
Oil wars are spreading.

103
00:08:18,748 --> 00:08:20,958
Russia is threatening
ground invasion now.

104
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:22,250
Can you believe that?

105
00:08:22,668 --> 00:08:25,213
Ground invasion, which will
waste their oil reserves.

106
00:08:25,796 --> 00:08:26,796
Anyway...

107
00:08:28,132 --> 00:08:30,510
normal life is
hanging by a thread.

108
00:08:32,178 --> 00:08:33,178
You?

109
00:08:35,473 --> 00:08:36,682
We're all on edge.

110
00:08:38,851 --> 00:08:42,063
And we only have enough fuel
for three more firings.

111
00:08:42,605 --> 00:08:44,941
- I remember.
- If this doesn't work...

112
00:08:45,483 --> 00:08:47,985
I can't even think about what happens
down there.

113
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:52,573
I don't think any of us are feeling...

114
00:08:53,824 --> 00:08:54,824
hopeful.

115
00:08:57,036 --> 00:08:58,579
I miss you more everyday.

116
00:09:00,456 --> 00:09:01,457
Like I miss them.

117
00:09:03,042 --> 00:09:04,544
And maybe I'm an idiot...

118
00:09:06,337 --> 00:09:07,338
but I'm hopeful.

119
00:09:08,756 --> 00:09:10,841
And not just for the work
that you're doing.

120
00:09:12,301 --> 00:09:15,304
We can't go back in time
and know what we know now.

121
00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:19,225
But I was thinking...

122
00:09:20,643 --> 00:09:21,811
Maybe when you get back...

CO2, N2, hydrogen, water vapor and methane
at optimal levels.

You know how many pressure leaks
we've had?

142

Not one.

No microbe overgrowth, nothing.

144
00:12:24,201 --> 00:12:26,203
- You know why?
- This is a long speech, Volkov.

145
00:12:26,287 --> 00:12:28,706
Because I disinfect the decks
every 72 hours.

146
00:12:29,039 --> 00:12:31,167
I disinfect the decks, actually.

147
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:33,085
If you have a point, I'd make it now.

148
00:12:33,169 --> 00:12:34,879
There's one part of this station.

We've both heard the reports.

165
00:13:16,295 --> 00:13:19,340

183
00:14:11,392 --> 00:14:14,895
[Stambler] Right this minute, they are
testing a particle accelerator up there,

184
00:14:14,979 --> 00:14:18,816
so we can learn how to make
unlimited energy down here.

185
00:14:18,899 --> 00:14:20,484
But those who have accepted

186
00:14:20,568 --> 00:14:22,945
the Cloverfield Paradox is real...

187
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:25,715
[Schmidt] Shepard holding
for pre-ignition.

188
00:14:25,739 --> 00:14:28,450
Commander, Shepard team standing by
for your go.

189
00:14:28,534 --> 00:14:29,785
[Kiel] Diagnostic mode off.

190
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:31,829
[in Mandarin]
X-Deck modification complete.

191
00:14:33,122 --> 00:14:34,373
[Hamilton] Stabilizer active.

192
00:14:35,165 --> 00:14:38,210
Qinhuangdao, confirm pre-ignition
sequencing authorization.

193
00:14:38,294 --> 00:14:40,814
[Qinhuangdao Control] You're a go
for accelerator pre-ignition.

194
00:14:41,338 --> 00:14:44,091
Huntsville and Qinhuangdao Control,
we'll call you post blackout.

195
00:14:44,174 --> 00:14:46,194
- [Qinhuangdao Control] Copy.
- [Huntsville] Stand by for protocol go.

196
00:14:46,218 --> 00:14:48,154
[female anchor] Why does the accelerator
worry you so much?

197
00:14:48,178 --> 00:14:51,390
[Stambler] Because that accelerator is
1000 times more powerful

198
00:14:51,473 --> 00:14:52,850
than any ever built.

199
00:14:52,933 --> 00:14:55,060
Every time they test it, they risk

200
00:14:55,144 --> 00:14:58,147
ripping open the membrane of space time,

201
00:14:58,230 --> 00:15:00,316
smashing together multiple dimensions,

202
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:02,026
shattering reality.

203
00:15:02,359 --> 00:15:04,153
And not just on that station,

204
00:15:04,403 --> 00:15:05,613
everywhere.

205
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:09,241
This experiment could unleash chaos...

206
00:15:09,617 --> 00:15:11,702
the likes of whi c h we have nev er seen.

207
00:15:12,369 --> 00:15:15,581
Monsters, demons, beasts from the sea...

208
00:15:15,664 --> 00:15:16,784
[female anchor] To clarify,

209
00:15:16,832 --> 00:15:19,209
you believe their efforts
to solve the energy crisis

210
00:15:19,293 --> 00:15:20,920
might unleash demons?

211
00:15:21,045 --> 00:15:22,671
Yeah. Oh, yeah.

212
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:25,466
[Kiel] Volkov, we're ready to take
the Shepard online.

213
00:15:25,549 --> 00:15:27,051
- How's your station?
- Hold on,

214
00:15:27,134 --> 00:15:29,219
I'm calibrating our expensive compass.

215
00:15:29,303 --> 00:15:30,822
[Stambler] And not just here and now...

216
00:15:30,846 --> 00:15:32,264
in the past...

217
00:15:32,348 --> 00:15:35,017
in the future, in other dimensions...

218
00:15:35,893 --> 00:15:37,645
You have no idea how much I would

219
00:15:37,728 --> 00:15:39,355
love to be wrong about this.

220
00:15:39,855 --> 00:15:40,689
[Kiel] Monk.

221
00:15:40,773 --> 00:15:43,213
- [Stambler] If you want to know more...
- Turn that shit off.

222
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:44,359
read my book...

223
00:15:45,819 --> 00:15:47,571
[Volkov] Gyro is calibrating.

224
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:51,075
Our station is good.

225
00:15:51,867 --> 00:15:53,587
You should ask Schmidt,
is his station good?

226
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:54,912
Jesus Christ.

227
00:15:55,204 --> 00:15:56,538
Please, Mr. Monk,

228
00:15:56,622 --> 00:15:57,998
hit us with your holy stick.

229
00:15:58,082 --> 00:15:59,083
[Schmidt] Oh, come on.

230
00:15:59,166 --> 00:16:00,668
- Not now when we're...
- Schmidt.

231
00:16:09,885 --> 00:16:12,846
The farther we travel from home,
the clearer it becomes

232
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:15,891
that there is a power infinitely
greater than us.

233
00:16:16,558 --> 00:16:18,143
Please show Your mercy.

234
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:21,021
And allow the Shepard to work this time.

235
00:16:22,856 --> 00:16:24,984
To provide the energy we need.

236
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:28,362
To prevent our countries

237
00:16:28,445 --> 00:16:29,822
from going to war.

238
00:16:33,075 --> 00:16:35,160
Please, God, be on our side.

239
00:16:35,869 --> 00:16:36,869
Amen.

240
00:16:38,622 --> 00:16:39,622
Amen.

241
00:16:40,874 --> 00:16:42,001
That was righteous.

242
00:16:42,418 --> 00:16:45,546
[mechanical whirling]

243
00:16:51,051 --> 00:16:52,051
Back to work.

244
00:16:52,386 --> 00:16:53,429
Sunday School over yet?

245
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:56,181
Schmidt, power up.

246
00:17:03,313 --> 00:17:04,553
[in Mandarin] Sequence running.

247
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:08,485
[Tam] Thirty to ignition.

248
00:17:11,447 --> 00:17:12,447
Commander?

249
00:17:16,744 --> 00:17:19,872
Three... two... one...

250
00:17:20,289 --> 00:17:21,206
mark.

251
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:24,334
[electrical whirling]

252
00:17:30,382 --> 00:17:32,509
Please don't break up on me, baby.

253
00:17:39,892 --> 00:17:43,395
[electrical whirling continues]

254
00:17:49,151 --> 00:17:52,279
Yes, yes. Yes!

255
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:56,720
[Tam] We have a successful collision.

256
00:17:57,659 --> 00:17:58,786
[Kiel] What's our output?

257
00:17:59,328 --> 00:18:01,038
[Schmidt] We have positive energy flow.

258
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:02,414
For the first time.

259
00:18:02,831 --> 00:18:05,125
Look at this, look at this.

260
00:18:05,209 --> 00:18:07,294
- Holy shit, you did it.
- It's working.

261
00:18:07,377 --> 00:18:10,964
- We are focused at 47 teravolts.
- Oh, man!

262
00:18:11,048 --> 00:18:12,341
Hamilton, viewscreen mode.

263
00:18:15,385 --> 00:18:17,638
- [Monk] Yeah!
- [Mundy] Oh, man! Nice.

264
00:18:18,472 --> 00:18:20,766
Oh, yeah man!
That's pretty.

265
00:18:22,267 --> 00:18:24,269
[electric intensifies]

266
00:18:26,271 --> 00:18:28,273
[power stops abruptly]

267
00:18:29,399 --> 00:18:30,484
[station powers on]

268
00:18:31,944 --> 00:18:33,445
[Kiel] Schmidt, tell me something.

269
00:18:33,779 --> 00:18:34,798
[Schmidt] It says it hit 602...

270
00:18:34,822 --> 00:18:36,448
[glass shatters]

271
00:18:41,912 --> 00:18:43,914
[electric intensifies]

272
00:18:44,206 --> 00:18:45,874
What the hell is happening?

273
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:49,128
[glass shatters]

274
00:18:51,171 --> 00:18:52,381
[bodies thud]

275
00:18:52,464 --> 00:18:54,883
[alarm blaring]

276
00:18:59,179 --> 00:19:01,014
[Tam speaking Mandarin]

277
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:04,893
[alarm blaring]

278
00:19:06,395 --> 00:19:09,481
[metal roars, fire crackles]

279
00:19:09,565 --> 00:19:12,568
- Extinguisher systems are down.
- Then we ventilate.

280
00:19:13,819 --> 00:19:15,821
[alarm blares, steam gushes]

281
00:19:17,239 --> 00:19:19,575
[Kiel] I need 63M open, now!

282
00:19:19,783 --> 00:19:20,617
[Mundy] Oh, no.

283
00:19:20,701 --> 00:19:22,621
Something's wrong here, guys.
It's all scrambled.

284
00:19:24,037 --> 00:19:25,414
[steam blows, door slams]

285
00:19:31,378 --> 00:19:34,214
[wind roars]

286
00:19:44,349 --> 00:19:45,660
[Hamilton] Qinhuangdao, do you copy?

287
00:19:45,684 --> 00:19:47,078
[Volkov] The O2 tanks are leaking.

288
00:19:47,102 --> 00:19:49,146
Our reserves are severely diminished.

289
00:19:49,229 --> 00:19:51,374
- Qinhuangdao, do you copy?
- [Volkov] The systems are scrambled.

290
00:19:51,398 --> 00:19:53,525
There's absolutely no guarantee

291
00:19:53,609 --> 00:19:55,944
any executable will function as expected.

292
00:19:56,028 --> 00:19:58,780
I'm rebooting the comms system.
I'm not picking up anything.

293
00:20:00,490 --> 00:20:01,490
Okay, what else?

294
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:03,660
[Volkov] Life support at 74 percent.

295
00:20:04,077 --> 00:20:05,871
Main power is fried.
This is backup.

296
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:07,831
Temperature is all over the place

297
00:20:07,915 --> 00:20:10,667
and nothing gets better
until Mundy and I get our hands on it.

298
00:20:10,751 --> 00:20:13,512
- [Kiel] We've got gear to fix all this?
- [Mundy] Not by a long shot.

299
00:20:13,545 --> 00:20:15,130
[Kiel] Request an ECL to send supplies.

300
00:20:15,255 --> 00:20:16,608
[Schmidt] This doesn't make any sense.

301
00:20:16,632 --> 00:20:19,527
- The output, massive amount of energy.
- [Kiel] Tam, please kill that alarm.

302
00:20:19,551 --> 00:20:21,154
[Schmidt] There was some kind
of malfunction.

303
00:20:21,178 --> 00:20:22,572
Really Schmidt?
There was a malfunction?

304
00:20:22,596 --> 00:20:23,596
[Hamilton] Kiel?

305
00:20:25,265 --> 00:20:26,265
It isn't there.

306
00:20:28,477 --> 00:20:30,237
[Schmidt] The frequency
for Mission Control?

307
00:20:31,021 --> 00:20:32,021
The Earth.

308
00:20:34,691 --> 00:20:36,652
I... can't find anything.

309
00:20:37,444 --> 00:20:39,780
We must have gotten turned around,
moved during firing.

310
00:20:39,863 --> 00:20:43,242
It's big, blue, full of angry people.
Keep looking, you'll find it.

311
00:20:43,492 --> 00:20:45,953
I've double checked the radio target,
but the target's gone.

312
00:20:46,119 --> 00:20:47,829
Guys, the systems are scrambled.

313
00:20:48,205 --> 00:20:49,456
[Schmidt] Hamilton is right.

314
00:20:49,539 --> 00:20:51,792
It's not here.

315
00:20:52,417 --> 00:20:54,336
We're not picking up any signals.

316
00:20:54,419 --> 00:20:56,672
The entire Earth is not gone!

317
00:20:56,755 --> 00:20:58,195
[Kiel] Cycle the external cameras.

318
00:20:58,382 --> 00:20:59,424
All of them.

319
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:06,139
[cameras beep]

320
00:21:20,779 --> 00:21:22,864
Wait, are we saying
this thing of his

321
00:21:22,948 --> 00:21:25,033
could have thrown us across the galaxy?

322
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:26,910
We knew it was dangerous.

323
00:21:26,994 --> 00:21:29,746
That's why we had to go up in space
to fire this thing.

324
00:21:29,997 --> 00:21:32,249
No, come on.
Bullshit!

325
00:22:22,466 --> 00:22:28,055
[distant signal beeps]

326
00:22:52,746 --> 00:22:55,123
[Volkov] You, did this!
I never trusted you.

327
00:22:55,207 --> 00:22:56,809
[Tam speaking Mandarin]
- [Schmidt] We all did this.

328
00:22:56,833 --> 00:22:58,919
[Volkov] The Earth is gone.
The Earth is gone!

329
00:22:59,002 --> 00:23:00,521
[Mundy] Are you sure
we checked everything?

330
00:23:00,545 --> 00:23:02,315
[Hamilton] Mundy, you've asked
that question six times.

331
00:23:02,339 --> 00:23:03,775
[Mundy] It's a good bloody question,
isn't it?

332
00:23:03,799 --> 00:23:05,943
- [Volkov] This is your fault.
- [Schmidt] Of course you blame me.

333
00:23:05,967 --> 00:23:07,236
[Volkov] Who else made this happen?

334
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:09,155
[Schmidt] We've been working on this
for two years.

335
00:23:09,179 --> 00:23:12,116
- [Monk] Volkov is right, the Earth's gone!
- [Schmidt] You don't know this.

336
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:15,060
- [Monk] Somehow, we did it.
- [Volkov] Look out any goddamn window.

337
00:23:15,143 --> 00:23:18,143
- [Mundy] Maybe we're missing something.
- [Volkov] We're missing the Earth!

338
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:20,232
- [Mundy] This is not our fault.
None of us...

339
00:23:21,316 --> 00:23:24,986
[Kiel sobs]

340
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:51,430
[radar beeps]

341
00:24:06,027 --> 00:24:08,196
[corridor door opens]

342
00:24:10,031 --> 00:24:11,825
Alright, here's what we're up against.

343
00:24:12,451 --> 00:24:14,786
The station's got problems
we don't have tools to fix.

344
00:24:15,412 --> 00:24:17,038
At this point, looking for home

345
00:24:17,122 --> 00:24:18,248
is a luxury for us.

346
00:24:18,331 --> 00:24:20,125
First, we need to survive.

347
00:24:20,208 --> 00:24:22,252
We need to consider, evidence or not...

348
00:24:23,587 --> 00:24:25,338
that we might have ended the lives

349
00:24:25,422 --> 00:24:26,673
of billions of people.

350
00:24:27,090 --> 00:24:29,217
[Schmidt] We didn't destroy the Earth,

351
00:24:29,301 --> 00:24:30,635
we just lost it.

352
00:24:32,429 --> 00:24:34,181
Totally routine day. Copy that.

353
00:24:34,264 --> 00:24:36,308
Mundy, take Schmidt and deal with the O2.

354
00:24:36,558 --> 00:24:37,558
I'm a physicist.

355
00:24:37,684 --> 00:24:39,060
And now you work for Mundy.

356
00:24:39,227 --> 00:24:40,395
Oh, your lucky day.

357
00:24:40,937 --> 00:24:44,107
Tam, you and Monk will search and repair
all power leaks.

358
00:24:44,191 --> 00:24:46,693
Maybe we can get the temperature
under control.

359
00:24:46,776 --> 00:24:48,862
Hamilton, Volkov, test all circuits,

360
00:24:48,945 --> 00:24:50,405
then we can start looking for home.

361
00:24:50,489 --> 00:24:52,491
When the Shepard overloaded,

362
00:24:52,574 --> 00:24:55,368
something went wrong with
the station's orientation system.

363
00:24:55,452 --> 00:24:58,205
- We'll replace the circuits.
- No shit. If that's the problem

364
00:24:58,288 --> 00:25:00,499
It might be the gyro.

365
00:25:02,167 --> 00:25:04,169
Then let's get that fancy compass fixed.

366
00:25:04,294 --> 00:25:06,296
[drawer opens]

367
00:25:08,715 --> 00:25:10,175
- Volkov?
- Yes.

368
00:25:11,593 --> 00:25:13,970
- I found the problem with the gyro.
- What, it's fried?

369
00:25:15,138 --> 00:25:17,641
- It's not here.
- What do you mean, it's not here?

370
00:25:21,603 --> 00:25:23,563
I secured this when we fired the ship.

371
00:25:29,152 --> 00:25:30,695
[Volkov groans]

372
00:25:41,373 --> 00:25:42,499
This look okay?

373
00:25:47,212 --> 00:25:51,216
[shrieking]

374
00:25:51,299 --> 00:25:53,301
[alarm blaring, door opens]

375
00:25:56,888 --> 00:26:00,850
[door closes, shrieking]

376
00:26:05,313 --> 00:26:09,150
[distant shrieking]

377
00:26:21,288 --> 00:26:23,873
[shrieking]

378
00:26:33,008 --> 00:26:35,260
[distant shrieking, door opens]

379
00:26:43,810 --> 00:26:46,855
[distant shrieking continues]

380
00:26:49,816 --> 00:26:50,817
Tam.

381
00:26:55,155 --> 00:26:56,155
[Schmidt] Tam?

382
00:26:58,658 --> 00:27:00,160
- You alright?
- Shh.

383
00:27:10,462 --> 00:27:12,464
[loud shrieking]

384
00:27:13,465 --> 00:27:14,465
What is that?

385
00:27:14,883 --> 00:27:16,444
[in Mandarin]
It's coming from inside the wall.

386
00:27:16,468 --> 00:27:18,970
- In the wall?
- No, walls don't make noises like that.

387
00:27:19,054 --> 00:27:22,057
- We have to open it.
- [Kiel] Volkov, get the tools!

388
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:23,140
[Mundy] Volky!

389
00:27:23,516 --> 00:27:26,144
Before you rip off that panel
and damage God-knows-what,

390
00:27:26,227 --> 00:27:27,246
can we at least discuss it?

391
00:27:27,270 --> 00:27:28,688
[loud shrieking]

392
00:27:28,772 --> 00:27:30,374
[Schmidt] Mundy's right.
It could be dangerous.

393
00:27:30,398 --> 00:27:31,858
- We should open it.
- No!

394
00:27:31,941 --> 00:27:33,234
Who are you to decide?

395
00:27:33,318 --> 00:27:35,737
Stop! We are doing this.

396
00:27:36,488 --> 00:27:37,656
[Mundy] All right, good luck.

397
00:27:40,158 --> 00:27:42,494
[power tool whirls]

398
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:52,462
Three... two... one.

399
00:27:54,464 --> 00:27:56,466
[woman yelling]

400
00:28:01,596 --> 00:28:04,182
[yelling continues]

401
00:28:07,686 --> 00:28:09,854
- We're here. We've got you.
- Hold on!

402
00:28:10,063 --> 00:28:11,999
- [Hamilton] We have to cut her free.
- [Volkov] We can't cut anything.

403
00:28:12,023 --> 00:28:14,484
Those lines going through her body
are power lines.

404
00:28:14,567 --> 00:28:16,587
- [Hamilton] She's dying in there!
- [Kiel] Mundy, cut the power.

405
00:28:16,611 --> 00:28:18,214
- [Kiel] Hold on!
- [Hamilton] She's dying!

406
00:28:18,238 --> 00:28:19,572
[Kiel] We don't have a choice.

407
00:28:19,864 --> 00:28:20,699
[Schmidt] We have a choice!

408
00:28:20,782 --> 00:28:22,659
Stop it! We don't know what that is.

409
00:28:23,243 --> 00:28:25,388
- [Kiel] Shut it off!
- [Monk] We can reroute the power later.

410
00:28:25,412 --> 00:28:26,496
[Mundy] Hold on

411
00:28:27,122 --> 00:28:30,333
- [Kiel] Mundy!
- [Mundy] Module 17 powered down.

412
00:28:30,458 --> 00:28:33,461
- Just breathe. It's okay.
- [Kiel] Power's down. Let's cut her out.

413
00:28:33,545 --> 00:28:35,189
- [Volkov] Monk!
- [Monk] She's bleeding out!

414
00:28:35,213 --> 00:28:37,373
[Monk] I can't do anything
until she's out of the wall.

415
00:28:37,966 --> 00:28:39,551
- Help me.
- Guys, hurry!

416
00:28:40,385 --> 00:28:43,221
Help me... Hamilton.

417
00:28:46,182 --> 00:28:47,517
She just said your name.

418
00:28:47,892 --> 00:28:49,436
[Jensen] What is happening to me?

419
00:28:51,604 --> 00:28:54,733
What's happening to me?
What's happening?

420
00:28:55,108 --> 00:28:56,359
We're gonna cut you free.

421
00:28:56,568 --> 00:28:57,777
- [Monk] Quick.
- Please.

422
00:28:58,737 --> 00:29:01,177
- [Monk] We got to get her out.
- [Kiel] Can you move her leg?

423
00:29:01,364 --> 00:29:03,366
- [Kiel] Okay, got it.
- [Monk] Hurry up!

424
00:29:03,658 --> 00:29:05,201
[Kiel] Mundy, the saw. Quick!

425
00:29:06,494 --> 00:29:07,912
Hold on. Stay with me.

426
00:29:07,996 --> 00:29:10,081
[saw buzzing, Jensen yelling]

427
00:29:11,416 --> 00:29:13,561
- [Kiel] Careful with the pipe.
- [Mundy] That's no good.

428
00:29:13,585 --> 00:29:15,587
- [Monk] Hold her down.
- [Mundy] Careful.

429
00:29:16,421 --> 00:29:17,773
- It's gonna be okay.
- Grab her leg.

430
00:29:17,797 --> 00:29:19,382
[Mundy] This is a mistake.

431
00:29:20,884 --> 00:29:22,244
[Monk] Schmidt, I need more light!

432
00:29:22,802 --> 00:29:24,345
You got her?
Keep her down.

433
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:27,190
- [Hamilton] Breathe, breathe.
- [Monk] Okay.

434
00:29:27,557 --> 00:29:29,350
[pants ripping]

435
00:29:29,434 --> 00:29:31,561
[Jensen yelling]

436
00:29:31,686 --> 00:29:33,480
[Kiel] Get something to strap her down.

437
00:29:33,563 --> 00:29:35,023
- Keep her still.
- [Kiel] All right.

438
00:29:35,106 --> 00:29:35,940
[shot injected]

439
00:29:36,024 --> 00:29:37,108
[Kiel] You're okay.

440
00:29:37,525 --> 00:29:39,277
[alarm blaring]

441
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:41,196
[Jensen panting]

442
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:47,869
[panting continues]

443
00:29:53,041 --> 00:29:55,168
[alarm continues]

444
00:30:01,007 --> 00:30:03,760
[loud explosion]

445
00:30:03,843 --> 00:30:06,137
[car alarms sound]

446
00:30:06,971 --> 00:30:08,973
[explosion sounds]

447
00:30:16,231 --> 00:30:19,651
[louder explosion sounds]

448
00:30:25,949 --> 00:30:29,327
[cell phone vibrates]

449
00:30:38,294 --> 00:30:42,048
[police sirens wail]

450
00:30:42,131 --> 00:30:43,943
[newsman] No official public
statement has been

451
00:30:43,967 --> 00:30:45,760
made about what caused the explosion

452
00:30:45,844 --> 00:30:48,513
that was thought at first to be
a nuclear weapon.

453
00:30:48,888 --> 00:30:50,723
But we are being assured by authorities

454
00:30:50,807 --> 00:30:52,559
that that is not what this is.

455
00:30:52,725 --> 00:30:55,520
[fighter jets soar]

456
00:30:55,603 --> 00:30:56,603
Are you on call?

457
00:30:57,230 --> 00:30:58,230
Good.

458
00:30:58,898 --> 00:30:59,898
Yeah, I saw it.

459
00:31:01,776 --> 00:31:03,778
Has the hospital issued Code Orange yet?

460
00:31:06,823 --> 00:31:07,991
Shaw said what did it?

461
00:31:11,369 --> 00:31:12,787
Jesus Christ.

462
00:31:19,836 --> 00:31:21,480
- [Schmidt] This is madness!
- [Kiel] Calm down.

463
00:31:21,504 --> 00:31:24,090
[Mundy] We can't stay calm.
Not with that woman lying there.

464
00:31:24,173 --> 00:31:25,943
[Schmidt] Who is she?
And what the hell is she doing here?

465
00:31:25,967 --> 00:31:27,260
[Hamilton] She knew my name.

466
00:31:27,343 --> 00:31:28,779
[Monk] What if we're all going mad?

467
00:31:28,803 --> 00:31:30,948
[Kiel] I'm not gonna say it again.
We have to stay focused.

468
00:31:30,972 --> 00:31:32,682
We have other problems to deal with.

469
00:31:32,765 --> 00:31:34,118
[Mundy] Speaking of other problems,

470
00:31:34,142 --> 00:31:36,561
how the hell are we supposed
to find the Earth?

471
00:31:36,644 --> 00:31:38,605
Without the gyro, we're lost.

472
00:31:38,938 --> 00:31:39,938
Any ideas?

473
00:31:41,274 --> 00:31:42,775
Because honestly, I'm stumped.

474
00:31:44,235 --> 00:31:46,235
[in Mandarin]
You're assuming Earth is still there.

475
00:31:46,571 --> 00:31:47,697
Earth disappears.

476
00:31:47,780 --> 00:31:49,782
Station does not feel the same.

477
00:31:50,491 --> 00:31:52,243
A woman appears in the wall.

478
00:31:52,327 --> 00:31:54,996
We're definitely not in Kentucky anymore.

479
00:31:55,079 --> 00:31:56,331
- Kansas.
- Kansas?

480
00:31:56,873 --> 00:31:59,167
Really? Who gives a shit?

481
00:31:59,959 --> 00:32:01,336
People from Kansas.

482
00:32:05,048 --> 00:32:06,633
I don't know what's going on,

483
00:32:06,716 --> 00:32:07,884
but one thing is clear.

484
00:32:08,635 --> 00:32:10,011
The Shepard's done it.

485
00:32:10,094 --> 00:32:12,263
Which means it might also undo it.

486
00:32:12,347 --> 00:32:14,707
Right now, the integrity of the station
is all that matters.

487
00:32:14,933 --> 00:32:17,393
We have repairs that need to happen,
immediately.

488
00:32:17,477 --> 00:32:19,604
Monk will give us an update
when there is one.

489
00:32:19,771 --> 00:32:20,771
Let's get to it.

490
00:32:25,109 --> 00:32:28,613
[high pitched beeping]

491
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:39,832
[in Mandarin]
Meet me at X-Deck in ten minutes.

492
00:32:40,541 --> 00:32:42,710
- Kiel wants me with him...
- I'm done with Kiel.

493
00:32:42,877 --> 00:32:45,755
You and I need to take control
if we're ever going to get home.

494
00:33:04,857 --> 00:33:10,071
[foosball players spin rapidly]

495
00:33:16,953 --> 00:33:18,955
[spinning stops]

496
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:28,381
Hey!

497
00:33:29,007 --> 00:33:30,466
The worms are missing.

498
00:33:34,137 --> 00:33:35,137
Guys?

499
00:33:35,722 --> 00:33:37,348
The worms are gone!

500
00:33:38,182 --> 00:33:40,022
[Schmidt in Mandarin]
Enhance the core density.

501
00:33:40,435 --> 00:33:43,062
[in Mandarin] I did. I told you I did.

502
00:33:43,312 --> 00:33:45,106
We have to think about the fact that...

503
00:33:45,189 --> 00:33:46,024
Bullshit... no...

504
00:33:46,107 --> 00:33:47,167
...there might be a larger problem.

505
00:33:47,191 --> 00:33:48,252
We're gonna solve this thing.

506
00:33:48,276 --> 00:33:49,485
And what if we can't?

507
00:33:50,069 --> 00:33:51,389
[in English] We will, goddamn it!

508
00:33:51,904 --> 00:33:54,157
Who else can fix this up here?
No one.

509
00:33:54,490 --> 00:33:56,951
Now focus and get your shit together.
Understand me?

510
00:33:58,661 --> 00:34:00,788
[in Mandarin]
Speak to me like that again...

511
00:34:01,914 --> 00:34:04,792
and you and I will have a bigger problem
than the Shepard.

512
00:34:05,334 --> 00:34:06,334
You copy?

513
00:34:11,132 --> 00:34:12,425
Give me the wrench.

514
00:34:27,982 --> 00:34:32,445
[door opens, closes]

515
00:34:50,379 --> 00:34:52,381
[yells in shock]

516
00:35:14,654 --> 00:35:15,654
What?

517
00:35:18,032 --> 00:35:19,032
What?

518
00:35:21,994 --> 00:35:22,995
Excuse me?

519
00:35:29,669 --> 00:35:30,669
Yes.

520
00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:36,550
I know.

521
00:35:51,649 --> 00:35:53,651
[computer beeps]

522
00:36:04,078 --> 00:36:06,080

[machine beeps]

527

[gun cartridge clicks]

528
00:36:46,954 --> 00:36:47,954
[Tam] Hey, Schmidt.

529
00:36:48,122 --> 00:36:49,540
Look at these moisture levels.

530
00:36:50,791 --> 00:36:51,834
Huh.

531
00:36:55,004 --> 00:36:56,881
- What are you doing here?
- No.

532
00:36:56,964 --> 00:36:58,507
What are you two doing up here?

533
00:36:59,717 --> 00:37:02,970
- Against Commander's orders?
- I don't answer to you, Volkov.

534
00:37:03,054 --> 00:37:04,305
- No?
- No.

535
00:37:04,388 --> 00:37:06,557
Then who are you answer to?
German intelligence?

536
00:37:06,641 --> 00:37:07,801
Where'd you get the gun from?

537
00:37:07,850 --> 00:37:08,930
[Tam] Please put that down.

538
00:37:09,310 --> 00:37:11,310
- Chancellor Gerlach?
- Put that gown down, Volkov.

539
00:37:11,354 --> 00:37:13,272
Was it Gerlach who gave...

540
00:37:14,106 --> 00:37:15,106
[Schmidt] Stop it!

541
00:37:15,191 --> 00:37:17,443
Who gave you the wartime orders...

542
00:37:17,526 --> 00:37:19,779
[Schmidt] Put the gun down!
You need help, Volkov.

543
00:37:19,904 --> 00:37:21,465
- ...to sabotage the Shepard?
- [Schmidt] Drop it!

544
00:37:21,489 --> 00:37:23,699
Are you crazy?
Put that gun down!

545
00:37:24,951 --> 00:37:27,161
[coughing]

546
00:37:27,245 --> 00:37:28,871
[Volkov gags]

547
00:37:36,545 --> 00:37:37,731
- [Schmidt] Monk!
- [Tam] Help!

548
00:37:37,755 --> 00:37:40,400
- [Monk] How long has be been like this?
- [Schmidt] He tried to kill us.

549
00:37:40,424 --> 00:37:41,777
[Kiel] Tam, why do you have a gun?

550
00:37:41,801 --> 00:37:44,387
[in Mandarin] He came to us on X-Deck,
threatened us with this.

551
00:37:44,470 --> 00:37:45,989
- [Kiel] Lock it away.
- Now theres a gun?

552
00:37:46,013 --> 00:37:47,053
Since when is there a gun?

553
00:37:47,598 --> 00:37:50,226
- [Mundy] What happened, Monk?
- [Monk] What the hell?

554
00:37:50,476 --> 00:37:52,311
[choking]

555
00:37:52,853 --> 00:37:54,188
[Kiel] Do something, Monk!

556
00:37:54,272 --> 00:37:56,083
- [Hamilton] Monk, what's going on?
- [Monk] I don't know.

557
00:37:56,107 --> 00:37:57,400
[Kiel] We have to help him!

558
00:37:58,526 --> 00:38:00,528
[flatline beep]

559
00:38:00,987 --> 00:38:02,071
No.

560
00:38:03,322 --> 00:38:04,322
[Mundy] No.

561
00:38:08,119 --> 00:38:09,870
[vomits]

562
00:38:11,455 --> 00:38:14,458
[crew stomps, worms squishing]

563
00:38:22,633 --> 00:38:23,968
Well, we found the worms.

564
00:38:25,136 --> 00:38:27,638
[flatline beep continues]

565
00:38:30,516 --> 00:38:34,228
[door opens, closes]

566
00:38:35,104 --> 00:38:36,772
[breathes heavily]

567
00:38:41,694 --> 00:38:43,946
[lights flickering]

568
00:39:06,927 --> 00:39:08,179
[Monk] Hamilton, she's awake.

569
00:39:15,686 --> 00:39:18,564
[inaudible dialogue]

570
00:39:29,325 --> 00:39:30,325
Okay.

571
00:39:40,252 --> 00:39:41,545
[door slides open]

572
00:39:44,507 --> 00:39:45,507
[Jensen] Ava.

573
00:39:47,301 --> 00:39:48,886
How are you on this station?

574
00:39:50,554 --> 00:39:52,473
I have the same question for you.

575
00:39:53,349 --> 00:39:54,349
I don't know.

576
00:39:57,978 --> 00:39:59,563
I was heading to X-Deck...

577
00:40:00,815 --> 00:40:01,815
to find Mundy.

578
00:40:02,024 --> 00:40:03,024
You know Mundy?

579
00:40:05,903 --> 00:40:07,196
Of course I know Mundy.

580
00:40:07,947 --> 00:40:09,824
We've been on this station for two years.

581
00:40:10,032 --> 00:40:11,032
Mundy, Kiel...

582
00:40:11,659 --> 00:40:12,659
Volkov.

583
00:40:13,744 --> 00:40:15,913
Jesus Christ, Volkov.

584
00:40:18,749 --> 00:40:19,875
Everyone except her.

585
00:40:23,921 --> 00:40:24,921
Who is that woman?

586
00:40:27,425 --> 00:40:28,425
Who are you?

587
00:40:29,593 --> 00:40:30,928
What do you mean, who am I?

588
00:40:32,179 --> 00:40:33,179
It's me.

589
00:40:34,974 --> 00:40:35,974
Mina.

590
00:40:37,476 --> 00:40:38,519
Mina Jensen.

591
00:40:39,270 --> 00:40:41,355
- I'm the Shepard engineer.
- No, Tam.

592
00:40:42,523 --> 00:40:43,983
Tam is the Shepard engineer.

593
00:40:44,275 --> 00:40:45,651
What are you talking about?

594
00:40:47,695 --> 00:40:50,095
What are you even doing here.
You're supposed to be on Earth.

595
00:40:50,156 --> 00:40:51,407
Why would I be on Earth?

596
00:40:51,490 --> 00:40:53,576
Because you're our civilian coordinator?

597
00:40:54,535 --> 00:40:56,745
We trained together since ExoMars 6.

598
00:40:58,289 --> 00:40:59,474
We're friends.
I'm your friend.

599
00:40:59,498 --> 00:41:00,666
We've never met.

600
00:41:02,042 --> 00:41:03,544
How can you not know who I am?

601
00:41:10,092 --> 00:41:11,385
None of you know who I am?

602
00:41:12,970 --> 00:41:14,013
None of us.

603
00:41:14,638 --> 00:41:18,100
I don't understand.

604
00:41:20,269 --> 00:41:21,353
I don't understand.

605
00:41:21,896 --> 00:41:23,898
[Jensen exhales deeply]

606
00:41:25,399 --> 00:41:27,026
How can you not know me?

607
00:41:28,652 --> 00:41:30,654
How can you not know me?

608
00:41:32,656 --> 00:41:34,450
I'm the Shepard engineer.

609
00:41:34,742 --> 00:41:37,411
[Jensen inhales, exhales deeply]

610
00:41:41,081 --> 00:41:43,083
[speaking Mandarin]

611
00:41:52,801 --> 00:41:53,802
Listen to me.

612
00:41:57,014 --> 00:41:58,014
Ava...

613
00:42:00,434 --> 00:42:02,311
don't trust Schmidt.

614
00:42:02,853 --> 00:42:03,853
What?

615
00:42:04,271 --> 00:42:05,271
It was him.

616
00:42:06,398 --> 00:42:08,234
Schmidt sabotaged the ship.

617
00:42:30,839 --> 00:42:32,841
[door opens]

618
00:42:34,134 --> 00:42:35,134
Commander.

619
00:42:36,762 --> 00:42:37,763
What's going on?

620
00:42:39,056 --> 00:42:40,849
Kiel, have you lost your...

621
00:42:41,850 --> 00:42:42,893
[Tam speaking Mandarin]

622
00:42:42,977 --> 00:42:44,144
You're making a mistake.

623
00:42:45,062 --> 00:42:46,105
Stay out of this!

624
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:54,780
Jensen warned us about you.

625
00:42:54,863 --> 00:42:55,864
The woman in the wall?

626
00:42:55,948 --> 00:42:57,950
- I checked your communication logs.
- So what?

627
00:42:58,075 --> 00:43:00,327
We deciphered your messages from the BND.

628
00:43:00,703 --> 00:43:01,537
The BND?

629
00:43:01,620 --> 00:43:03,622
We trusted you!

630
00:43:03,872 --> 00:43:05,374
For two years, Schmidt.

631
00:43:05,457 --> 00:43:07,337
- What are you talking about, Kiel?
- Two years!

632
00:43:07,376 --> 00:43:09,169
You were ordered by German Intelligence

633
00:43:09,253 --> 00:43:11,005
to keep the Shepard offline

634
00:43:11,088 --> 00:43:12,798
until Russia was neutralized.

635
00:43:12,881 --> 00:43:16,719
- I swear I never received such an order.
- I saw the order! I saw your response!

636
00:43:17,261 --> 00:43:18,762
Have you lost your mind?

637
00:43:18,846 --> 00:43:20,347
Maybe I am losing my mind.

638
00:43:20,431 --> 00:43:22,308
But I will do everything I can

639
00:43:22,391 --> 00:43:23,976
to keep us alive and get us home!

640
00:43:26,270 --> 00:43:27,646
Until I say otherwise,

641
00:43:27,855 --> 00:43:29,064
this is where you stay.

642
00:43:29,523 --> 00:43:31,734
You're trusting her and not me!

643
00:43:32,568 --> 00:43:33,777
You need me, Kiel!

644
00:43:34,278 --> 00:43:35,278
Kiel!

645
00:43:39,033 --> 00:43:40,969
[radio reporter] City wide destruction
has been reported,

646
00:43:40,993 --> 00:43:43,621
stretching from the downtown area
to the residential suburb.

647
00:43:43,704 --> 00:43:45,039
[Joe] Michael, are you safe?

648
00:43:45,289 --> 00:43:47,541
No, I'm headed to the hospital.

649
00:43:48,375 --> 00:43:49,835
It's gonna be a mess.

650
00:43:49,918 --> 00:43:51,754
Listen, can you get this message to Ava.

651
00:43:52,504 --> 00:43:54,882
Tell her I'll to be in triage
for the next 72 hours.

652
00:43:54,965 --> 00:43:55,965
[Joe] Michael, listen.

653
00:43:56,008 --> 00:43:58,010
We're trying to get answers here, b ut...

654
00:43:58,093 --> 00:43:59,093
it's gone.

655
00:43:59,303 --> 00:44:00,346
The station.

656
00:44:00,804 --> 00:44:01,804
We lost signal.

657
00:44:03,265 --> 00:44:04,475
- What?
- I know.

658
00:44:04,558 --> 00:44:05,851
We're scanning everywhere.

659
00:44:05,934 --> 00:44:07,645
It's off comms, off radar...

660
00:44:07,770 --> 00:44:08,770
Did it break apart?

661
00:44:09,647 --> 00:44:10,648
Did the station fail?

662
00:44:10,731 --> 00:44:11,731
We don't know.

663
00:44:12,191 --> 00:44:13,627
Look, I promise I'll get back to you

664
00:44:13,651 --> 00:44:15,069
as soon as I know anything.

665
00:44:15,819 --> 00:44:16,820
I'm so sorry.

666
00:44:17,571 --> 00:44:18,822
Just don't lose hope.

667
00:44:19,531 --> 00:44:20,908
I believe it's still up there.

668
00:44:21,867 --> 00:44:22,867
Somewhere.

669
00:44:24,662 --> 00:44:25,662
Michael?

670
00:44:26,413 --> 00:44:27,414
I'll call you back.

- No pain?
- No.

Not physically.

and these are my parents?

Sorry.

it might grow back?

719
00:47:51,034 --> 00:47:52,202
I don't know.

720
00:47:53,161 --> 00:47:55,080
I don't know what to believe anymore.

721
00:47:56,373 --> 00:48:01,003
[door opens, closes]

722
00:48:01,587 --> 00:48:03,589
[lights flickering]

723
00:48:10,929 --> 00:48:12,931
[door opens]

724
00:48:15,058 --> 00:48:16,768
This your way of apologizing?

725
00:48:23,483 --> 00:48:24,483
Kiel?

726
00:48:27,404 --> 00:48:29,406
[metal thuds]

727
00:48:34,286 --> 00:48:35,286
Kiel?

728
00:48:38,206 --> 00:48:39,791
[thuds continue]

729
00:48:43,503 --> 00:48:48,091
[thuds speed up rapidly]

730
00:48:49,843 --> 00:48:51,261
[speaks German]

731
00:48:53,555 --> 00:48:54,681
[intercom rings]

732
00:48:54,765 --> 00:48:57,035
[Schmidt] I need the whole crew on M-Deck,
as fast as you can.

733
00:48:57,059 --> 00:48:59,353
- Who let you out of the airlock?
- Just get here, now.

734
00:49:02,648 --> 00:49:03,648
What is it?

735
00:49:04,066 --> 00:49:06,068
[metal thuds]

736
00:49:08,487 --> 00:49:09,488
[Kiel] What is that?

737
00:49:11,782 --> 00:49:14,076
[metal thuds]

738
00:49:17,579 --> 00:49:19,247
That's my fucking arm.

739
00:49:20,165 --> 00:49:22,834
[Mundy] Hold it quick!
Hold my arm, please!

740
00:49:22,918 --> 00:49:24,503
[Hamilton] Quickly, come on!

741
00:49:24,586 --> 00:49:25,712
[Mundy] Hold it!

742
00:49:26,421 --> 00:49:27,422
Be easy with it.

743
00:49:28,423 --> 00:49:29,841
[Tam speaking Mandarin]

744
00:49:29,925 --> 00:49:31,009
Are you controlling it?

745
00:49:31,093 --> 00:49:33,154
- I'm not controlling it. It's over there!
- Are you sure?

746
00:49:33,178 --> 00:49:35,323
Yes, I'm sure because I'm giving you
the finger right now.

747
00:49:35,347 --> 00:49:36,515
[Hamilton] How is that alive?

748
00:49:36,598 --> 00:49:38,238
[Tam] Logic doesn't apply to any of this.

749
00:49:38,308 --> 00:49:40,102
One thing is clear.
The overload did it.

750
00:49:40,185 --> 00:49:41,770
None of us believed it was real,

751
00:49:41,853 --> 00:49:43,230
but this is the paradox.

752
00:49:43,355 --> 00:49:44,189
Excuse me?

753
00:49:44,272 --> 00:49:46,858
Particles interacting with each other
across two dimensions.

754
00:49:47,442 --> 00:49:48,694
Okay, I'm gonna sit down.

755
00:49:48,777 --> 00:49:51,279
Two distinct realities in a multiverse...

756
00:49:51,571 --> 00:49:53,490
fighting to occupy the same space,

757
00:49:53,991 --> 00:49:54,992
creating chaos.

758
00:49:56,118 --> 00:49:57,703
These aren't the things we know...

759
00:49:57,995 --> 00:50:00,497
because they don't belong to us.

760
00:50:01,039 --> 00:50:01,873
Jensen.

761
00:50:01,957 --> 00:50:03,542
My communication logs.

762
00:50:08,046 --> 00:50:10,048
Guys, check out my arm.

763
00:50:12,884 --> 00:50:14,886
[scratching]

764
00:50:17,597 --> 00:50:19,277
I think my arm's trying to
write something.

765
00:50:19,349 --> 00:50:21,184
Somebody get a pen. Quick.

766
00:50:21,893 --> 00:50:23,103
[Monk] This is madness.

767
00:50:25,147 --> 00:50:26,147
Go!

768
00:50:26,815 --> 00:50:27,815
That's creepy!

769
00:50:32,070 --> 00:50:33,070
"Cut...

770
00:50:33,196 --> 00:50:36,199
Volkov... open?"

771
00:50:43,999 --> 00:50:45,279
What are you talking about, arm?

772
00:50:45,584 --> 00:50:47,002
[zipper opens]

773
00:50:50,380 --> 00:50:52,090
[light clicks on]

774
00:50:55,177 --> 00:50:57,304
- It's nothing personal, Volky.
- Mundy.

775
00:50:57,679 --> 00:51:00,015
- He was your friend.
- He was about to shoot me.

776
00:51:00,098 --> 00:51:01,858
- Well, you know, before that.
- [Kiel] Guys.

777
00:51:06,063 --> 00:51:07,063
Monk?

778
00:51:08,607 --> 00:51:09,733
Sorry, I can't do this.

779
00:51:10,108 --> 00:51:11,485
Come on. You're the doctor.

780
00:51:11,735 --> 00:51:13,028
[in Mandarin] I can handle it.

781
00:51:34,174 --> 00:51:35,217
[flesh opens]

782
00:51:49,397 --> 00:51:50,690
There's something...

783
00:51:52,776 --> 00:51:54,486
[organs squish]

784
00:51:57,781 --> 00:51:58,615
No...

785
00:51:58,698 --> 00:52:01,660
- [Kiel] What the...
- ...way, Jose!

786
00:52:02,619 --> 00:52:03,619
Come on.

787
00:52:10,418 --> 00:52:12,420
[clicks, device whirls]

788
00:52:17,092 --> 00:52:18,736
So we're hoping that
the piece of equipment

789
00:52:18,760 --> 00:52:20,011
you found in someone's stomach

790
00:52:20,095 --> 00:52:21,638
is what's going to save the day.

791
00:52:22,264 --> 00:52:23,265
Good luck, everybody.

792
00:52:25,350 --> 00:52:26,810
Putting it on the viewscreen.

793
00:52:30,355 --> 00:52:31,982
[Hamilton] Look, there's Cassiopeia.

794
00:52:33,066 --> 00:52:34,568
[Mundy] It's upside-down.

795
00:52:36,862 --> 00:52:37,988
We're upside-down!

796
00:52:39,364 --> 00:52:41,658
Guys, we moved and we're upside-down.

797
00:52:41,741 --> 00:52:43,076
Check the other side of the sun.

798
00:52:43,702 --> 00:52:44,702
Scanning.

799
00:52:52,586 --> 00:52:53,837
[screen beeps]

800
00:52:56,298 --> 00:52:58,425
My arm helped us find the Earth!

801
00:52:58,550 --> 00:53:01,094
[laughter]

802
00:53:01,636 --> 00:53:02,762
Targeting all receivers.

803
00:53:05,015 --> 00:53:07,684
[radio chatter]

804
00:53:09,728 --> 00:53:11,688
I'd clap, you know, if I could.

805
00:53:12,272 --> 00:53:13,752
Let's let them know we're still here.

806
00:53:16,193 --> 00:53:17,670
We could receive, but we can't transmit.

807
00:53:17,694 --> 00:53:19,213
Let's make that happen as fast as we can.

808
00:53:19,237 --> 00:53:21,615
Let's request a shuttle and give them
status on the Shepard.

809
00:53:21,698 --> 00:53:23,325
And have them send us some champagne.

810
00:53:23,867 --> 00:53:25,147
[in Mandarin] Or some dumplings.

811
00:53:25,202 --> 00:53:27,078
Wait! Guys, listen.

812
00:53:27,162 --> 00:53:28,931
[British reporter] Sources say the number
of those killed today

813
00:53:28,955 --> 00:53:31,583
could be even greater than the blitz
on Berlin.

814
00:53:31,708 --> 00:53:34,377
- The fourteen-month-old European war...
- Fourteen months?

815
00:53:34,461 --> 00:53:36,181
[British reporter] ...no sign of
resolution.

816
00:53:36,254 --> 00:53:37,839
This, as China sends warships

817
00:53:37,923 --> 00:53:38,840
further west...

818
00:53:38,924 --> 00:53:41,134
What are they talking about?
What's going on down there?

819
00:53:41,218 --> 00:53:43,138
[British reporter]...from All Chinese
embassies.

820
00:53:43,261 --> 00:53:45,263
All this with nations still reeling

821
00:53:45,513 --> 00:53:48,266
after the destruction
of the Cloverfield Space Station.

822
00:53:48,558 --> 00:53:50,060
[Kiel] Hamilton, is there video?

823
00:53:50,143 --> 00:53:53,223
[British reporter] ...most recent attempts
to create safe renewable energy...

824
00:53:53,772 --> 00:53:55,458
- [Hamilton] Oh, my God.
- [Kiel] Viewscreen mode.

825
00:53:55,482 --> 00:53:58,401
[British Reporter] ...a catastrophic
failure two days ago.

826
00:53:59,069 --> 00:54:01,321
Losing its brave crew of six...

827
00:54:01,404 --> 00:54:03,198
debris from the Cloverfield has crashed

828
00:54:03,281 --> 00:54:04,783
into the Atlantic Ocean.

829
00:54:05,075 --> 00:54:06,826
Salvage crews are en route.

830
00:54:07,452 --> 00:54:09,788
President Usman is set to make a statement

831
00:54:09,871 --> 00:54:12,290
from the Rose Garden at 5:00 PM
Eastern Standard Time.

832
00:54:12,374 --> 00:54:13,374
I don't get it.

833
00:54:14,084 --> 00:54:15,844
[Schmidt] It's much worse than we thought.

834
00:54:16,211 --> 00:54:18,838
It's not just particles of two dimensions
interacting.

835
00:54:20,131 --> 00:54:21,758
We've traveled to another one.

836
00:54:23,176 --> 00:54:24,636
To another dimension?

837
00:54:28,515 --> 00:54:29,557
So, hold on.

838
00:54:31,184 --> 00:54:32,727
If that's not our Earth...

839
00:54:33,561 --> 00:54:36,398
can someone please explain to me
how we're supposed to get home?

840
00:54:36,481 --> 00:54:38,881
[Schmidt] We have to get the Shepard fixed
and fire it again.

841
00:54:39,693 --> 00:54:41,361
What we know about Quantum entanglement

842
00:54:41,444 --> 00:54:42,988
dictates it should bring us back.

843
00:54:43,196 --> 00:54:44,906
Perhaps undo the damage we've done.

844
00:54:45,991 --> 00:54:47,993
[Monk] It doesn't matter
what Earth that is.

845
00:54:48,660 --> 00:54:50,870
We should go down and get help.

846
00:54:50,954 --> 00:54:52,139
[Tam in Mandarin] We need to go home...

847
00:54:52,163 --> 00:54:53,163
to our home.

848
00:54:53,540 --> 00:54:56,251
Look at them. At their war.

849
00:54:56,668 --> 00:54:59,421
That will be us if we don't get back.

850
00:54:59,671 --> 00:55:00,547
[Mundy] I'm with Monk.

851
00:55:00,672 --> 00:55:02,007
I say we go to that Earth,

852
00:55:02,090 --> 00:55:03,300
the one we can see,

853
00:55:03,466 --> 00:55:05,010
and get the hell off this station.

854
00:55:05,093 --> 00:55:06,886
That place cannot save us.

855
00:55:06,970 --> 00:55:07,970
The longer we stay here

856
00:55:08,013 --> 00:55:09,222
the more dangerous it is.

857
00:55:09,889 --> 00:55:12,392
For us and for everyone back home.

858
00:55:18,148 --> 00:55:20,567
[sun rumbling]

859
00:55:25,405 --> 00:55:26,924
[operator] All circuits are busy now...

860
00:55:26,948 --> 00:55:28,533
I can't get through to your home yet.

861
00:55:28,783 --> 00:55:30,035
Circuits are busy.

862
00:55:30,660 --> 00:55:32,537
That means no calls will go through.

863
00:55:33,121 --> 00:55:34,456
I know what it means.

864
00:55:35,749 --> 00:55:37,751
[phone chimes]

865
00:55:47,010 --> 00:55:48,303
My uncle's dead.

866
00:55:52,349 --> 00:55:54,017
There's nothing you could have done.

867
00:55:56,436 --> 00:55:57,479
Molly.

868
00:55:59,898 --> 00:56:01,024
Molly.

869
00:56:02,609 --> 00:56:03,985
We're going to find your parents.

870
00:56:05,278 --> 00:56:07,438
The most important thing right now
is keeping you safe.

871
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:13,161
[glove box opens, closes]

872
00:56:17,957 --> 00:56:18,957
Thanks.

873
00:56:25,173 --> 00:56:26,841
You shouldn't text while driving.

874
00:56:29,469 --> 00:56:30,470
You're a smart kid.

875
00:56:31,388 --> 00:56:32,639
Only in emergencies.

876
00:56:33,807 --> 00:56:34,682
This qualifies.

877
00:56:34,808 --> 00:56:36,226
[phone chimes]

878
00:56:46,069 --> 00:56:47,069
What did this?

879
00:56:51,616 --> 00:56:52,616
We're not sure.

880
00:56:55,078 --> 00:56:56,663
Bad things are happening.

881
00:56:58,081 --> 00:56:59,916
But good people are
going to make it better.

882
00:57:03,837 --> 00:57:06,005
We're going to need a lot of good people.

883
00:57:08,883 --> 00:57:10,885
[door swings open]

884
00:57:14,305 --> 00:57:15,348
[door slams shut]

885
00:57:19,894 --> 00:57:21,187
I'm gonna close the door.

886
00:57:26,359 --> 00:57:28,194
[door cranked closed]

887
00:57:31,364 --> 00:57:32,657
[light switches click]

888
00:57:34,075 --> 00:57:36,077
[cabinet doors squeak]

889
00:57:42,792 --> 00:57:44,002
Let me look at your arm again.

890
00:57:44,752 --> 00:57:46,171
I'll do a better job this time.

891
00:57:53,553 --> 00:57:54,888
[door slides open]

892
00:58:01,811 --> 00:58:02,811
Thanks, Monk.

893
00:58:04,856 --> 00:58:06,441
You got it working, didn't you?

894
00:58:09,235 --> 00:58:10,235
You got it working.

895
00:58:11,070 --> 00:58:12,071
Something went wrong.

896
00:58:17,535 --> 00:58:19,204
Shepard smashed a Higgs boson.

897
00:58:19,787 --> 00:58:20,787
Overloaded.

898
00:58:21,706 --> 00:58:23,166
Somehow you ended up here.

899
00:58:28,254 --> 00:58:30,256
Your dimension crashed into mine.

900
00:58:31,925 --> 00:58:33,718
[power flickers]

901
00:58:36,763 --> 00:58:38,348
Crew must be working on power.

902
00:58:39,265 --> 00:58:41,434
Trying to fire the Shepard again
to get you back home.

903
00:58:43,186 --> 00:58:44,479
Could you do me a favor?

904
00:58:45,480 --> 00:58:46,981
Would you mind mention to your crew

905
00:58:47,065 --> 00:58:49,776
that you escaping my dimension
will trap me in yours?

906
00:58:53,279 --> 00:58:54,572
[Tam] I've been thinking...

907
00:58:54,656 --> 00:58:56,449
When we put out the fire, we ventilated...

908
00:58:57,116 --> 00:58:59,953
What if condensation caused the Shepard
to overload?

909
00:59:00,578 --> 00:59:02,121
Ventilation could fix that.

910
00:59:02,580 --> 00:59:03,581
Run the numbers.

911
00:59:03,665 --> 00:59:04,832
I'll check the circuits.

912
00:59:10,296 --> 00:59:12,298
[door mechanically opens]

913
00:59:14,759 --> 00:59:15,759
[door shuts]

914
00:59:25,436 --> 00:59:27,605
[lining rips]

915
00:59:40,702 --> 00:59:41,828
[laughs]

916
00:59:42,620 --> 00:59:43,620
[softly] Tam.

917
00:59:44,205 --> 00:59:47,083
[lining rips, water splashes]

918
00:59:55,550 --> 00:59:57,885
[pipes rattle]

919
00:59:57,969 --> 00:59:59,929
[water flows heavily]

920
01:00:03,308 --> 01:00:04,392
Schmidt!

921
01:00:04,976 --> 01:00:06,185
[water gushes]

922
01:00:10,815 --> 01:00:12,942
[electric shorts, alarm blares]

923
01:00:16,112 --> 01:00:19,157
M Deck, I need help in Airlock 6.

924
01:00:19,240 --> 01:00:20,617
I can't get out!

925
01:00:22,201 --> 01:00:24,203
[water rises rapidly]

926
01:00:28,291 --> 01:00:31,002
[water gushes rapidly]

927
01:00:36,215 --> 01:00:37,215
Tam!

928
01:00:37,759 --> 01:00:38,760
Hold on!

929
01:00:41,346 --> 01:00:43,973
- Hold on.
- It's jammed. Try and override it.

930
01:00:44,057 --> 01:00:46,017
Tam, we're gonna get you out.

931
01:00:48,895 --> 01:00:50,438
- Hurry!
- It's not working.

932
01:00:50,563 --> 01:00:53,274
Come on, come on!
Mundy, let's do it manually.

933
01:00:55,443 --> 01:00:56,443
Pull!

934
01:00:57,904 --> 01:01:01,199
[gasping]

935
01:01:03,034 --> 01:01:05,828
[metal clanks]

936
01:01:09,749 --> 01:01:11,876
[grunting]

937
01:01:12,585 --> 01:01:13,585
What's happening?

938
01:01:20,927 --> 01:01:21,928
Get her out!

939
01:01:22,887 --> 01:01:25,139
[metal clanks]

940
01:01:30,228 --> 01:01:32,105
[ice cracking]

941
01:01:32,647 --> 01:01:33,647
- Tam!
- Let go!

942
01:01:35,024 --> 01:01:37,110
[wind whooshes]

943
01:01:57,255 --> 01:02:01,134
[somber music]

944
01:02:04,929 --> 01:02:07,807
[Schmidt] Tam figured out what we've
been doing wrong.

945
01:02:07,932 --> 01:02:10,351
Condensation has been throwing off
our numbers.

946
01:02:11,561 --> 01:02:12,937
We needed to ventilate.

947
01:02:20,319 --> 01:02:21,738
[Kiel] We can't stay here.

948
01:02:21,821 --> 01:02:23,823
This dimension is eating us alive.

949
01:02:24,323 --> 01:02:26,617
We need to fix the Shepard and use it
to get home.

950
01:02:27,076 --> 01:02:28,202
We can't.

951
01:02:28,786 --> 01:02:29,954
Not without Tam.

952
01:02:32,957 --> 01:02:33,957
Maybe not.

953
01:02:46,053 --> 01:02:47,263
Are you sure about this?

954
01:02:51,434 --> 01:02:52,727
[phone line beeps]

955
01:02:52,810 --> 01:02:55,229
[operator] All circuits are busy now.
Please...

956
01:02:56,981 --> 01:03:00,443
[music from headphones muffled]

957
01:03:03,821 --> 01:03:04,947
[phone line beeps]

958
01:03:05,031 --> 01:03:06,783
[operator] All circuits are busy now...

959
01:03:09,202 --> 01:03:10,411
[phone rings]

960
01:03:10,495 --> 01:03:11,913
- [Joe] Hello?
- Joe, anything?

961
01:03:12,121 --> 01:03:14,165
[Joe] Not yet, but there's no debris.

962
01:03:14,499 --> 01:03:15,666
That's a hopeful sign.

963
01:03:16,083 --> 01:03:18,085
We're looking everywhere, I promise.

964
01:03:18,169 --> 01:03:19,646
We'll figure out what happened to them.

965
01:03:19,670 --> 01:03:21,070
It's the goddamn paradox, isn't it?

966
01:03:23,174 --> 01:03:25,468
You can't find the station because
it isn't here anymore.

967
01:03:27,178 --> 01:03:28,387
And they do this too?

968
01:03:28,888 --> 01:03:29,972
What's happening here...

969
01:03:30,056 --> 01:03:31,825
[Joe] Michael, I'll call you as soon as
I know anything.

970
01:03:31,849 --> 01:03:33,851
Look, I just need you to write this down.

971
01:03:34,977 --> 01:03:38,272
I need you to contact
Andrew and Nancy Pontanuis

972
01:03:38,523 --> 01:03:39,607
in Philadelphia.

973
01:03:40,775 --> 01:03:42,109
My phone's not going through.

974
01:03:43,027 --> 01:03:44,963
Just Tell them that their daughter
Molly is okay...

975
01:03:44,987 --> 01:03:47,406
[loud rumbling]

976
01:03:47,490 --> 01:03:49,200
[alarm blaring]

977
01:03:51,828 --> 01:03:54,205
[fighter jets soar]

978
01:03:54,956 --> 01:03:57,375
[loud roaring]

979
01:04:00,294 --> 01:04:02,713
- [Kiel] Can you install Tam's algorithm?
- Yes.

980
01:04:03,548 --> 01:04:05,424
- But I want all of Schmidt's work.
- What?

981
01:04:06,175 --> 01:04:07,385
- Done.
- Kiel.

982
01:04:07,802 --> 01:04:09,554
Once we get the Shepard operational,

983
01:04:09,637 --> 01:04:10,847
we give her your work.

984
01:04:10,930 --> 01:04:13,766
We put her in an escape pod
and send her home with the specs.

985
01:04:13,850 --> 01:04:15,518
- What do you need?
- Power.

986
01:04:15,852 --> 01:04:17,496
Parts of the core are irreparably damaged.

987
01:04:17,520 --> 01:04:19,063
What's left isn't sufficient to fire.

988
01:04:19,897 --> 01:04:20,897
How much?

989
01:04:21,023 --> 01:04:22,983
I'd like 210 kilowatts for at least
eight seconds,

990
01:04:23,025 --> 01:04:23,943
possibly as much as 12.

991
01:04:24,026 --> 01:04:25,746
I'd like to take a bath
with identical twins

992
01:04:25,778 --> 01:04:27,458
- and a tub of Rocky Road.
- Figure it out.

993
01:04:27,530 --> 01:04:29,407
Hamilton, get Jensen
whatever she needs.

994
01:04:29,490 --> 01:04:31,410
Let's get this done and get
the hell out of here.

995
01:04:31,951 --> 01:04:33,953
[door slides open]

996
01:04:36,455 --> 01:04:38,749
- You can change in here?
- Thank you.

997
01:04:40,543 --> 01:04:42,628
Nothing of mine would fit you, but...

998
01:04:42,712 --> 01:04:44,422
- try this.
- Thanks.

999
01:04:52,972 --> 01:04:54,557
You know, as odd as it is for me

1000
01:04:54,640 --> 01:04:56,267
to suddenly have you up here...

1001
01:04:57,101 --> 01:04:59,186
I realize it must be much stranger
for you.

1002
01:05:02,064 --> 01:05:04,358
Maybe I'm not the same Ava
you're friends with.

1003
01:05:07,069 --> 01:05:08,195
No, you're the same.

1004
01:05:09,906 --> 01:05:10,906
A little sadder perhaps.

1005
01:05:10,948 --> 01:05:12,199
The situation calls for it.

1006
01:05:27,381 --> 01:05:28,381
Mina?

1007
01:05:31,761 --> 01:05:33,387
Did you know my family?

1008
01:05:33,930 --> 01:05:34,930
Of course.

1009
01:05:34,972 --> 01:05:37,892
Michael... Isaac...

1010
01:05:39,477 --> 01:05:40,477
Ayana.

1011
01:05:42,563 --> 01:05:44,148
And your friend was...

1012
01:05:46,192 --> 01:05:47,818
strong enough to stay.

1013
01:05:48,611 --> 01:05:49,611
Stay where?

1014
01:05:50,071 --> 01:05:51,071
On Earth.

1015
01:05:52,365 --> 01:05:53,449
After the fire.

1016
01:05:55,952 --> 01:05:56,994
What fire?

1017
01:06:00,665 --> 01:06:01,665
The power cell.

1018
01:06:05,211 --> 01:06:08,631
The one... I put in the house
so they could

1019
01:06:09,090 --> 01:06:10,424
have reading lights at night,

1020
01:06:10,508 --> 01:06:12,134
so they would feel safe.

1021
01:06:15,763 --> 01:06:16,763
The fire.

1022
01:06:19,141 --> 01:06:20,351
It killed them both.

1023
01:06:37,910 --> 01:06:38,910
Hi, Mina.

1024
01:06:40,037 --> 01:06:43,207
A little visitor has come to see you.

1025
01:06:43,666 --> 01:06:45,042
Hi, Auntie Mina!

1026
01:06:48,004 --> 01:06:49,171
We love you.

1027
01:06:49,463 --> 01:06:50,673
Sending love.

1028
01:06:52,967 --> 01:06:54,969
[overlapping chatter]

1029
01:06:57,930 --> 01:07:00,016
[gasps]

1030
01:07:05,312 --> 01:07:06,312
Ava...

1031
01:07:09,442 --> 01:07:11,402
in this world, your family is alive.

1032
01:07:13,404 --> 01:07:14,780
They're on Earth.

1033
01:07:19,452 --> 01:07:21,495
That's why you didn't come up here.

1034
01:07:22,997 --> 01:07:24,290
You're down there...

1035
01:07:26,167 --> 01:07:27,167
with them.

1036
01:07:27,293 --> 01:07:29,295
[softly cries]

1037
01:07:38,429 --> 01:07:40,931
If I divert everything non-life supporting
from the station

1038
01:07:41,015 --> 01:07:42,141
I can get us up to 170,

1039
01:07:42,224 --> 01:07:44,185
maybe 180 kilowatts.

1040
01:07:44,268 --> 01:07:45,728
- That's not enough.
- 210, I know.

1041
01:07:45,811 --> 01:07:48,230
I started thinking about what
life-supporting elements

1042
01:07:48,314 --> 01:07:49,231
we could sacrifice,

1043
01:07:49,315 --> 01:07:50,608
which is when I landed on this.

1044
01:07:51,567 --> 01:07:53,360
If I shut down the O2,

1045
01:07:53,903 --> 01:07:55,362
I could get us up to 240.

1046
01:07:55,446 --> 01:07:56,697
Power down the O2 pumps.

1047
01:07:56,781 --> 01:07:57,901
[Monk] There are six of us.

1048
01:07:57,948 --> 01:08:00,367
That gives us two hours of oxygen,
more or less.

1049
01:08:00,451 --> 01:08:02,536
So we turn off the O2 pumps,
fire the Shepard...

1050
01:08:02,620 --> 01:08:03,996
then, with the power generated

1051
01:08:04,080 --> 01:08:05,748
by the now operational Shepard,

1052
01:08:05,873 --> 01:08:07,917
restart the pumps.
That's clever.

1053
01:08:08,459 --> 01:08:09,459
I'm clever.

1054
01:08:10,669 --> 01:08:12,546
Kiel, I need you for a minute.

1055
01:08:21,889 --> 01:08:24,141
Anything you need, I'm here to help.

1056
01:08:24,225 --> 01:08:25,726
I won't let you down.

1057
01:08:26,352 --> 01:08:28,747
We're all dealing with a lot.
We've just got to keep it together.

1058
01:08:28,771 --> 01:08:29,771
They're alive.

1059
01:08:30,689 --> 01:08:33,692
In this place, my children are alive.

1060
01:08:34,860 --> 01:08:36,237
I'll do everything you need,

1061
01:08:36,320 --> 01:08:37,571
comply with every order,

1062
01:08:37,655 --> 01:08:40,775
but if we do get the Shepard to fire again
to get back to where we came from...

1063
01:08:42,368 --> 01:08:43,661
I won't be here.

1064
01:08:46,080 --> 01:08:47,540
You want to take a pod.

1065
01:08:47,957 --> 01:08:50,000
With Volkov and Tam gone,
there are enough vehicles

1066
01:08:50,084 --> 01:08:51,168
- for everyone.
- Ava.

1067
01:08:51,252 --> 01:08:53,420
This goes against regulation,
I know, but I don't care.

1068
01:08:53,504 --> 01:08:54,797
I need to go to see them.

1069
01:08:54,880 --> 01:08:56,006
What about Michael?

1070
01:08:56,090 --> 01:08:58,717
And Jensen said you weren't
on the crew of her mission.

1071
01:08:58,801 --> 01:09:01,011
- That means you're down there, too.
- I know.

1072
01:09:01,095 --> 01:09:03,055
Ava, that's not your family down there,

1073
01:09:03,139 --> 01:09:04,223
that's hers.

1074
01:09:04,682 --> 01:09:06,392
What's gonna happen when you get there?

1075
01:09:08,102 --> 01:09:11,021
You will never understand
what this is like.

1076
01:09:12,189 --> 01:09:13,189
No, I won't.

1077
01:09:14,233 --> 01:09:17,027
But as much as you want to see them,
this isn't right.

1078
01:09:17,111 --> 01:09:18,654
This isn't just about me.

1079
01:09:19,029 --> 01:09:21,699
The Ava that's down there
wants the same thing I do.

1080
01:09:21,782 --> 01:09:22,782
I know her.

1081
01:09:23,492 --> 01:09:25,536
She'll steal energy for her family

1082
01:09:25,619 --> 01:09:28,247
just like I did, and they won't survive.

1083
01:09:29,165 --> 01:09:30,833
I don't just need to see them...

1084
01:09:31,959 --> 01:09:33,794
I need to save them.

1085
01:09:35,504 --> 01:09:37,464
Michael would want me to.

1086
01:09:42,803 --> 01:09:43,803
Okay.

1087
01:09:44,388 --> 01:09:47,975
[indistinct chatter]

1088
01:09:51,604 --> 01:09:52,980
Let's turn off the oxygen.

1089
01:09:53,480 --> 01:09:54,960
The pumps will need to be deactivated

1090
01:09:55,024 --> 01:09:56,543
- from the maintenance ring.
- [Mundy] Yeah.

1091
01:09:56,567 --> 01:09:59,403
That means you'll be
working inside a giant oxygen tank.

1092
01:09:59,486 --> 01:10:00,988
- One spark and...
- Kaboom!

1093
01:10:01,572 --> 01:10:03,699
Yeah. No, I get it.
Kentucky Fried Mundy.

1094
01:10:04,033 --> 01:10:06,353
- [Monk] That's not funny.
- [Mundy] I'll be on my comms...

1095
01:10:07,703 --> 01:10:08,703
Yeah.

1096
01:10:14,001 --> 01:10:15,502
[Mundy] It's gonna be tight.

1097
01:10:17,838 --> 01:10:20,299
Let's look at some the problems
we might come into.

1098
01:10:20,966 --> 01:10:22,927
Listen, Kiel. Trust me.

1099
01:10:23,594 --> 01:10:26,305
Even with one stumpy arm,
I think I can get this done.

1100
01:10:36,982 --> 01:10:38,943
[electric whirring]

1101
01:10:40,527 --> 01:10:42,446
[putty melts]

1102
01:10:51,830 --> 01:10:53,666
All right, Mundy.
What's your progress?

1103
01:10:54,375 --> 01:10:57,086
Shutting down the auxiliary O2 pumps
in Maintenance Room 3.

1104
01:10:57,378 --> 01:11:00,256
[Kiel] I can't understand anything
you just said.

1105
01:11:00,339 --> 01:11:02,299
I'm nearly ready to transfer the oxygen.

1106
01:11:02,383 --> 01:11:04,385
[device beeps, putty melts]

1107
01:11:06,553 --> 01:11:08,264
Okay, we're good.

1108
01:11:09,348 --> 01:11:10,349
Standing by on X-Deck.

1109
01:11:11,684 --> 01:11:13,644
- Ready on M.
- All right, Mundy.

1110
01:11:13,727 --> 01:11:16,146
[metal clangs, steam flows]

1111
01:11:18,023 --> 01:11:19,023
Okay.

1112
01:11:19,358 --> 01:11:20,859
The oxygen is pouring in.

1113
01:11:21,360 --> 01:11:22,444
I can feel it.

1114
01:11:23,112 --> 01:11:24,152
Where's the power, Jensen?

1115
01:11:26,323 --> 01:11:27,366
Test the actuator.

1116
01:11:30,703 --> 01:11:32,329
[actuator powers]

1117
01:11:38,377 --> 01:11:39,920
Mundy, good work.

1118
01:11:40,838 --> 01:11:43,841
I got to say the pure oxygen
in here is sweet.

1119
01:11:43,924 --> 01:11:45,592
[metal clangs]

1120
01:11:45,718 --> 01:11:46,718
Guys?

1121
01:11:47,011 --> 01:11:49,013
[clanging continues]

1122
01:11:49,179 --> 01:11:50,179
Guys?

1123
01:11:51,974 --> 01:11:52,974
Mundy?

1124
01:11:57,438 --> 01:12:00,065
[metal clangs, vibrates]

1125
01:12:01,191 --> 01:12:02,026
Guys?

1126
01:12:02,109 --> 01:12:04,987
Are you having magnetic issues,
by any chance?

1127
01:12:05,112 --> 01:12:06,112
Mundy?

1128
01:12:07,573 --> 01:12:09,575
[putty chittering]

1129
01:12:14,538 --> 01:12:16,540
[metal bangs]

1130
01:12:18,334 --> 01:12:21,170
[chittering continues]

1131
01:12:22,629 --> 01:12:26,717
[metal clangs, chittering]

1132
01:12:33,474 --> 01:12:34,892
[Mundy] Help!

1133
01:12:37,019 --> 01:12:38,019
[Kiel] Mundy!

1134
01:12:39,229 --> 01:12:40,064
[Mundy] Guys?

1135
01:12:40,147 --> 01:12:42,483
[screams and moans]

1136
01:12:45,402 --> 01:12:48,822
[loud bang, explosion]

1137
01:12:50,783 --> 01:12:52,910
[all gasp]

1138
01:12:53,660 --> 01:12:55,871
- [Hamilton] No! No!
- [Kiel] My God.

1139
01:12:55,954 --> 01:12:57,956
[alarm blaring]

1140
01:12:59,458 --> 01:13:01,460
[alarms blaring]

1141
01:13:23,524 --> 01:13:26,819
[papers rustling, distant alarm sounds]

1142
01:13:43,752 --> 01:13:46,112
The maintenance deck gets
more unstable with every rotation.

1143
01:13:46,880 --> 01:13:49,758
It's a matter of time before that thing
rips the station apart.

1144
01:13:51,176 --> 01:13:53,303
The ring's spinning off axis
by 17 degrees.

1145
01:13:56,432 --> 01:13:58,142
[Jensen] Anything more than 25...

1146
01:14:00,185 --> 01:14:01,185
it won't hold.

1147
01:14:02,646 --> 01:14:03,814
We'll all be in pieces.

1148
01:14:05,232 --> 01:14:07,234
So we decouple the maintenance ring.

1149
01:14:08,068 --> 01:14:09,588
[Schmidt] If we're going to survive...

1150
01:14:10,529 --> 01:14:11,447
we have to.

1151
01:14:11,530 --> 01:14:13,740
Not you. Not Jensen.

1152
01:14:14,783 --> 01:14:16,952
To do that job in the time we have...

1153
01:14:19,705 --> 01:14:21,248
it has to be the three of us.

1154
01:14:26,587 --> 01:14:28,589
I want to give you some
comforting advice,

1155
01:14:29,381 --> 01:14:31,758
but I have no idea how this
is going to go.

1156
01:14:32,676 --> 01:14:35,053
Gravity will be unpredictable,
so be sharp.

1157
01:14:35,637 --> 01:14:36,889
Follow my lead.

1158
01:14:40,476 --> 01:14:42,144
The Schmidt that betrayed you...

1159
01:14:43,270 --> 01:14:45,147
you realize he's not me, right?

1160
01:14:51,111 --> 01:14:52,863
[door beeps, opens]

1161
01:14:59,161 --> 01:15:00,161
[Hamilton] Oh, my God.

1162
01:15:14,468 --> 01:15:17,137
[grinding metal]

1163
01:15:18,430 --> 01:15:20,140
This isn't gonna hold much longer.

1164
01:15:21,016 --> 01:15:22,267
[Kiel] Let's get across.

1165
01:15:27,981 --> 01:15:29,316
Monk, get moving!

1166
01:15:36,907 --> 01:15:38,325
The ring's at 20.2 degrees.

1167
01:15:38,408 --> 01:15:41,328
[debris swooshes]

1168
01:15:46,625 --> 01:15:48,335
[Kiel grunting]

1169
01:15:53,298 --> 01:15:54,925
[Hamilton] Monk, you're almost there.

1170
01:15:55,592 --> 01:15:57,192
[Jensen] Twenty-one point five degrees.

1171
01:15:58,554 --> 01:16:00,806
[metal banging, Monk yells]

1172
01:16:06,311 --> 01:16:07,437
[Kiel] Monk, look at me!

1173
01:16:10,190 --> 01:16:11,190
Give me your arm!

1174
01:16:12,401 --> 01:16:13,681
[Jensen] Twenty-two point three.

1175
01:16:13,986 --> 01:16:15,404
Hamilton, you need to hurry.

1176
01:16:17,698 --> 01:16:18,865
[steam blows]

1177
01:16:21,076 --> 01:16:23,120
[Kiel and Monk grunting]

1178
01:16:29,418 --> 01:16:31,058
[Jensen] Twenty-three point one degrees.

1179
01:16:34,006 --> 01:16:36,550
[metal clangs, Hamilton gasps]

1180
01:16:36,633 --> 01:16:37,801
Hang on!

1181
01:16:40,512 --> 01:16:42,323
[Jensen] Twenty-three point four degrees.
Keep moving.

1182
01:16:42,347 --> 01:16:43,627
[Kiel] I'm clearing the debris.

1183
01:16:45,601 --> 01:16:47,144
[metal thuds]

1184
01:16:55,569 --> 01:16:57,195
[door opens]

1185
01:16:59,573 --> 01:17:00,573
Come on.

1186
01:17:08,165 --> 01:17:09,708
[Kiel grunting]

1187
01:17:09,791 --> 01:17:11,084
It's jammed.

1188
01:17:11,168 --> 01:17:13,920
[metal grinding, sparks hiss]

1189
01:17:15,213 --> 01:17:17,758
Twenty-three point nine degrees.
We have to jettison that ring.

1190
01:17:19,926 --> 01:17:21,928
[Kiel grunting]

1191
01:17:31,480 --> 01:17:32,480
What is it?

1192
01:17:35,192 --> 01:17:36,192
Kiel?

1193
01:17:37,861 --> 01:17:39,696
We have to shut down the hydraulics.

1194
01:17:42,407 --> 01:17:43,407
Let's go.

1195
01:17:43,659 --> 01:17:45,259
[Jensen] Twenty-four point two degrees.

1196
01:17:45,952 --> 01:17:46,952
[Kiel slams door shut]

1197
01:17:47,829 --> 01:17:48,931
Wait, Kiel.
What are you doing?

1198
01:17:48,955 --> 01:17:51,291
To decouple the ring, this portal
has to be locked.

1199
01:17:51,958 --> 01:17:53,669
Wait. No, Kiel.
We can do this remotely.

1200
01:17:53,752 --> 01:17:56,296
I'm the commander of this station.
I have to do this.

1201
01:17:57,255 --> 01:17:59,049
You can get the station home.

1202
01:17:59,299 --> 01:18:00,299
You can do it.

1203
01:18:01,551 --> 01:18:02,761
There's no other way.

1204
01:18:03,428 --> 01:18:04,428
You have to.

1205
01:18:07,265 --> 01:18:08,265
It's okay.

1206
01:18:09,059 --> 01:18:12,729
Oh, Jesus!
The ring's at 24.8 degrees.

1207
01:18:12,813 --> 01:18:15,440
[alarm blaring]

1208
01:18:19,403 --> 01:18:20,403
[door shuts]

1209
01:18:23,740 --> 01:18:25,492
Oh. Oh, God.

1210
01:18:26,993 --> 01:18:28,537
[Kiel grunting]

1211
01:18:31,623 --> 01:18:33,263
[Jensen] Twenty-four point nine degrees.

1212
01:18:34,418 --> 01:18:35,669
[Kiel grunts]

1213
01:19:06,575 --> 01:19:08,577
[door slides open]

1214
01:19:09,327 --> 01:19:11,621
[grunts, metal bangs]

1215
01:19:32,350 --> 01:19:34,150
- [Michael] How late?
- [Hamilton] Super late.

1216
01:19:34,811 --> 01:19:37,331
- [Hamilton] Isaac with Jenny?
- [Michael] I'm getting him at three.

1217
01:19:37,355 --> 01:19:39,555
[Hamilton] Thank you.
Oh, don't forget his antibiotics.

1218
01:19:39,858 --> 01:19:42,569
- [Michael] Yes, no I won't forget.
- [Hamilton] Yes, you wont.

1219
01:19:42,652 --> 01:19:45,172
- [Hamilton] No you won't. Okay.
- [Michael] No. I won't forget.

1220
01:19:46,114 --> 01:19:49,117
- [Michael] H ave something in your hair.
- [Hamilton] Where? There?

1221
01:19:49,201 --> 01:19:51,912
- [Michael] No. No, the other side.
- [Hamilton] Did I get it?

1222
01:19:52,788 --> 01:19:54,557
- [Michael] It's over there now.
- [Hamilton] Good? Did I get it?

1223
01:19:54,581 --> 01:19:55,808
- [Michael] You keep missing it.
- [Hamilton] Where is it?

1224
01:19:55,832 --> 01:19:57,518
- [Michael] How do you keep missing it?
- [Hamilton] Oh my God, what is it?

1225
01:19:57,542 --> 01:19:59,270
- [Michael] It's gone. You're good.
- [Hamilton] Are you sure?

1226
01:19:59,294 --> 01:20:02,297
[Michael] You got it a few seconds ago.
I was just being stupid.

1227
01:20:11,473 --> 01:20:13,475
[sighs]

1228
01:20:24,361 --> 01:20:25,946
[phone beeps]

1229
01:20:27,155 --> 01:20:28,240
Hey, beautiful.

1230
01:20:30,492 --> 01:20:32,244
Just in case I don't make it
through this...

1231
01:20:34,371 --> 01:20:37,040
what I wanted to say the last time
we spoke was...

1232
01:20:39,459 --> 01:20:40,460
maybe we'll try again.

1233
01:20:45,715 --> 01:20:47,008
I can't defend the idea now.

1234
01:20:50,512 --> 01:20:52,013
There's no time to think about

1235
01:20:52,848 --> 01:20:55,475
what we could have done
or what we'll do one day.

1236
01:21:00,856 --> 01:21:02,232
The only choice we have...

1237
01:21:04,025 --> 01:21:06,027
is to save the people that we still can.

1238
01:21:07,237 --> 01:21:08,637
[Hamilton] What's our oxygen level?

1239
01:21:08,738 --> 01:21:10,657
We've got 43 good minutes left.

1240
01:21:12,951 --> 01:21:14,661
We'll prep the Shepard to fire twice.

1241
01:21:14,870 --> 01:21:16,630
Once to overload, which should
get us home...

1242
01:21:17,122 --> 01:21:19,040
then again with Tam's equation
programmed in

1243
01:21:19,124 --> 01:21:20,644
which will give us the energy we need.

1244
01:21:21,084 --> 01:21:23,128
Jensen, copy all our data
from the Shepard

1245
01:21:23,211 --> 01:21:24,129
and take it home.

1246
01:21:24,212 --> 01:21:25,812
This should eventually help your planet.

1247
01:21:26,256 --> 01:21:28,341
Schmidt, get the Shepard
to countdown mode.

1248
01:21:29,593 --> 01:21:30,760
Here's Kiel's firing key.

1249
01:21:31,428 --> 01:21:34,139
Jensen and I will take Pod 3 down
before you fire the Shepard...

1250
01:21:34,848 --> 01:21:35,932
and hopefully get home.

1251
01:21:37,267 --> 01:21:38,267
Okay.

1252
01:21:39,436 --> 01:21:40,436
Okay.

1253
01:22:03,335 --> 01:22:04,961
[cabinet breaks open]

1254
01:22:21,686 --> 01:22:22,686
[Jensen] Ava?

1255
01:22:23,480 --> 01:22:24,564
[loud thud]

1256
01:22:32,238 --> 01:22:34,240

[breathes heavily]

1258
01:22:54,177 --> 01:22:55,177
Shit.

1259
01:22:55,303 --> 01:22:56,303
Jensen.

1260
01:23:11,861 --> 01:23:14,406
[pants heavily]

1261
01:23:15,240 --> 01:23:16,240
No.

1262
01:23:26,209 --> 01:23:29,337
[door slides open, closes]

1263
01:23:32,465 --> 01:23:34,175
We all set on X-Deck?

1264
01:23:40,974 --> 01:23:42,225
What are you doing?

1265
01:23:42,767 --> 01:23:44,144
I need the firing keys.

1266
01:23:45,895 --> 01:23:47,647
I can't let you take the Shepard.

1267
01:23:50,358 --> 01:23:51,609
I can't do that.

1268
01:23:52,944 --> 01:23:54,487
It's not a request, Monk.

1269
01:23:54,779 --> 01:23:56,781
Please. Jensen.

1270
01:23:57,741 --> 01:23:59,034
[echoing gunshot]

1271
01:24:02,787 --> 01:24:05,248
[Jensen] I'm sorry, but I need that key.

1272
01:24:10,962 --> 01:24:12,964
[door slides open]

1273
01:24:18,261 --> 01:24:20,263
[breathes heavily]

1274
01:24:22,348 --> 01:24:23,348
No.

1275
01:24:24,059 --> 01:24:25,059
Monk!

1276
01:24:25,685 --> 01:24:26,978
Okay. No.

1277
01:24:38,073 --> 01:24:39,824
[echoing gunshot]

1278
01:24:40,867 --> 01:24:43,267
I won't let you take the Shepard
away from my world, Schmidt.

1279
01:24:44,704 --> 01:24:45,955
Jensen! Please.

1280
01:24:46,039 --> 01:24:47,332
Why have you come back?

1281
01:24:48,291 --> 01:24:49,542
You could have gone home.

1282
01:24:50,460 --> 01:24:52,587
- We were a crew.
- We were never a crew.

1283
01:24:52,670 --> 01:24:54,005
Stay away from her, Hamilton.

1284
01:24:54,089 --> 01:24:56,424
This had to happen from the moment
you wiped my crew,

1285
01:24:56,508 --> 01:24:57,967
my station, from existence.

1286
01:24:58,551 --> 01:25:01,012
- No.
- You can't have it both ways, Ava.

1287
01:25:01,971 --> 01:25:03,890
Your family here, but the Shepard there.

1288
01:25:03,973 --> 01:25:05,391
You have everything you needed!

1289
01:25:05,475 --> 01:25:07,227
We couldn't rebuild fast enough.
Think.

1290
01:25:07,310 --> 01:25:09,312
People are dying down there, every day.

1291
01:25:09,771 --> 01:25:11,022
You're going to kill us?

1292
01:25:11,689 --> 01:25:14,400
If you're asking me if I am willing
to kill three people...

1293
01:25:15,693 --> 01:25:17,153
to save eight billion...

1294
01:25:20,323 --> 01:25:21,323
wouldn't you?

1295
01:25:26,955 --> 01:25:28,081
[loud thud, gunshot]

1296
01:25:28,957 --> 01:25:29,957
[Schmidt] Go!

1297
01:25:30,542 --> 01:25:31,584
Go!

1298
01:25:33,336 --> 01:25:36,172
[grunting]

1299
01:25:37,090 --> 01:25:38,591

[door shuts]

1305
01:26:27,640 --> 01:26:28,640
Ava...

1306
01:26:29,976 --> 01:26:31,603
don't fail them again.

1307
01:26:34,063 --> 01:26:35,940
That is your family down there.

1308
01:26:45,825 --> 01:26:46,825
The same kids.

1309
01:26:48,661 --> 01:26:50,038
The same man you married.

1310
01:26:56,836 --> 01:26:59,589
[video chatter]

1311
01:27:04,260 --> 01:27:06,721
[Jensen] You don't know how bad it is
down there.

1312
01:27:10,391 --> 01:27:11,976
It'll only get worse.

1313
01:27:23,446 --> 01:27:25,240
Listen to their voices, Ava.

1314
01:27:28,284 --> 01:27:29,535
They need you.

1315
01:27:41,047 --> 01:27:43,633
You may be willing to kill
your children again...

1316
01:27:49,764 --> 01:27:52,100
but I won't let those people
down there die.

1317
01:27:55,186 --> 01:27:58,439

[grunting, yelling]

1327
01:28:34,183 --> 01:28:36,227
[child] Yes! I learned my back handspring.

1328
01:28:37,437 --> 01:28:41,274
[gunshots]

1329
01:28:42,984 --> 01:28:44,485

[Jensen panting]

1333
01:28:55,371 --> 01:28:56,371
Ava!

[glass cracks]

1335
01:29:00,376 --> 01:29:01,376
No!

[chatter continues]

1341
01:29:50,510 --> 01:29:51,928
[Ava] I don't know where to start.

1342
01:29:57,850 --> 01:30:00,061
But this isn't my world?

1343
01:30:05,233 --> 01:30:06,609
As much as I want it to be.

1344
01:30:09,153 --> 01:30:10,153
It isn't mine.

1345
01:30:18,788 --> 01:30:19,788
It's yours.

1346
01:30:21,707 --> 01:30:22,750
Ava...

1347
01:30:24,502 --> 01:30:26,212
you're not losing your mind, I promise.

1348
01:30:29,465 --> 01:30:30,967
There's no other way to say this.

1349
01:30:33,970 --> 01:30:34,970
I'm you.

1350
01:30:37,974 --> 01:30:39,016
I have to be quick.

1351
01:30:39,851 --> 01:30:42,270
Attached to this message,
are detailed construction

1352
01:30:42,353 --> 01:30:44,772
and operation plans
for the Shepard Accelerator.

1353
01:30:45,857 --> 01:30:47,692
I'm praying it helps your planet.

1354
01:30:48,568 --> 01:30:50,403
I have the same hope for mine.

1355
01:30:54,282 --> 01:30:55,783
I need to say two things

1356
01:30:56,576 --> 01:30:57,910
that won't make sense to you.

1357
01:30:58,870 --> 01:31:00,496
But please, hear me...

1358
01:31:01,164 --> 01:31:03,916
and understand how important
these both are.

1359
01:31:06,294 --> 01:31:07,294
First...

1360
01:31:09,172 --> 01:31:11,674
if you've installed a power cell
at the house...

1361
01:31:12,884 --> 01:31:14,635
take it out, now.

1362
01:31:15,970 --> 01:31:18,139
It's wrong, and it's dangerous...

1363
01:31:18,222 --> 01:31:19,348
and if these plans work,

1364
01:31:19,432 --> 01:31:21,350
you won't need to siphon power anyway.

1365
01:31:23,895 --> 01:31:24,895
And two...

1366
01:31:27,982 --> 01:31:29,692
Whatever you're doing right now...

1367
01:31:31,194 --> 01:31:32,487
whatever meeting you're in

1368
01:31:32,570 --> 01:31:34,739
or wherever you're going, stop.

1369
01:31:36,491 --> 01:31:39,285
Go to your husband and your children...

1370
01:31:40,953 --> 01:31:41,996
right now.

1371
01:31:44,081 --> 01:31:45,081
Go to them...

1372
01:31:45,958 --> 01:31:46,958
and hold them.

1373
01:31:49,003 --> 01:31:51,130
Hold them for as long as you can.

1374
01:31:53,090 --> 01:31:55,134
Kiss them and love them,

1375
01:31:55,218 --> 01:31:57,303
and know how blessed you are...

1376
01:31:58,346 --> 01:31:59,972
to have them in your life.

1377
01:32:02,350 --> 01:32:03,643
That's all there is.

1378
01:32:07,063 --> 01:32:08,356
That's all there is.

[Huntsville] Cloverfield, do you copy?

1390
01:33:20,344 --> 01:33:22,430
Huntsville, this is Hamilton.
Can you hear us?

1391
01:33:22,763 --> 01:33:24,323
[Huntsville] Where have you guys been?

1392
01:33:24,557 --> 01:33:26,350
That's something of a conversation.

1393
01:33:27,393 --> 01:33:29,033
[Hamilton] We can explain later.
Listen...

1394
01:33:29,312 --> 01:33:31,522
I'd rush an emergency team
up here for repairs.

1395
01:33:32,523 --> 01:33:34,233
Schmidt and I are all that's left.

[Huntsville] What did you do up there?

1399
01:33:42,783 --> 01:33:44,327
What's going on with the Shepard?

1400
01:33:45,119 --> 01:33:46,120

You did? You found them?

1412
01:35:15,418 --> 01:35:16,627
[Joe] Ava, the station.

1413
01:35:16,711 --> 01:35:17,753
We made contact.

She's coming back.

1417
01:35:26,429 --> 01:35:28,013
You're having her come back to Earth?

1418
01:35:28,597 --> 01:35:30,015
Do they know what's happening here?

1419
01:35:30,099 --> 01:35:31,392
[Joe] No, there wasn't time.

1420
01:35:31,475 --> 01:35:32,727
We lost contact.

1421
01:35:38,649 --> 01:35:40,210
[Joe] Listen, just get to the
Delaware coast.

1422
01:35:40,234 --> 01:35:41,569
She splashes down at 4:30.

1423
01:35:41,777 --> 01:35:44,214
- [Michael] Have you lost your mind?
- [Joe] The station's been through hell.

1424
01:35:44,238 --> 01:35:45,958
You're having her come back
to these things?

1425
01:35:46,031 --> 01:35:47,533
[Joe] There's nothing we can do.

1426
01:35:47,616 --> 01:35:48,909
They couldn't stay up there.

There is a choice!
Tell them not to come back!

1430
01:35:57,084 --> 01:35:59,964
- [Joe] You have to listen to me.
- [Michael] Tell them not to come back!

1431
