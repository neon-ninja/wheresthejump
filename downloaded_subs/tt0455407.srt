1
00:01:44,188 --> 00:01:46,981
Um, Dr. Dutten,

2
00:01:47,065 --> 00:01:49,108
- my aunt's in town.
- Mm-hmm.

3
00:01:49,193 --> 00:01:51,277
And she's sick, too.

4
00:01:51,361 --> 00:01:53,571
I'm gonna need you to stay late tonight.

5
00:01:53,655 --> 00:01:55,573
- Oh. You are?
- You know, you should probably

6
00:01:55,657 --> 00:01:57,283
text your Aunt Scotty

7
00:01:57,367 --> 00:01:59,911
and tell him you can't make it
to the baseball game today.

8
00:01:59,995 --> 00:02:01,579
Wait a second.

9
00:02:01,663 --> 00:02:03,915
- Okay, look, Scotty and I, we're not-
- Oh, come on, Becca.

10
00:02:03,999 --> 00:02:05,958
- I mean-
- It's the worse-kept secret in town.

11
00:02:06,043 --> 00:02:07,960
Now, that is saying a lot.

12
00:02:08,045 --> 00:02:10,421
Go on.
Get outta here.

13
00:02:10,506 --> 00:02:11,756
Go have some fun.

14
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,050
Thanks, Dr. Dutten.

15
00:02:28,565 --> 00:02:31,442
Well, I don't care what the calendar says.

16
00:02:31,527 --> 00:02:33,528
Opening day-
That's the first day of spring.

17
00:02:33,612 --> 00:02:36,656
No, no, no.
The sheriff never pays for coffee.

18
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:38,616
Well, that's kind of you, Ben.

19
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:40,827
But the principal still has to pay
his parking tickets.

20
00:02:41,912 --> 00:02:43,496
- Start him a tab.
- Yes, sir.

21
00:02:51,547 --> 00:02:53,422
Kid throws fast.

22
00:02:53,507 --> 00:02:55,174
Just like he drives.

23
00:02:55,259 --> 00:02:58,010
Nice pitch, Scotty.

24
00:02:58,095 --> 00:03:00,346
Come on, man! Come on, guys!

25
00:03:04,393 --> 00:03:05,810
Strike two!

26
00:03:05,894 --> 00:03:08,062
Whoo! Yeah!

27
00:03:20,659 --> 00:03:22,785
Center field.

28
00:03:25,664 --> 00:03:27,373
Oh, Jesus Christ.

29
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:32,128
Hey, Tommy!

30
00:03:34,298 --> 00:03:36,215
- Stay there.
- What's he doing?

31
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:37,842
- Boys, get in the dugout.
- Move it off.

32
00:03:37,926 --> 00:03:39,552
- Get off!
- Bring it in. Bring it in.

33
00:03:39,636 --> 00:03:41,762
Get them off the field.

34
00:03:41,847 --> 00:03:43,347
Get them in the dugout, Principal.

35
00:03:43,432 --> 00:03:45,933
Rory. Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.

36
00:03:46,018 --> 00:03:48,936
Hey, Rory, we got
a ballgame going on here.

37
00:03:49,021 --> 00:03:51,272
We're playing ball,
and you come out with a gun?

38
00:03:51,356 --> 00:03:54,358
What the hell are you doing?

39
00:03:54,443 --> 00:03:56,193
Aw, Ror.

40
00:03:56,278 --> 00:03:58,738
You're drunk, that's all.

41
00:03:58,822 --> 00:04:01,532
All right? Let's just lay the gun down.

42
00:04:03,702 --> 00:04:06,579
Rory, lay the gun down.

43
00:04:06,663 --> 00:04:09,290
Hmm? Lay it down.

44
00:04:11,752 --> 00:04:14,045
Hell, Rory, come on.
Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa.

45
00:04:14,129 --> 00:04:15,463
Rory?

46
00:04:18,342 --> 00:04:21,010
Now, you lay that gun down.

47
00:04:25,682 --> 00:04:26,974
Rory?

48
00:04:30,729 --> 00:04:32,647
Oh, my God.

49
00:05:07,516 --> 00:05:10,101
I'll have blood alcohol for you in the morning.

50
00:05:11,895 --> 00:05:13,813
A full tox screen will take about a week.

51
00:05:16,191 --> 00:05:18,192
How are you holding up, David?

52
00:05:20,362 --> 00:05:22,113
Peggy here yet?

53
00:05:22,197 --> 00:05:24,198
She just walked in with her boy.

54
00:05:27,077 --> 00:05:30,663
David, perhaps now is not the best time.

55
00:05:32,374 --> 00:05:34,917
Son, settle down.

56
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:38,921
Hey, Curt.

57
00:05:40,132 --> 00:05:42,133
Uh...

58
00:05:42,217 --> 00:05:44,093
I'm so sorry.

59
00:05:46,471 --> 00:05:48,264
I liked Rory. I liked him a lot.

60
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:50,141
What was he doing out there?

61
00:05:51,268 --> 00:05:53,144
He had been drinking, that's all.

62
00:05:53,228 --> 00:05:54,645
Rory quit two years ago.

63
00:05:54,730 --> 00:05:57,815
You know how proud he was of that.

64
00:05:57,899 --> 00:06:00,735
Is that what you're saying,
that he was drunk?

65
00:06:00,819 --> 00:06:03,154
- Is that what you're telling people?
- No.

66
00:06:03,238 --> 00:06:06,657
That you had to do it-
had to shoot the town drunk.

67
00:07:40,335 --> 00:07:42,545
You did the right thing.

68
00:07:45,382 --> 00:07:47,133
I need a new blade for this.

69
00:07:47,217 --> 00:07:49,677
Hey, David.

70
00:07:51,346 --> 00:07:54,181
You did the right thing.

71
00:08:07,404 --> 00:08:09,238
You should be sleeping.

72
00:08:18,999 --> 00:08:20,916
Sheriff's Department.

73
00:08:21,001 --> 00:08:22,585
No, ma'am,
we can't comment on that.

74
00:08:22,669 --> 00:08:25,421
That's an ongoing investigation.

75
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:28,465
No, ma'am, the sheriff
is not here right now,

76
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:31,468
but I can see if the deputy will-

77
00:08:31,553 --> 00:08:35,139
Amateur.

78
00:08:35,223 --> 00:08:38,726
Sheriff's Department.
Mm-hmm.

79
00:08:38,810 --> 00:08:42,438
That's the medical examiner on line two.

80
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:47,985
Morning, Jim.
What have we got?

81
00:08:48,069 --> 00:08:50,988
The toxicology reports are in.
The results are negative.

82
00:08:51,072 --> 00:08:52,698
- Come again?
- There was no alcohol-

83
00:08:52,782 --> 00:08:55,159
No, I heard what you said,
Jim, but that's not right.

84
00:08:55,243 --> 00:08:58,787
- Rory was-
- David, we did the test twice.

85
00:08:58,872 --> 00:09:01,540
Rory wasn't drunk.
There was no alcohol in his bloodstream.

86
00:09:01,625 --> 00:09:04,752
We'll get the drug results
back in a couple of days, maybe a week.

87
00:09:04,836 --> 00:09:06,587
Yeah, okay.

88
00:09:06,671 --> 00:09:08,631
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

89
00:09:08,715 --> 00:09:10,758
Do you want this car...

90
00:09:13,011 --> 00:09:14,762
Bring it down here.

91
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,080
Ben?

92
00:09:42,958 --> 00:09:44,083
Ben!

93
00:09:48,171 --> 00:09:50,047
Hey.

94
00:09:53,218 --> 00:09:55,844
Hey, Ben. Ben!

95
00:09:57,347 --> 00:09:58,847
Ben!

96
00:09:58,932 --> 00:10:01,016
Hey. You all right?

97
00:10:04,646 --> 00:10:07,231
Don't worry. The, uh...

98
00:10:07,315 --> 00:10:09,316
kids are resilient.

99
00:10:09,401 --> 00:10:11,360
They're gonna be all right.

100
00:10:11,444 --> 00:10:13,362
Yeah.

101
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:15,447
I'm late. I gotta go.

102
00:10:17,492 --> 00:10:19,785
- Deardra. Bill.
- Hey, Judy.

103
00:10:19,869 --> 00:10:22,454
Little man.
How y'all doing?

104
00:10:22,539 --> 00:10:24,748
Uh, would you mind
taking a look at Bill?

105
00:10:24,833 --> 00:10:26,750
- Sure. What's wrong?
- I don't know.

106
00:10:26,835 --> 00:10:30,504
He's just-
He's not right.

107
00:10:33,967 --> 00:10:36,427
How are you feeling, Bill?

108
00:10:36,511 --> 00:10:38,887
Any pain or discomfort?

109
00:10:40,432 --> 00:10:42,308
Bill?

110
00:10:42,392 --> 00:10:45,227
She worries too much. I'm fine.

111
00:10:45,312 --> 00:10:47,313
Just a little tired.

112
00:10:47,397 --> 00:10:49,148
You got any plans this weekend?

113
00:10:50,984 --> 00:10:53,819
She worries too much. I'm fine.

114
00:10:53,903 --> 00:10:56,488
Just a little tired.

115
00:10:56,573 --> 00:10:58,782
His vitals are fine.

116
00:10:58,867 --> 00:11:02,453
But, you know, I've gotta see a patient
in Cedar Rapids on Monday.

117
00:11:02,537 --> 00:11:04,621
I wanna take Bill in to get a CT scan.

118
00:11:04,706 --> 00:11:05,998
- Monday?
- Yeah.

119
00:11:06,082 --> 00:11:09,168
Let's just make sure it's nothing serious.

120
00:11:09,252 --> 00:11:10,669
- Okay.
- Okay?

121
00:11:10,754 --> 00:11:12,463
You need me, you call me.

122
00:11:12,547 --> 00:11:13,881
Day or night.

123
00:11:13,965 --> 00:11:15,049
- Okay?
- Thanks, Judy.

124
00:11:15,133 --> 00:11:16,633
See you, Nicholas.

125
00:11:16,718 --> 00:11:19,094
- Bye, Judy.
- Bye, Bill!

126
00:11:57,217 --> 00:11:59,551
What's Dad doing?

127
00:12:01,429 --> 00:12:03,597
Wait here, Nicholas.

128
00:12:37,674 --> 00:12:39,466
William!

129
00:12:45,348 --> 00:12:46,598
William?

130
00:12:54,357 --> 00:12:56,483
William, what are you doing?

131
00:13:24,345 --> 00:13:25,679
William?

132
00:13:32,687 --> 00:13:33,770
William!

133
00:13:34,689 --> 00:13:37,274
Oh, God.

134
00:13:37,358 --> 00:13:39,109
Nicholas!

135
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:47,659
Nicholas?

136
00:13:54,292 --> 00:13:56,335
Nicholas.

137
00:14:00,173 --> 00:14:01,173
Nicholas!

138
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:12,392
- Nicholas, are you okay?
- Shh, shh.

139
00:14:15,939 --> 00:14:17,898
Nicholas, what happened?

140
00:14:19,526 --> 00:14:20,817
It's Dad.

141
00:14:20,902 --> 00:14:23,111
Wh-Where's Dad?

142
00:14:23,196 --> 00:14:25,072
What happened?

143
00:14:25,156 --> 00:14:26,657
Honey, please, talk to me.

144
00:14:26,741 --> 00:14:28,784
Please.

145
00:14:30,078 --> 00:14:32,079
He has a knife.

146
00:14:33,414 --> 00:14:35,374
Oh, my God.

147
00:14:40,296 --> 00:14:41,755
Stay back.

148
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:43,298
Stay right there.

149
00:15:21,879 --> 00:15:23,797
William!

150
00:15:25,133 --> 00:15:26,300
William!

151
00:15:36,519 --> 00:15:38,228
William!

152
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:43,066
William, please, don't do this!

153
00:15:44,736 --> 00:15:47,362
William, please let us out!

154
00:16:11,054 --> 00:16:12,888
Hello.

155
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:14,514
Mmm.

156
00:16:16,309 --> 00:16:18,518
I'm coming.

157
00:16:20,146 --> 00:16:21,772
What is it?

158
00:16:23,066 --> 00:16:24,983
Number 1, take the full pressure.

159
00:16:25,068 --> 00:16:27,277
All right, team.
Get me some power.

160
00:16:27,362 --> 00:16:29,279
- Oh, my God.
- The garage is lit up, too.

161
00:16:29,364 --> 00:16:31,782
- Deardra!
- Tom, they get out?

162
00:16:31,866 --> 00:16:34,785
Not Deardra and Nicholas.
Just Bill.

163
00:16:34,911 --> 00:16:37,704
- I need two men on that Engine 3 quarter, south side.
- On it.

164
00:16:37,789 --> 00:16:40,374
When we got here, there was
an empty gas can just sitting out front.

165
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:43,377
And Bill- Well, he was mowing the goddamn lawn.

166
00:16:43,461 --> 00:16:46,880
David, Deardra and Nicholas
were upstairs locked inside a closet.

167
00:16:46,964 --> 00:16:49,132
Bill! Bill!

168
00:16:49,217 --> 00:16:51,009
Bill?

169
00:16:51,094 --> 00:16:53,470
What the hell happened here?

170
00:16:55,890 --> 00:16:57,307
- Oh, my God.
- Judy.

171
00:16:57,392 --> 00:16:58,350
Oh, God.

172
00:16:58,434 --> 00:17:00,143
- Judy, come on.
- No.

173
00:17:00,228 --> 00:17:02,437
- What the fuck have you done?
- Judy, come on.

174
00:17:02,522 --> 00:17:04,481
- Oh! Oh, David!
- Shh.

175
00:17:04,565 --> 00:17:07,025
Oh, God!

176
00:17:08,903 --> 00:17:10,153
Deardra!

177
00:17:10,238 --> 00:17:13,073
Oh, my God!

178
00:17:13,157 --> 00:17:14,991
Deardra!

179
00:17:40,893 --> 00:17:42,561
What the hell?

180
00:17:47,483 --> 00:17:49,484
What the hell?

181
00:17:52,947 --> 00:17:54,072
What you got?

182
00:18:00,496 --> 00:18:01,830
Shit!

183
00:18:01,914 --> 00:18:03,540
Oh, my God.

184
00:18:05,042 --> 00:18:08,128
Russ, you get in touch
with Sheriff Byrnes in Cedar Rapids?

185
00:18:11,132 --> 00:18:13,049
- Russ?
- Uh, yeah.

186
00:18:13,134 --> 00:18:15,469
State troopers are coming this afternoon
to pick him up for transfer.

187
00:18:15,553 --> 00:18:17,304
How long has he been playing statue?

188
00:18:17,388 --> 00:18:19,347
A couple hours now.

189
00:18:21,017 --> 00:18:23,226
The same look Rory gave me.

190
00:18:23,311 --> 00:18:25,645
The same goddamn look.

191
00:18:31,778 --> 00:18:33,987
Shit.

192
00:18:36,824 --> 00:18:38,283
Sheriff's Department.

193
00:18:39,911 --> 00:18:42,662
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Slow down. Slow down.

194
00:18:49,337 --> 00:18:51,797
Been there at least a week
by the looks of things.

195
00:18:51,881 --> 00:18:54,925
I'll check to see
if there's any identification.

196
00:18:55,009 --> 00:18:57,093
Yeah.

197
00:18:57,178 --> 00:18:59,137
Do that.

198
00:19:00,932 --> 00:19:04,559
Boys, last I checked,
hunting season ended three months ago.

199
00:19:04,644 --> 00:19:06,770
We was just out taking in a little nature.

200
00:19:06,854 --> 00:19:09,356
- Fresh air is all.
- Guns away till fall.

201
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:11,733
- Aw, come on, Sheriff.
- What, are you kidding me?

202
00:19:11,818 --> 00:19:14,361
- What's with this guy?
- Well, we got us a pilot.

203
00:19:14,445 --> 00:19:16,822
Where's the plane?

204
00:19:16,906 --> 00:19:19,324
You know, last week,
Travis Quinn was going around

205
00:19:19,408 --> 00:19:22,118
saying he heard something crash
out by Hautman Bog.

206
00:19:22,203 --> 00:19:25,163
- I didn't think nothing of it.
- On account of him being full of shit?

207
00:19:25,248 --> 00:19:27,165
As a general rule.

208
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:30,710
- Well, maybe there's the exception.
- Maybe.

209
00:19:38,219 --> 00:19:40,637
You said it sounded like a plane, Trav?

210
00:19:40,721 --> 00:19:42,305
Sheriff, about the reward-

211
00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:44,641
Shit. Big plane? Little plane?
What? Come on now.

212
00:19:44,725 --> 00:19:46,643
If you can explain the difference
how those two sound,

213
00:19:46,727 --> 00:19:48,895
- I might be able to figure it out.
- You're full of shit.

214
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:50,647
He's full of shit.

215
00:19:50,731 --> 00:19:53,316
People only ask for a reward
when there's something to find.

216
00:19:53,401 --> 00:19:54,818
Is it gonna be a big reward, Sheriff?

217
00:19:54,902 --> 00:19:56,319
Travis, you ask about that again,

218
00:19:56,404 --> 00:19:58,154
I'm gonna throw you
out of the fucking boat.

219
00:19:58,239 --> 00:20:00,240
You're not gonna shoot me?

220
00:20:02,243 --> 00:20:03,493
Travis.

221
00:20:03,578 --> 00:20:05,495
Yeah?

222
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:08,206
Kill the engine.

223
00:20:11,794 --> 00:20:14,337
It was a big plane, Russ.

224
00:20:14,422 --> 00:20:16,006
Why is that?

225
00:20:16,090 --> 00:20:18,341
'Cause we're right on top of it.

226
00:20:48,581 --> 00:20:51,541
Kevin, which way does
the water flow through town?

227
00:20:51,626 --> 00:20:53,335
Nice to see you, too, Dave.

228
00:20:53,419 --> 00:20:55,086
Waste water or drinking?

229
00:20:55,171 --> 00:20:57,422
- Drinking.
- Give me a second.

230
00:20:59,216 --> 00:21:01,134
A plane that size goes down-

231
00:21:01,218 --> 00:21:03,345
nothing in the paper,
nothing in the news.

232
00:21:03,429 --> 00:21:06,264
- Make any sense to you?
- It depends on what the payload is.

233
00:21:06,349 --> 00:21:08,224
Exactly what I'm thinking.

234
00:21:08,309 --> 00:21:10,477
Which is what?

235
00:21:10,561 --> 00:21:12,896
Hautman Bog-
What's that drain into?

236
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:14,564
- Dwyer Creek.
- Which drains into?

237
00:21:14,649 --> 00:21:16,816
Black Pond. Oh, hey,
you remember monster catfish-

238
00:21:16,901 --> 00:21:20,153
Russell, where do you think
we get our drinking water from?

239
00:21:20,237 --> 00:21:23,365
Treated water comes in from the north,
breaks east-west.

240
00:21:23,449 --> 00:21:25,075
And what house does it get to first?

241
00:21:25,159 --> 00:21:27,744
Uh, let's see.

242
00:21:27,828 --> 00:21:29,746
Rory Hamill.

243
00:21:37,171 --> 00:21:41,299
You wanna shut off
the entire town's water supply on a hunch?

244
00:21:41,384 --> 00:21:44,928
Mayor, I've got three dead bodies
in the morgue in the last 48 hours.

245
00:21:45,012 --> 00:21:47,138
David, take a look around you.

246
00:21:47,223 --> 00:21:48,974
This is a farming community.

247
00:21:49,058 --> 00:21:50,976
It is springtime.
It is planting season.

248
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:52,936
You turn off the water,
you're gonna kill the crops.

249
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:56,606
You kill the crops, and you bankrupt
every family in Pierce County.

250
00:21:56,691 --> 00:21:59,734
And that is not based
on some, uh, hunch.

251
00:21:59,819 --> 00:22:01,319
That's a fact.

252
00:22:03,072 --> 00:22:05,657
Water stays on.

253
00:22:19,755 --> 00:22:20,964
Uh, Sheriff,

254
00:22:21,048 --> 00:22:22,632
I'm all for a little civil disobedience,

255
00:22:22,717 --> 00:22:26,386
but, um, I think this one
might cost you your job.

256
00:22:29,056 --> 00:22:31,057
You know what, Russ?

257
00:22:33,853 --> 00:22:36,354
That wouldn't be such a bad thing.

258
00:22:48,409 --> 00:22:50,577
What the fuck?

259
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:02,088
Shh. Hang on a second.

260
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:07,594
Well, is he dead?

261
00:23:10,222 --> 00:23:13,349
Well, if he is, he won't mind waiting.

262
00:23:17,229 --> 00:23:19,481
Oh! Jesus Christ!

263
00:23:22,234 --> 00:23:25,612
Did we or did we not request
a transfer for him this morning?

264
00:23:25,696 --> 00:23:26,696
Mm-hmm.

265
00:23:30,743 --> 00:23:32,452
God damn it.

266
00:23:37,625 --> 00:23:39,709
Even better.

267
00:23:42,463 --> 00:23:45,340
- You know what?
- What?

268
00:23:46,759 --> 00:23:48,760
We're in trouble.

269
00:24:21,085 --> 00:24:22,836
Hello?

270
00:25:17,474 --> 00:25:19,142
Jim?

271
00:25:33,073 --> 00:25:34,782
Jim?

272
00:26:23,207 --> 00:26:24,791
Jesus Christ.

273
00:26:35,719 --> 00:26:37,303
Behind you.

274
00:27:55,632 --> 00:27:57,175
Christ Almighty.

275
00:28:04,516 --> 00:28:06,434
David, I'm not gonna do this.

276
00:28:06,518 --> 00:28:08,144
I can't go to my parents.

277
00:28:08,228 --> 00:28:10,271
- You have no idea-
- And neither do you.

278
00:28:10,356 --> 00:28:13,149
Look, whatever it is,
I can't just leave.

279
00:28:13,233 --> 00:28:15,193
- Are you gonna leave?
- I'm the sheriff.

280
00:28:15,277 --> 00:28:16,652
- I'm their doctor.
- Yeah, well,

281
00:28:16,737 --> 00:28:18,488
if it turns out what they need is penicillin,

282
00:28:18,572 --> 00:28:20,656
I'll call you.

283
00:28:20,741 --> 00:28:21,824
David.

284
00:28:21,909 --> 00:28:23,409
What?

285
00:28:25,579 --> 00:28:26,579
What?

286
00:28:28,290 --> 00:28:30,750
There's somebody outside.

287
00:29:23,262 --> 00:29:26,681
David!

288
00:29:28,308 --> 00:29:30,059
Get on the ground!

289
00:29:30,144 --> 00:29:31,561
This is secure.

290
00:29:34,022 --> 00:29:36,607
All right! Let's go, men! Move it!

291
00:29:36,692 --> 00:29:38,609
Come on. Let's go.
Keep it moving.

292
00:29:41,155 --> 00:29:43,072
Sheriff, what's going on?

293
00:29:43,157 --> 00:29:45,324
- I don't know any more than you do.
- Keep moving, sir.

294
00:29:45,409 --> 00:29:46,534
Please take the first open seat.

295
00:29:46,618 --> 00:29:49,412
A funny thing happened
on the way to Cedar Rapids.

296
00:29:49,496 --> 00:29:51,873
Bastards spiked my tires.

297
00:29:51,957 --> 00:29:54,333
Who are these fuckers, man?

298
00:30:31,413 --> 00:30:33,623
Keep moving.
Everyone must exit the bus.

299
00:30:33,707 --> 00:30:34,957
Keep moving, please.

300
00:30:35,042 --> 00:30:36,876
Let's go, let's go!

301
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:39,795
Stay in line, sir.
Keep up with the group, please.

302
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:42,965
Please head into the tent.

303
00:30:43,050 --> 00:30:45,343
- There is no need for alarm.
- Inside, please.

304
00:30:45,427 --> 00:30:47,803
Forward, please.

305
00:30:47,888 --> 00:30:49,972
- Please keep moving into the tent.
- Please step forward.

306
00:30:50,057 --> 00:30:52,099
Let's go.
Keep moving, please.

307
00:30:52,184 --> 00:30:54,268
Hey, can one of you guys
tell me what's going on?

308
00:30:54,353 --> 00:30:57,480
- I'm sorry. You're gonna have to keep moving.
- Sir, come with me.

309
00:30:57,564 --> 00:30:58,606
- Let's go!
- No!

310
00:30:58,690 --> 00:31:00,149
- Russell!
- Don't touch me!

311
00:31:00,234 --> 00:31:02,235
- Coming through!
- The temperature spiked.

312
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:08,658
- Ma'am-
- What are you people doing?

313
00:31:08,742 --> 00:31:10,409
Judy- Hey, don't touch me.

314
00:31:10,494 --> 00:31:12,370
- Hey!
- Both of you, out!

315
00:31:12,454 --> 00:31:14,914
Let's go.
Keep moving, please.

316
00:31:14,998 --> 00:31:17,375
- Go ahead. This way, please.
- Judy, what does it mean?

317
00:31:17,459 --> 00:31:19,585
- They're checking for elevated temperatures.
- Clear.

318
00:31:19,670 --> 00:31:21,837
Farnum was bleeding from the nose.
So was Rory.

319
00:31:21,922 --> 00:31:23,339
Well, cerebral hemorrhaging-

320
00:31:23,423 --> 00:31:25,174
It's gotta be some kind of virus.

321
00:31:25,259 --> 00:31:27,343
- You gotta wait here.
- Look, I'm a sheriff.

322
00:31:27,427 --> 00:31:29,178
- She's a doctor. We know these people.
- Clear.

323
00:31:29,263 --> 00:31:32,181
Would you just tell us what's going on?
Maybe we can actually help you.

324
00:31:34,768 --> 00:31:36,519
- Take her in there!
- David!

325
00:31:38,105 --> 00:31:39,230
Go, go, go!

326
00:31:39,314 --> 00:31:42,525
David!
Get off me! Stop!

327
00:31:42,609 --> 00:31:46,279
David! Wait! Wait!

328
00:31:46,363 --> 00:31:48,030
Stand back! Now!

329
00:31:48,115 --> 00:31:50,032
- Wait! Wait! Wait!
- Judy! Judy!

330
00:31:50,117 --> 00:31:51,284
Wait!

331
00:31:52,452 --> 00:31:54,745
David! David!

332
00:31:54,830 --> 00:31:56,706
Judy!

333
00:31:57,791 --> 00:32:01,877
David! David! David!

334
00:32:03,797 --> 00:32:05,089
Please.

335
00:32:05,173 --> 00:32:07,008
Please help me.

336
00:32:07,092 --> 00:32:09,302
Please. Please.

337
00:32:18,145 --> 00:32:21,230
Keep it moving.
Keep it moving.

338
00:32:21,315 --> 00:32:23,441
We got Trayberg scrubbed and ready.

339
00:32:23,525 --> 00:32:25,484
Let's go, let's go.

340
00:32:28,447 --> 00:32:30,364
Please. Please.

341
00:32:30,449 --> 00:32:32,658
Don't. Please. Don't.

342
00:32:34,578 --> 00:32:37,705
No.

343
00:32:37,789 --> 00:32:39,415
No. Please.

344
00:32:39,499 --> 00:32:42,001
Please. I'm pregnant.

345
00:32:42,085 --> 00:32:43,711
Please! No!

346
00:33:10,238 --> 00:33:11,280
Let's go!

347
00:33:11,365 --> 00:33:13,699
Franklin, open these doors!

348
00:33:14,868 --> 00:33:16,744
Quickly, people.
We're getting you outta here.

349
00:33:16,828 --> 00:33:18,621
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

350
00:33:18,705 --> 00:33:20,581
- Keep moving!
- Come on!

351
00:33:26,380 --> 00:33:27,963
Let's go, let's go.

352
00:33:28,048 --> 00:33:30,549
Extend your right arm,
please, sir. Let's go.

353
00:33:30,634 --> 00:33:33,135
You'll be given a card.
It looks like this.

354
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:35,971
Do not lose it.

355
00:33:38,809 --> 00:33:40,851
Keep it moving.

356
00:33:51,613 --> 00:33:54,490
We have an inbound vehicle
coming in from the northern perimeter.

357
00:33:54,574 --> 00:33:56,784
Do you have clearance ID? Over.

358
00:33:59,663 --> 00:34:02,665
We have no ID.

359
00:34:08,922 --> 00:34:11,173
We have gunfire!

360
00:34:12,926 --> 00:34:16,011
It's a civilian vehicle!

361
00:34:18,432 --> 00:34:20,349
- Behind you!
- Right there! Right there!

362
00:34:38,285 --> 00:34:39,535
Keep moving.

363
00:34:39,619 --> 00:34:41,579
Kevin, where's Linda?

364
00:34:41,663 --> 00:34:44,373
- They took her. Judy?
- They took her, too.

365
00:34:44,458 --> 00:34:46,083
They took George and Francine

366
00:34:46,168 --> 00:34:47,543
and Winton Simon
and a whole mess of other people.

367
00:34:47,627 --> 00:34:50,254
- Jake! Jake! Jake!
- Mom!

368
00:34:50,338 --> 00:34:52,631
Let's go, people.
Keep moving. Keep moving.

369
00:34:52,716 --> 00:34:54,675
I'm going back.

370
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:56,719
They got the whole town sealed off.

371
00:34:56,803 --> 00:34:58,679
Roadblocks on every highway.

372
00:34:58,764 --> 00:35:00,431
Tim Mitchell tried to run one.

373
00:35:00,515 --> 00:35:02,266
They shot him dead.
His entire family.

374
00:35:02,350 --> 00:35:03,768
Keep it moving.
Come up ahead.

375
00:35:03,852 --> 00:35:05,978
David, this here
might be your only chance.

376
00:35:06,062 --> 00:35:09,148
Don't lose it running off
on some fool's errand.

377
00:35:09,232 --> 00:35:11,734
Judy's a fool's errand?

378
00:35:11,818 --> 00:35:13,819
You know what I'm saying.

379
00:35:15,906 --> 00:35:17,782
I'll tell you what, Kev.

380
00:35:17,866 --> 00:35:19,867
Don't ask me why I can't leave
without my wife.

381
00:35:19,951 --> 00:35:21,577
I won't ask you why you can.

382
00:35:28,418 --> 00:35:31,670
We got a breach in the yard!
Got a breach in the yard!

383
00:35:31,755 --> 00:35:34,006
Move out! Move out!
Let's go! Evacuate!

384
00:35:34,090 --> 00:35:36,300
Come on!
Let's go! Let's go!

385
00:35:36,384 --> 00:35:38,427
The crazies have breached
the containment area!

386
00:35:38,512 --> 00:35:41,430
- The military's pulling out!
- We gotta get outta here!

387
00:35:45,018 --> 00:35:46,644
Come on! Go!
Get on board!

388
00:35:46,728 --> 00:35:48,604
- We're outta here!
- Move! Move! Move!

389
00:35:48,688 --> 00:35:51,982
Take 'em out!

390
00:35:52,067 --> 00:35:55,694
On board! On board!

391
00:36:35,902 --> 00:36:37,152
Nice to see you, too, Chief.

392
00:36:37,237 --> 00:36:39,572
Oh, shit.

393
00:36:48,790 --> 00:36:50,082
How'd you get out?

394
00:36:50,166 --> 00:36:51,375
Tom Ellis ran his pickup
through the fence.

395
00:36:51,459 --> 00:36:53,335
Fucking military started shooting.

396
00:36:53,420 --> 00:36:55,004
Townsfolk going nuts.

397
00:36:55,088 --> 00:36:58,007
Before you know it,
people are just running off into the fields.

398
00:36:58,091 --> 00:37:00,342
David, Judy was still inside.

399
00:37:00,427 --> 00:37:02,511
- I'm sorry.
- She's not sick.

400
00:37:02,596 --> 00:37:05,806
She's been running a fever all month.
Russ, she's pregnant.

401
00:37:05,891 --> 00:37:07,057
It's about time.

402
00:37:07,142 --> 00:37:09,101
I'm gonna go get her.

403
00:37:09,185 --> 00:37:11,937
Hoo-fucking-yah.
Let's go to the high school.

404
00:37:34,002 --> 00:37:37,046
Becca? Becca!

405
00:37:37,130 --> 00:37:39,048
Is that you?

406
00:37:40,216 --> 00:37:42,551
Oh, God. Honey-

407
00:37:42,636 --> 00:37:45,387
Honey, are you hurt?

408
00:37:45,472 --> 00:37:47,598
Is this really happening?

409
00:37:47,682 --> 00:37:51,310
It's gonna be all right.
We're gonna be okay.

410
00:37:51,394 --> 00:37:54,605
You don't really believe that, do you?

411
00:38:11,706 --> 00:38:14,166
Shh.

412
00:40:09,824 --> 00:40:11,241
Oh. Shh. Shh.

413
00:40:11,326 --> 00:40:14,578
Please, Principal Sandborn, please stop.

414
00:40:14,662 --> 00:40:16,538
Please, let me go.

415
00:40:16,623 --> 00:40:19,333
Please don't do this.

416
00:40:19,417 --> 00:40:20,959
No. Please don't do this.

417
00:40:21,044 --> 00:40:24,296
Please. No, no. Please.

418
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:26,632
No!

419
00:40:36,643 --> 00:40:38,018
Oh, shit.

420
00:40:45,193 --> 00:40:47,194
What are you doing? Stop!

421
00:40:47,278 --> 00:40:49,238
No. Please. Please.

422
00:40:49,322 --> 00:40:52,241
- No! N-
- Just get out of here, please.

423
00:40:52,325 --> 00:40:55,410
Stop. Please go. Don't.

424
00:40:55,495 --> 00:40:57,830
- Don't hurt her. Please, just go away.
- Please.

425
00:40:57,914 --> 00:40:59,248
Please.

426
00:40:59,332 --> 00:41:02,251
Please stop. Please stop.

427
00:41:02,335 --> 00:41:04,920
Stop. Leave her alone.

428
00:41:05,004 --> 00:41:06,630
Stop.

429
00:41:06,714 --> 00:41:09,633
Please just get out of here. Please.

430
00:41:09,717 --> 00:41:12,636
No.

431
00:41:14,264 --> 00:41:15,180
No!

432
00:41:16,599 --> 00:41:19,393
Oh! Oh!

433
00:41:19,477 --> 00:41:22,729
Oh, God! Oh, David!

434
00:41:22,814 --> 00:41:25,482
David! Oh, God!

435
00:41:25,567 --> 00:41:27,526
Are you okay?

436
00:41:27,610 --> 00:41:30,362
No, not really.

437
00:41:32,031 --> 00:41:35,784
- Uh, Chief?
- We gotta get to Quik Phil's truck stop on 35.

438
00:41:35,869 --> 00:41:38,996
They're putting people on buses,
and they're getting them out of here.

439
00:41:40,165 --> 00:41:43,250
We're gonna go. Come on.

440
00:41:45,211 --> 00:41:48,338
- Did Peter call?
- Shh.

441
00:41:50,049 --> 00:41:53,010
- Did Peter call?
- That's gonna be me.

442
00:41:53,094 --> 00:41:56,180
Russell, we've got enough problems
without you inventing them.

443
00:41:56,264 --> 00:41:57,973
- That's easy for you to say.
- Did Peter call?

444
00:41:58,057 --> 00:41:59,600
You're at the end of the pot mine.

445
00:41:59,684 --> 00:42:01,268
I'm a half mile from the farm.

446
00:42:01,352 --> 00:42:02,352
- Who's the sheriff?
- What?

447
00:42:02,437 --> 00:42:04,354
Who's the sheriff of Pierce County?

448
00:42:04,439 --> 00:42:06,607
- You are.
- I am. Who's the deputy?

449
00:42:06,691 --> 00:42:07,983
- That would be me.
- You are.

450
00:42:08,067 --> 00:42:09,484
Deputy does what the sheriff tells him.

451
00:42:09,569 --> 00:42:12,863
That's the balance of power.
And I'm telling you,

452
00:42:12,947 --> 00:42:15,782
you're not getting sick,
you understand me?

453
00:42:16,951 --> 00:42:19,161
Did Peter call?

454
00:42:21,122 --> 00:42:23,248
Did Peter call?

455
00:42:24,250 --> 00:42:26,126
I hope you're right, Chief.

456
00:42:26,211 --> 00:42:29,588
I'm not world leader, but I had plans.

457
00:42:29,672 --> 00:42:31,131
Did Peter call?

458
00:42:31,216 --> 00:42:32,799
Come on.

459
00:42:46,272 --> 00:42:48,440
Let's go.

460
00:43:16,344 --> 00:43:18,345
I'll check the truck.

461
00:43:20,431 --> 00:43:21,765
Fuck.

462
00:43:23,726 --> 00:43:26,645
Aw, shit!
It's booted.

463
00:43:30,149 --> 00:43:32,150
- They all are.
- I'll check those cars.

464
00:43:41,577 --> 00:43:44,454
It's not booted.

465
00:43:48,501 --> 00:43:50,377
Whoa, whoa.

466
00:43:51,379 --> 00:43:53,422
Russell,

467
00:43:53,506 --> 00:43:55,007
get out of the truck.

468
00:43:55,091 --> 00:43:57,509
Just give me a second.

469
00:43:57,593 --> 00:43:59,094
Oh, Jesus.

470
00:43:59,178 --> 00:44:01,930
Go. Run. Go on.

471
00:44:02,015 --> 00:44:03,974
Go, go, go, go,
go, go, go, go.

472
00:44:04,058 --> 00:44:05,600
Get down, get down, get down.

473
00:44:11,065 --> 00:44:13,275
Come on, boys.

474
00:44:13,359 --> 00:44:15,027
Come on! Get him!

475
00:44:17,030 --> 00:44:19,323
Come on! Yeah!

476
00:44:19,407 --> 00:44:20,949
Whoo!

477
00:44:21,034 --> 00:44:22,409
Oh, yeah!

478
00:44:24,078 --> 00:44:25,954
- Whoo!
- Run, little man!

479
00:44:26,039 --> 00:44:27,748
Run!

480
00:44:27,832 --> 00:44:29,624
- Get him!
- Whoo!

481
00:44:31,878 --> 00:44:34,212
- Nice shot. Nice shot.
- Oh, yeah!

482
00:44:34,297 --> 00:44:35,964
Huh? Nice shot.

483
00:44:36,049 --> 00:44:38,550
- Oh, yeah! Oh, yeah!
- Nice shot, huh?

484
00:44:38,634 --> 00:44:40,385
Whoo!

485
00:44:43,973 --> 00:44:46,183
Come on. Get him.

486
00:44:46,267 --> 00:44:49,144
Hey, straight through the heart!

487
00:44:49,228 --> 00:44:51,521
- Uh-huh!
- Yeah!

488
00:44:51,606 --> 00:44:53,148
Shit.

489
00:44:53,232 --> 00:44:54,358
- Come on.
- Huh?

490
00:44:54,442 --> 00:44:56,360
Hey, he's gonna dress up real nice.

491
00:44:56,444 --> 00:44:59,571
Come on, boy.

492
00:45:01,991 --> 00:45:03,992
Come on.
Get him up on there.

493
00:45:18,716 --> 00:45:20,342
Good shot, man.

494
00:45:20,426 --> 00:45:22,928
I knew I was okay about that shot.

495
00:45:43,616 --> 00:45:46,368
It's a hell of a walk to Quik Phil's.

496
00:45:48,037 --> 00:45:49,955
I got the old cruiser on blocks.

497
00:45:50,039 --> 00:45:52,040
That piece of shit still works?

498
00:45:52,125 --> 00:45:53,542
Yeah.

499
00:45:53,626 --> 00:45:56,086
I guess you can't boot a car without wheels.

500
00:45:56,170 --> 00:45:58,046
It's seven miles to my place.

501
00:45:58,131 --> 00:45:59,881
It's five if we cut through
the McGregor farm.

502
00:45:59,966 --> 00:46:02,426
Another 20 to Quik Phil's from there.

503
00:46:03,469 --> 00:46:05,262
- I'm fine.
- Good.

504
00:46:05,346 --> 00:46:06,346
Let's go.

505
00:46:13,438 --> 00:46:15,480
They took my blood.

506
00:46:18,651 --> 00:46:21,820
Ran at least one test that I saw.

507
00:46:23,823 --> 00:46:26,575
What if the reason they didn't let me go
is because I have it?

508
00:46:26,659 --> 00:46:29,578
You're pregnant.
That's why you have a fever.

509
00:46:29,662 --> 00:46:33,248
David, you can't know that for sure.

510
00:46:33,332 --> 00:46:36,084
I can, and I do.

511
00:46:37,503 --> 00:46:40,547
If you're sick, I'm sick.
We drank from the same tap.

512
00:46:40,631 --> 00:46:43,633
And I'm not sick.
None of us are.

513
00:46:48,431 --> 00:46:50,348
We are gonna get through this.

514
00:46:57,190 --> 00:46:58,815
What the fuck?

515
00:46:58,900 --> 00:47:01,651
Scotty McGregor.
It's her boyfriend.

516
00:47:01,736 --> 00:47:02,944
Russell, stop her.

517
00:47:03,029 --> 00:47:03,945
- Yeah, I got it.
- David-

518
00:47:04,030 --> 00:47:06,239
We don't have time for this.

519
00:47:06,324 --> 00:47:08,366
You had time for me.

520
00:47:14,248 --> 00:47:16,208
Okay, let's go.

521
00:47:19,462 --> 00:47:22,130
It looks deserted.

522
00:47:22,215 --> 00:47:23,548
Scotty?

523
00:47:26,636 --> 00:47:28,053
- Scotty?
- Get back!

524
00:47:28,137 --> 00:47:30,722
- Drop the fucking gun, Scotty.
- I will blow your head off.

525
00:47:30,806 --> 00:47:33,141
- Scotty, it's me.
- Stay here.

526
00:47:33,226 --> 00:47:37,187
Scotty, don't be an asshole.
We're fine.

527
00:47:39,815 --> 00:47:41,149
Scotty.

528
00:47:41,234 --> 00:47:43,151
Scotty, put the gun down.

529
00:47:43,236 --> 00:47:44,653
Put it down.

530
00:47:44,737 --> 00:47:46,404
Scotty.

531
00:47:56,916 --> 00:47:58,500
Sorry.

532
00:48:00,253 --> 00:48:02,254
Had to be sure.

533
00:48:02,338 --> 00:48:06,466
Yeah, well, that's
a two-way street there, Scotty.

534
00:48:09,095 --> 00:48:12,180
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

535
00:48:12,265 --> 00:48:13,974
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

536
00:48:14,058 --> 00:48:16,059
- Scotty, where's your mom?
- Back at the house.

537
00:48:16,143 --> 00:48:18,103
We were just getting some supplies
before we started walking.

538
00:48:18,187 --> 00:48:20,689
The sheriff's got a car.
You two can come with us.

539
00:48:20,773 --> 00:48:23,441
- Are you okay?
- Better than you guys.

540
00:48:23,526 --> 00:48:26,319
- How's your mom?
- Be quiet.

541
00:48:26,404 --> 00:48:29,155
- Get in the barn.
- Go, go, go, go, go.

542
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:02,981
Russ.

543
00:49:11,324 --> 00:49:13,867
- We have one civilian coming out.
- What are you doing?

544
00:49:13,951 --> 00:49:16,244
- Ma'am, please.
- Stop! Stop!

545
00:49:16,329 --> 00:49:17,621
We need you downstairs.

546
00:49:17,705 --> 00:49:19,372
- Everything's gonna be okay.
- Wait.

547
00:49:19,457 --> 00:49:22,042
- We just need to process you.
- Oh, no.

548
00:49:22,126 --> 00:49:23,835
- Please!
- Okay, I got an adult male.

549
00:49:23,919 --> 00:49:25,712
I just need you...

550
00:49:25,796 --> 00:49:27,339
It'll just take a second, ma'am.

551
00:49:27,423 --> 00:49:29,132
Too late.

552
00:49:32,303 --> 00:49:34,095
Hold it right there!

553
00:49:39,226 --> 00:49:41,853
Scotty!

554
00:49:46,359 --> 00:49:48,234
Okay, light them up.

555
00:49:58,537 --> 00:50:00,789
Okay, let's go! Split it up!

556
00:50:00,873 --> 00:50:03,124
I want a complete sweep of the area!

557
00:50:03,209 --> 00:50:04,959
Take my gun.
Close the back of the barn.

558
00:50:05,044 --> 00:50:08,088
Move, move, move!

559
00:50:37,076 --> 00:50:39,077
Don't kill me, please.
Don't kill me.

560
00:50:39,161 --> 00:50:40,161
Oh, fuck.

561
00:50:40,246 --> 00:50:43,415
How could you do it?
How could you...

562
00:50:43,499 --> 00:50:45,417
- Becca-
- You make a sound louder than this,

563
00:50:45,501 --> 00:50:47,168
and I'll kill you, you understand?

564
00:50:47,253 --> 00:50:49,003
- What the hell was that?
- Orders, sir.

565
00:50:49,088 --> 00:50:50,839
- Who, asshole?
- Whoever gives them- I don't know.

566
00:50:50,923 --> 00:50:52,674
- Bullshit!
- What the fuck is going on here?

567
00:50:52,758 --> 00:50:55,093
All's they said is that there'd been
some sort of accident.

568
00:50:55,177 --> 00:50:57,846
My whole unit got flown in.
We didn't even know what state we was in

569
00:50:57,930 --> 00:51:01,099
till we seen the license plates.

570
00:51:05,938 --> 00:51:09,733
Am I gonna die without my mask on?

571
00:51:09,817 --> 00:51:11,943
Is that what they told you-

572
00:51:12,027 --> 00:51:13,945
If you took your mask off,
you were gonna die?

573
00:51:14,029 --> 00:51:17,198
They just said to keep it on.

574
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:20,118
Look, um,

575
00:51:20,202 --> 00:51:22,871
I know I don't deserve
any favors from you people,

576
00:51:22,955 --> 00:51:25,957
but if you let me go,
I swear to God I won't say nothing.

577
00:51:26,041 --> 00:51:28,793
I didn't sign up
to shoot unarmed civilians.

578
00:51:30,212 --> 00:51:32,213
- I'll just leave, okay?
- Sit down.

579
00:51:32,298 --> 00:51:34,090
- Put the gun down, Russ.
- Chief...

580
00:51:36,385 --> 00:51:38,720
I'm a sheriff.
That's my deputy.

581
00:51:38,804 --> 00:51:41,514
Look, my wife's a doctor.
She's pregnant.

582
00:51:41,599 --> 00:51:43,933
- Becca here is not even 18.
- When he blabs, they'll find us.

583
00:51:44,018 --> 00:51:46,102
If we don't let him go,
they'll find us for sure.

584
00:51:46,187 --> 00:51:49,314
And besides,
he's not gonna blab.

585
00:51:50,566 --> 00:51:52,192
No, sir.

586
00:52:01,911 --> 00:52:03,912
You gotta give it to him, Russ.

587
00:52:03,996 --> 00:52:04,996
Shit.

588
00:52:05,080 --> 00:52:07,749
I'm sorry about your folks' town.

589
00:52:07,833 --> 00:52:10,210
- Hey, one up!
- Don't shoot! Don't shoot!

590
00:52:10,294 --> 00:52:12,170
Any crazies back there, Babcock?

591
00:52:15,341 --> 00:52:16,883
Babcock?

592
00:52:17,927 --> 00:52:19,594
No. We're all clear.

593
00:52:19,678 --> 00:52:21,971
Good. Military's pulling
back to the perimeter.

594
00:52:22,056 --> 00:52:24,015
Let's go. Come on.

595
00:52:26,268 --> 00:52:28,186
Barn's clear!

596
00:52:28,270 --> 00:52:30,438
- We're secure back there!
- All right, then.

597
00:52:30,523 --> 00:52:32,982
Mount up!
We're moving out!

598
00:52:52,127 --> 00:52:55,171
If what that soldier said is true,

599
00:52:55,256 --> 00:52:57,757
this disease has gone airborne.

600
00:53:00,886 --> 00:53:03,638
We just have to keep going.

601
00:54:02,615 --> 00:54:04,991
Uh, we'll go and get
the car up and running.

602
00:54:05,075 --> 00:54:07,285
- Come on.
- Go.

603
00:54:10,664 --> 00:54:13,207
Hey.

604
00:54:13,292 --> 00:54:15,001
Hey, hey, hey.

605
00:54:24,345 --> 00:54:26,346
It's perfect.

606
00:54:28,265 --> 00:54:31,434
It's a perfect, beautiful morning,

607
00:54:31,518 --> 00:54:33,436
and this is our home.

608
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:35,438
This is where we were
gonna raise our baby.

609
00:54:35,522 --> 00:54:37,690
We can still do all those things.

610
00:54:37,775 --> 00:54:39,108
Hmm?

611
00:54:40,527 --> 00:54:43,029
Everyone we know...

612
00:54:43,113 --> 00:54:44,948
is dead.

613
00:54:47,534 --> 00:54:51,996
This town is dead,
and it's not coming back.

614
00:54:53,582 --> 00:54:56,000
It's never coming back.

615
00:55:03,717 --> 00:55:04,968
Fuck, yeah.

616
00:55:05,052 --> 00:55:07,261
See if you can find a toolbox.

617
00:55:07,346 --> 00:55:08,846
Okay.

618
00:55:41,588 --> 00:55:44,132
This was gonna be your room.

619
00:56:32,264 --> 00:56:34,140
Judy.

620
00:56:37,936 --> 00:56:39,187
Look, I know this is hard,

621
00:56:39,271 --> 00:56:42,065
but we've gotta keep moving.

622
00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:15,431
This is the gun that killed your father.

623
00:57:23,190 --> 00:57:25,650
Baby.

624
00:57:25,734 --> 00:57:28,486
Peggy- Peggy, no. Not Judy.

625
00:57:29,988 --> 00:57:31,572
No. No, no, no.

626
00:57:31,657 --> 00:57:33,741
I shot him.
I did. I shot him.

627
00:57:33,826 --> 00:57:35,409
Yes.

628
00:57:35,494 --> 00:57:37,245
Peggy, I shot him.

629
00:57:37,329 --> 00:57:39,288
Look at me, you crazy bitch!

630
00:57:39,373 --> 00:57:42,500
That's it.
I fucking shot him!

631
00:57:42,584 --> 00:57:44,418
I did it!

632
00:57:44,503 --> 00:57:46,838
He walked on that field
with a loaded shotgun!

633
00:57:46,922 --> 00:57:49,173
And I'm glad I did!

634
00:57:49,258 --> 00:57:51,050
They should give me a fucking medal!

635
00:57:51,135 --> 00:57:53,302
I finally killed the town drunk!

636
00:58:26,628 --> 00:58:27,712
Oh!

637
00:58:44,646 --> 00:58:46,689
- Oh, God.
- We're okay.

638
00:58:46,773 --> 00:58:48,858
- Baby!
- Oh, my God.

639
00:58:50,235 --> 00:58:52,153
Let me see your hand.

640
00:58:52,237 --> 00:58:54,530
Give me the Betadine.

641
00:58:57,826 --> 00:58:59,869
Yep, that's it. Here.

642
00:58:59,953 --> 00:59:01,037
Shit.

643
00:59:14,551 --> 00:59:17,345
Russell. Russell!

644
00:59:17,429 --> 00:59:19,347
Just making sure.

645
00:59:35,489 --> 00:59:37,490
He's sick, David.

646
00:59:39,451 --> 00:59:41,369
You don't know that.

647
00:59:41,453 --> 00:59:42,620
- You saw what he did.
- Hey, guys.

648
00:59:42,704 --> 00:59:45,122
Come on. We gotta go.

649
00:59:48,085 --> 00:59:50,002
He saved our lives.

650
00:59:50,087 --> 00:59:52,088
That's what I saw.

651
01:00:39,511 --> 01:00:41,137
Hey, you feeling okay?

652
01:00:41,221 --> 01:00:43,556
- She's fine.
- Well, I'm just saying, if she's getting sick,

653
01:00:43,640 --> 01:00:46,225
- we don't wanna be in the fucking car with her.
- Russell, she's fine.

654
01:00:46,310 --> 01:00:47,768
I'm not sick.

655
01:00:47,853 --> 01:00:50,771
You wouldn't know,
'cause that'd be the sickness

656
01:00:50,856 --> 01:00:53,024
- messing with your mind.
- Okay. Russell, that's enough.

657
01:00:53,108 --> 01:00:55,776
Don't lose your head.

658
01:00:55,861 --> 01:00:58,279
What do you mean by that?

659
01:00:58,363 --> 01:01:00,364
I mean, don't lose your head.

660
01:01:00,449 --> 01:01:01,991
What do you mean by that, Chief?

661
01:01:02,075 --> 01:01:03,868
I mean...

662
01:01:03,952 --> 01:01:05,828
She's fine.

663
01:01:07,539 --> 01:01:08,873
Now, just...

664
01:01:12,085 --> 01:01:14,086
Fuck!

665
01:01:15,547 --> 01:01:18,466
- Did he see us?
- I don't know.

666
01:01:18,550 --> 01:01:22,303
- David, honey...
- Aw, shit.

667
01:01:22,387 --> 01:01:24,096
Guys, it's turning around.

668
01:01:24,181 --> 01:01:25,306
- It's coming back for us!
- Shit! Let's go!

669
01:01:25,390 --> 01:01:28,392
We gotta get out of here!

670
01:01:28,477 --> 01:01:31,270
- Go! Chief, let's go!
- The helicopter's coming!

671
01:01:54,086 --> 01:01:55,920
- We can't stay on the highway.
- No.

672
01:01:56,004 --> 01:01:57,588
There's gotta be another road we can take.

673
01:01:57,672 --> 01:02:00,216
- What road? Tell me?
- I don't know. There's gotta be something.

674
01:02:00,300 --> 01:02:02,176
- What road can they not see? Tell me.
- What?

675
01:02:02,260 --> 01:02:04,178
What road can they not see?

676
01:02:04,262 --> 01:02:05,846
What magic road can they not see?

677
01:02:05,931 --> 01:02:08,224
Tell me, and I'll fucking go.

678
01:02:08,308 --> 01:02:11,435
David, I'm just trying to help.

679
01:02:13,855 --> 01:02:16,565
I'm sorry.

680
01:02:18,276 --> 01:02:20,736
- I saw someone.
- Move. Where?

681
01:02:20,821 --> 01:02:23,697
He was back there.
I know I saw someone.

682
01:02:23,782 --> 01:02:25,699
Uh...

683
01:02:25,784 --> 01:02:29,120
- Oh, fuck.
- Shit.

684
01:02:30,664 --> 01:02:32,081
What the fuck?

685
01:02:33,917 --> 01:02:35,251
David, get us outta here.

686
01:02:36,962 --> 01:02:40,256
Oh, shit.

687
01:02:40,340 --> 01:02:42,883
Start the car.

688
01:02:42,968 --> 01:02:44,051
Come on, Chief.

689
01:02:45,637 --> 01:02:47,388
Let's go. Come on.
Get us outta here.

690
01:02:51,643 --> 01:02:52,726
Let's go! Let's go!

691
01:02:54,187 --> 01:02:55,980
Come on!

692
01:03:03,071 --> 01:03:04,655
Come on!

693
01:03:04,739 --> 01:03:06,407
- Let's go!
- All right!

694
01:03:06,491 --> 01:03:08,576
Come on!

695
01:03:08,660 --> 01:03:10,995
Come on! Let's go!

696
01:03:11,079 --> 01:03:13,080
- Why aren't we moving?
- Why the fuck aren't we moving, Chief?

697
01:03:13,165 --> 01:03:15,833
- 'Cause I can't get any fucking traction.
- Go! Go!

698
01:03:15,917 --> 01:03:18,085
Fuck! Let's go!
Get us outta here! Come on!

699
01:03:20,338 --> 01:03:22,089
I don't wanna die like this!

700
01:03:22,174 --> 01:03:24,049
What the fuck was that?

701
01:03:27,512 --> 01:03:29,972
- There! There! Right there!
- Motherfucker!

702
01:03:30,056 --> 01:03:31,140
- Russell- Russ-
- There!

703
01:03:31,224 --> 01:03:32,141
Oh, shit!

704
01:03:32,225 --> 01:03:33,142
Motherfucker!

705
01:03:35,228 --> 01:03:36,562
Russell!

706
01:03:36,646 --> 01:03:39,064
- Oh, fuck!
- Russell!

707
01:03:39,149 --> 01:03:40,441
I saw movement!

708
01:03:40,525 --> 01:03:43,110
Everything is fucking moving!

709
01:04:22,817 --> 01:04:24,818
Go! Come on! Come on!

710
01:04:35,497 --> 01:04:37,831
- Stop the fucking car!
- Stop! Stop! Stop!

711
01:04:37,916 --> 01:04:39,750
Stop the car!

712
01:04:39,834 --> 01:04:41,418
- Stop!
- Judy!

713
01:04:42,921 --> 01:04:45,881
Shit! David!

714
01:04:45,966 --> 01:04:48,384
Help me here!
Help me!

715
01:04:48,468 --> 01:04:52,054
Oh, God, please.
You're okay.

716
01:04:52,138 --> 01:04:56,100
Becca! Becca! Becca!

717
01:05:04,776 --> 01:05:06,277
Oh, no.

718
01:05:12,200 --> 01:05:13,784
Becca.

719
01:05:19,666 --> 01:05:21,292
No.

720
01:05:22,627 --> 01:05:23,961
Becca.

721
01:06:21,561 --> 01:06:23,604
That's my truck.

722
01:06:23,688 --> 01:06:26,023
Fuckers spiked my tires.

723
01:06:38,078 --> 01:06:39,912
Shit.

724
01:06:51,383 --> 01:06:53,008
God damn it!

725
01:06:53,093 --> 01:06:55,803
We need water.

726
01:06:55,887 --> 01:06:57,304
I know.

727
01:06:57,389 --> 01:07:00,391
Guys, car coming!

728
01:07:10,235 --> 01:07:12,069
Stay here.

729
01:07:12,153 --> 01:07:14,029
David, what are you doing?

730
01:07:14,114 --> 01:07:16,365
We're taking this car.

731
01:07:30,171 --> 01:07:32,506
- Motherfucker!
- Russ!

732
01:07:32,590 --> 01:07:34,383
What are you- No!

733
01:07:35,468 --> 01:07:37,136
Whoo!

734
01:08:00,368 --> 01:08:04,037
Welcome to Pierce County,
friendliest place on earth, asshole.

735
01:08:04,122 --> 01:08:06,081
Russ, I wanna talk to him.

736
01:08:07,709 --> 01:08:09,585
Okay.

737
01:08:09,669 --> 01:08:11,879
Who the fuck do you think you are?

738
01:08:11,963 --> 01:08:15,215
I'm the guy standing between you and a bullet.

739
01:08:15,300 --> 01:08:18,177
Now, what was on that plane?

740
01:08:18,261 --> 01:08:21,180
What was on that goddamn plane?

741
01:08:21,264 --> 01:08:22,681
Trixie.

742
01:08:22,766 --> 01:08:25,100
Rhabdoveridae prototype.

743
01:08:25,185 --> 01:08:27,227
A- A fucking biological weapon.
- It was headed

744
01:08:27,312 --> 01:08:30,063
- to an incinerator in Texas.
- Whoa. What is this?

745
01:08:30,148 --> 01:08:32,733
You're telling me that you guys
engineered this crap?

746
01:08:32,817 --> 01:08:35,402
It's designed to destabilize a population.

747
01:08:35,487 --> 01:08:37,571
In this case, the wrong one.

748
01:08:37,655 --> 01:08:39,198
Look, fella, we lost a plane.

749
01:08:39,282 --> 01:08:41,408
What do you want me to say?

750
01:08:44,162 --> 01:08:46,872
How about, "Sorry for destroying
your whole goddamn town"?

751
01:08:46,998 --> 01:08:49,416
- What would you have preferred, a global pandemic?
- Wait. Wait.

752
01:08:49,501 --> 01:08:52,211
Take it up with the pilot.
I came here to help.

753
01:08:52,295 --> 01:08:54,129
Help who? Help us?

754
01:08:54,214 --> 01:08:56,256
What- What is the incubation period?

755
01:08:56,341 --> 01:08:58,258
48 hours.

756
01:08:58,343 --> 01:09:00,761
After that, you're either dead
or you don't have it.

757
01:09:00,845 --> 01:09:03,972
Fine. It's day three,
and we're still talking.

758
01:09:04,057 --> 01:09:05,808
So you are gonna help us.

759
01:09:08,436 --> 01:09:09,853
What the fuck!

760
01:09:09,938 --> 01:09:11,522
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no!
- Oh, my God!

761
01:09:11,606 --> 01:09:13,482
What the fuck is the matter with you?

762
01:09:13,566 --> 01:09:15,651
I said that I wanted to talk to him!

763
01:09:17,195 --> 01:09:18,487
You talked.

764
01:09:48,017 --> 01:09:49,017
Shit.

765
01:09:54,399 --> 01:09:56,441
I'm gonna need that back.

766
01:09:56,526 --> 01:09:57,943
I'll carry it for a while.

767
01:09:58,027 --> 01:10:00,571
- You've been carrying it the whole time.
- Oh, no. Really.

768
01:10:00,655 --> 01:10:02,281
I got it.

769
01:10:02,365 --> 01:10:04,700
You sure?

770
01:10:04,784 --> 01:10:06,118
Yeah.

771
01:10:19,507 --> 01:10:21,508
Russell, we're on your side.

772
01:10:21,593 --> 01:10:23,886
My side? Shit.
I didn't even know there were sides.

773
01:10:23,970 --> 01:10:26,013
- There's not. I'm just-
- Shut up the fuck up!

774
01:10:26,097 --> 01:10:28,265
- Tell her to shut up, or I'll kill her, too.
- Russell, no!

775
01:10:28,349 --> 01:10:30,559
- Judy, stop talking.
- Okay.

776
01:10:30,643 --> 01:10:32,561
Let him think about what he's doing.

777
01:10:32,645 --> 01:10:34,438
Uh-huh.

778
01:10:36,524 --> 01:10:40,444
One, two,

779
01:10:40,528 --> 01:10:42,321
three.

780
01:10:44,574 --> 01:10:47,576
That's how many times
I've saved your life.

781
01:10:49,454 --> 01:10:50,746
Go on.

782
01:10:50,830 --> 01:10:52,748
Walk out where I can see you.

783
01:10:52,832 --> 01:10:53,832
Move!

784
01:11:19,525 --> 01:11:20,901
Fucking heavy.

785
01:11:27,367 --> 01:11:30,786
Move!

786
01:11:40,505 --> 01:11:43,715
- Fuck it. I'm gonna confront him.
- No, David. Don't. Please.

787
01:11:43,800 --> 01:11:47,469
If we don't make it to that truck stop,
we're dead anyway.

788
01:11:47,553 --> 01:11:50,013
- Don't, David. Don't.
- Back off!

789
01:11:50,098 --> 01:11:52,599
- I wanna talk to you.
- I will fucking shoot you where you stand.

790
01:11:52,684 --> 01:11:54,518
- I just wanna talk.
- David, stop.

791
01:11:54,602 --> 01:11:56,269
You better listen to me.

792
01:11:56,354 --> 01:11:57,771
- David.
- Put the gun down.

793
01:11:57,855 --> 01:12:00,565
- Final warning, Chief.
- Put it down.

794
01:12:00,650 --> 01:12:03,652
Please? Just put it down.

795
01:12:03,736 --> 01:12:06,113
I just wanna talk.

796
01:12:06,197 --> 01:12:09,783
You and me, man to man.

797
01:12:09,867 --> 01:12:11,535
Come on.

798
01:12:12,912 --> 01:12:14,746
- Shit.
- Okay.

799
01:12:14,831 --> 01:12:16,540
Here's the deal.

800
01:12:17,667 --> 01:12:19,710
Fuck!

801
01:12:32,765 --> 01:12:34,099
Hey.

802
01:12:35,727 --> 01:12:38,729
You remember that monster catfish
I caught last summer?

803
01:12:38,813 --> 01:12:40,772
What'd he weigh, you reckon?

804
01:12:43,276 --> 01:12:46,486
35, 40 pounds.

805
01:12:46,571 --> 01:12:48,155
Shit.

806
01:12:48,239 --> 01:12:51,241
It was a big son of a bitch.

807
01:13:02,879 --> 01:13:04,838
I'm not right, am I?

808
01:13:17,101 --> 01:13:18,769
Can I walk with you guys?

809
01:13:20,772 --> 01:13:23,398
Just a little while longer?

810
01:13:25,318 --> 01:13:27,277
Please?

811
01:14:00,645 --> 01:14:02,854
Shit.

812
01:14:02,980 --> 01:14:06,399
If you cut through there,
you can make it to the highway on the other side.

813
01:14:06,484 --> 01:14:09,486
- They'll see us.
- Nah, they'll be focusing on me.

814
01:14:10,655 --> 01:14:13,573
Deputy does what
the sheriff tells him, right?

815
01:14:13,658 --> 01:14:15,158
You're the sheriff.

816
01:14:16,661 --> 01:14:18,745
Come on, Chief.

817
01:14:18,830 --> 01:14:20,413
I'm done.

818
01:14:20,498 --> 01:14:22,874
I'm gonna die here no matter what.

819
01:14:22,959 --> 01:14:25,293
So let it mean something.

820
01:14:25,378 --> 01:14:29,089
Let it mean that you two made it.
Give me that.

821
01:14:49,861 --> 01:14:51,778
Hoo-fucking-yah.

822
01:14:53,781 --> 01:14:55,991
We got an inbound!

823
01:14:56,075 --> 01:14:57,951
- Hey!
- Attention!

824
01:14:58,035 --> 01:15:01,121
- You have entered a military operation.
- Hey! Hey!

825
01:15:01,205 --> 01:15:03,081
Please identify yourself.

826
01:15:03,166 --> 01:15:04,791
My name's Deputy Russell Crank,

827
01:15:04,876 --> 01:15:06,793
the Pierce County Sheriff's Department.

828
01:15:06,878 --> 01:15:09,629
- Keep your hands in the air and walk slowly.
- It's okay. I'm not sick.

829
01:15:09,714 --> 01:15:11,047
Make no sudden movements

830
01:15:11,132 --> 01:15:12,799
- or you will be fired upon.
- Oh, shit.

831
01:15:12,884 --> 01:15:15,177
We are a live-fire operation.

832
01:15:15,261 --> 01:15:17,012
Get out from behind the vehicle.

833
01:15:17,096 --> 01:15:20,223
You are in breach of
a Level 4 military operation.

834
01:15:26,689 --> 01:15:30,025
Reveal yourself,
or we will open fire.

835
01:15:32,612 --> 01:15:35,488
- Proceed slowly with your hands in the air.
- It's okay.

836
01:15:35,573 --> 01:15:37,199
It's okay.

837
01:15:37,283 --> 01:15:39,993
Now stop there
and get down on the ground.

838
01:15:40,077 --> 01:15:42,996
Stop and get down on the ground!

839
01:15:43,080 --> 01:15:45,415
Get down on the ground now!

840
01:15:49,003 --> 01:15:52,297
- He's down!
- Man down! Cease fire!

841
01:15:52,381 --> 01:15:54,466
Fireteam Bravo, move up.

842
01:15:54,550 --> 01:15:56,343
Alpha Team, stand by!

843
01:15:56,427 --> 01:15:58,261
Let's go, let's go!

844
01:16:00,973 --> 01:16:02,265
Approach with caution.

845
01:16:02,350 --> 01:16:04,684
Movement in tight.
He's still breathing!

846
01:16:04,769 --> 01:16:07,354
Secure that weapon!

847
01:16:07,438 --> 01:16:10,273
Stay on him.

848
01:16:12,026 --> 01:16:15,070
Fuck you for what you did.

849
01:16:27,166 --> 01:16:31,253
Hey! Get an 18-Wheeler Dog

850
01:16:31,337 --> 01:16:33,588
only at Quik Phil's.

851
01:16:33,673 --> 01:16:36,758
Football fans,
show your support this off-season

852
01:16:36,842 --> 01:16:40,262
with our University of Iowa
Hawkeyes Snack Pack.

853
01:16:40,346 --> 01:16:43,431
One jar of hot sauce and one jar of salsa

854
01:16:43,516 --> 01:16:45,725
in a collectible Iowa Hawkeyes helmet.

855
01:16:45,810 --> 01:16:48,395
Available while supplies last

856
01:16:48,479 --> 01:16:51,564
only at Quik Phil's.

857
01:16:51,649 --> 01:16:53,900
It was Grand Central last night.

858
01:16:53,985 --> 01:16:58,196
Nothing satisfies hunger
better than a Quik Phil's Mega-burger.

859
01:16:58,281 --> 01:17:00,198
Take it to go or eat it here

860
01:17:00,283 --> 01:17:03,785
- in one of our panoramic dining areas.
- Wait here.

861
01:17:16,340 --> 01:17:18,258
Hello?

862
01:18:13,981 --> 01:18:16,191
Judy?

863
01:18:16,275 --> 01:18:20,236
Judy! Judy!

864
01:18:25,076 --> 01:18:27,702
Judy, you all right?

865
01:18:46,305 --> 01:18:48,431
Ohh.

866
01:19:02,947 --> 01:19:06,074
They exterminated everyone,
not just the sick.

867
01:19:06,158 --> 01:19:08,535
- Look, there's a rig we can take.
- What's the point?

868
01:19:08,619 --> 01:19:11,121
- If we get out of here, they're gonna kill us, too.
- No.

869
01:19:11,205 --> 01:19:13,498
- If we get to Cedar Rapids-
- David, can you just stop it?

870
01:19:13,582 --> 01:19:16,292
- If we get to Cedar Rapids-
- Can you stop pretending

871
01:19:16,377 --> 01:19:18,628
everything is gonna be okay?

872
01:19:18,712 --> 01:19:20,296
All right.

873
01:19:21,382 --> 01:19:23,174
For Christ sakes.

874
01:19:29,890 --> 01:19:32,142
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

875
01:19:40,568 --> 01:19:41,943
You wanna give up?

876
01:19:43,863 --> 01:19:45,405
You wanna sit here and die?

877
01:19:45,489 --> 01:19:46,906
Tell me,

878
01:19:46,991 --> 01:19:50,493
and I will sit here and die with you.

879
01:20:15,811 --> 01:20:17,645
You gonna go get that truck?

880
01:21:26,298 --> 01:21:28,508
Blackbird 2, this is T.O.C.

881
01:21:28,592 --> 01:21:31,886
We are approaching T minus ten minutes.
Confirm status.

882
01:21:31,971 --> 01:21:34,597
This is Blackbird 2...

883
01:21:52,283 --> 01:21:53,741
All units, this is T.O.C.

884
01:21:53,826 --> 01:21:55,743
Be advised we are at ready status.

885
01:21:55,828 --> 01:21:58,329
Proceed to countdown.

886
01:21:58,414 --> 01:22:00,582
Countdown procedure initiated.

887
01:22:00,666 --> 01:22:03,376
We are at T minus ten minutes.

888
01:22:03,460 --> 01:22:05,295
All right. Blackbird 2 is in the air-

889
01:22:10,467 --> 01:22:11,676
Truck!

890
01:23:34,468 --> 01:23:37,261
Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

891
01:25:44,223 --> 01:25:45,348
Honey, it's fine.

892
01:25:45,432 --> 01:25:46,849
It's okay.

893
01:25:46,934 --> 01:25:48,851
Oh, shit.

894
01:25:54,024 --> 01:25:55,191
Oh, fuck.

895
01:26:01,281 --> 01:26:04,617
David, honey,
how's it going there?

896
01:26:04,701 --> 01:26:06,619
We're gonna get there.

897
01:26:06,703 --> 01:26:11,165
Oh, shit. Baby, come on.
Come on. Come on.

898
01:26:12,251 --> 01:26:13,251
David.

899
01:26:13,335 --> 01:26:16,587
God damn it!

900
01:26:16,672 --> 01:26:18,714
David, come on.

901
01:26:18,799 --> 01:26:20,758
- Hurry up.
- God damn it.

902
01:26:23,053 --> 01:26:25,096
I'm sorry. It's okay.

903
01:26:25,180 --> 01:26:27,473
They've gotta be in here somewhere,
David. Come on.

904
01:26:27,558 --> 01:26:29,725
- Just keep looking.
- Oh, fuck me. Just-

905
01:26:29,810 --> 01:26:32,019
Jesus, David.
What are you doing?

906
01:26:34,523 --> 01:26:35,815
Come on, baby. Come on.

907
01:26:38,068 --> 01:26:39,193
David!

908
01:26:39,278 --> 01:26:42,697
David! Quick! Come on!

909
01:26:47,369 --> 01:26:49,579
David!

910
01:28:23,215 --> 01:28:26,092
Let's get the fuck out of here, huh?

911
01:28:45,862 --> 01:28:48,447
The smallest, straightest road
to Cedar Rapids.

912
01:28:48,532 --> 01:28:50,366
Yeah. Perfect.

913
01:28:55,122 --> 01:28:56,747

01:28:56,832 --> 01:28:58,833

Anything?

929
01:29:51,636 --> 01:29:53,262
No.

930
01:30:10,322 --> 01:30:12,782
- Oh, my God.
- Oh!

931
01:30:19,623 --> 01:30:20,915
Get down!

932
01:31:13,051 --> 01:31:15,010
Hey, come on.

933

Come on. Here.

Yeah?

Come on. Come on.

939
01:31:43,248 --> 01:31:44,748
Huh?

940
01:31:48,211 --> 01:31:49,753
Yeah.

941
01:32:30,545 --> 01:32:31,837
Ow.

942
01:32:31,922 --> 01:32:33,422
Oh. Sorry, honey.

We want to update you
on late-breaking news.

945
01:34:18,153 --> 01:34:21,238
A massive fire in Ogden Marsh
continues to rage,

946
01:34:21,323 --> 01:34:23,157
and high winds are preventing fire teams

947
01:34:23,241 --> 01:34:25,034
from containing the deadly blaze.

948
01:34:25,118 --> 01:34:28,287
Now, information is still coming in,
but what we currently know:

949
01:34:28,371 --> 01:34:32,207
An explosion rocked the Dakon Petrol
chemical plant early this morning,

950
01:34:32,292 --> 01:34:36,462
with eyewitness reports
of a 400-foot fireball that lit up the sky.

951
01:34:36,546 --> 01:34:38,714
We also have reports
of a second explosion

952
01:34:38,798 --> 01:34:40,924
at a nearby truck fueling station.

953
01:34:41,009 --> 01:34:44,178
A perimeter has been set
in an effort to contain the blaze,

954
01:34:44,262 --> 01:34:46,013
and civilians are not being permitted
into that area.
