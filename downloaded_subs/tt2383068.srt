1
00:00:55,012 --> 00:00:59,588
Hi. I'm Sam Turner and we're here at VICE
Headquarters in Williamsburg, Brooklyn

2
00:00:59,589 --> 00:01:01,590
with one of our favorite
fashion photographers,

3
00:01:01,591 --> 00:01:04,593
Patrick Carter. Just a few nights
ago, we were all hanging out together

4
00:01:04,594 --> 00:01:08,663
when he let slip a comment about his
sister that had us practically speechless

5
00:01:08,664 --> 00:01:10,166
for the better part of an hour.

6
00:01:10,167 --> 00:01:12,944
After hearing the full story,
we immediately thought,

7
00:01:12,945 --> 00:01:15,170
we have got to do a piece on it.

8
00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:40,128
Should I read it?

9
00:01:40,129 --> 00:01:41,364
Read it.

10
00:01:41,365 --> 00:01:45,101
Okay, it says, "Dear Patrick, sorry you
have not heard from me in so long.

11
00:01:45,102 --> 00:01:47,869
I have been working hard with
everyone to build a community

12
00:01:47,870 --> 00:01:50,138
where we can finally live
free as God intended.

13
00:01:50,139 --> 00:01:52,340
We're not there yet,
but we're so close.

14
00:01:52,342 --> 00:01:55,877
It's the most beautiful place I have ever
been and I would love if you came to visit.

15
00:01:55,878 --> 00:01:58,622
We have so much love here
but I miss your face."

16
00:01:59,215 --> 00:02:01,904
Then it says "Love, Caroline,"
and there's a phone number.

17
00:02:30,545 --> 00:02:32,248
We've been to some
of the most chaotic,

18
00:02:32,249 --> 00:02:34,649
fucked up, war-torn
places in the world,

19
00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:39,554
but never somewhere for something
as personal and bizarre as this.

20
00:02:39,555 --> 00:02:41,923
So here we are, about
to leave New York City,

21
00:02:41,924 --> 00:02:45,528
to set out to find your sister
in a remote part of the world,

22
00:02:45,529 --> 00:02:48,830
to see what this community she is
living in is really all about.

23
00:02:48,831 --> 00:02:53,375
Maybe we can call this one the "VICE
guide to the Carter family reunion".

24
00:03:39,081 --> 00:03:43,618
<i>One night to be confused
one night to speed up truth</i>

25
00:03:43,619 --> 00:03:46,888
<i>We had a promise made</i>

26
00:03:46,889 --> 00:03:49,592
<i>Four hands and then away</i>

27
00:03:49,593 --> 00:03:52,328
<i>Both under influence</i>

28
00:03:52,329 --> 00:03:55,097
<i>We had divine scent</i>

29
00:03:55,098 --> 00:03:57,399
<i>To know what to say</i>

30
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:00,236
<i>Mind is a razor blade</i>

31
00:04:00,237 --> 00:04:03,973
<i>To call for hands of above</i>

32
00:04:03,974 --> 00:04:06,108
<i>To lean on</i>

33
00:04:06,109 --> 00:04:11,954
<i>Wouldn't be good enough for me, no</i>

34
00:04:33,034 --> 00:04:36,772
<i>To call for hands of above</i>

35
00:04:36,773 --> 00:04:38,673
<i>To lean on</i>

36
00:04:38,675 --> 00:04:44,920
<i>Wouldn't be good enough for me, no</i>

37
00:05:07,203 --> 00:05:10,573
I'll be back tomorrow at 8:00 a.m.

38
00:05:10,574 --> 00:05:14,843
I'll wait for one hour and then I
will leave. With or without you.

39
00:05:14,844 --> 00:05:19,188
- Don't worry, we'll be here.
- I'm not worried. 8:00 a.m.

40
00:05:31,694 --> 00:05:34,703
- Who is Patrick?
- Yeah. That's me.

41
00:05:36,065 --> 00:05:38,207
We were not told you'd
be bringing others.

42
00:05:39,367 --> 00:05:40,736
There are three total.

43
00:05:40,737 --> 00:05:42,437
Is there a problem?
We're all together.

44
00:05:42,438 --> 00:05:46,549
We have to get clearance to bring them to
the Parish. Please, stop filming me, sir.

45
00:05:49,878 --> 00:05:51,880
They came with me.
I can't just leave them here.

46
00:05:51,881 --> 00:05:56,585
My sister invited us. My sister's
name is Caroline Carter.

47
00:05:56,586 --> 00:05:57,886
Hold on.

48
00:05:57,887 --> 00:06:00,222
- I don't understand if there's problem.
- Hold on.

49
00:06:00,223 --> 00:06:01,997
It should be all arranged.

50
00:06:04,627 --> 00:06:06,228
<i>Okay. Bring them in.</i>

51
00:06:06,229 --> 00:06:09,371
Copy that. It's okay.

52
00:06:10,465 --> 00:06:13,375
- Come with me.
- Let's go.

53
00:06:15,137 --> 00:06:17,139
It's okay.

54
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:20,542
- Get in the back.
- The truck?

55
00:06:20,543 --> 00:06:22,251
Get in the back.

56
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,642
So far so good.

57
00:07:09,458 --> 00:07:11,526
Well, here we are,
we made it, kind of.

58
00:07:11,527 --> 00:07:14,162
We don't have a local fixer on this one,
and the first thing that happens is

59
00:07:14,163 --> 00:07:16,598
Patrick almost getting into an
argument with one of our guides.

60
00:07:16,599 --> 00:07:18,100
You know those are the
guys you want on your side

61
00:07:18,101 --> 00:07:19,968
when you are out in
places like this.

62
00:07:19,969 --> 00:07:23,205
Maybe New York has made me soft,
but these are the moments,

63
00:07:23,206 --> 00:07:25,474
every time we make one of
these things, where I realize

64
00:07:25,475 --> 00:07:26,875
- it might have been the worst idea ever.
- No, we've definitely had worse ideas.

65
00:07:26,876 --> 00:07:29,785
No, we've definitely
had worse ideas.

66
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:33,949
I don't know why you're laughing.
Get a shot of his shoes.

67
00:07:33,950 --> 00:07:37,718
Where did you think you were
going, wearing shoes like those?

68
00:07:37,719 --> 00:07:39,554
I thought you traveled
for work all the time?

69
00:07:39,555 --> 00:07:41,823
Yeah, to LA, and fucking Paris.

70
00:07:41,824 --> 00:07:45,060
Closest I come to this shit is shooting
some model in a field in Jersey.

71
00:07:45,061 --> 00:07:47,970
Dude, you're in fashion,
you should own some boots.

72
00:08:12,354 --> 00:08:13,996
Turn the camera off!

73
00:08:17,092 --> 00:08:20,315
Turn it off! Turn it off!

74
00:08:29,671 --> 00:08:33,041
So things have not improved.

75
00:08:33,042 --> 00:08:37,245
We didn't get shot, but
we have to be careful

76
00:08:37,246 --> 00:08:39,681
not to let them catch us filming.

77
00:08:39,682 --> 00:08:43,418
Patrick is over there explaining
who we are, what we're doing.

78
00:08:43,419 --> 00:08:47,763
I'm not sure if that will
make things better or worse.

79
00:08:48,390 --> 00:08:52,034
We're hoping that he can find his
sister and straighten all this out.

80
00:08:52,928 --> 00:08:56,198
And if Patrick starts to get shot
at, I'm going the fuck that way.

81
00:08:56,199 --> 00:08:58,274
As quickly as possible.

82
00:08:59,034 --> 00:09:04,906
They want our passports, but I'm not
giving up my passport to anybody.

83
00:09:04,907 --> 00:09:08,643
Also, there is some
talk of a donation.

84
00:09:08,644 --> 00:09:12,047
Not sure how sizeable
that donation has to be.

85
00:09:12,048 --> 00:09:16,425
So far this is nothing at all like the
hippie commune we were expecting.

86
00:09:17,452 --> 00:09:19,821
- Patrick?
- Okay. See, there she is.

87
00:09:19,822 --> 00:09:22,130
Hey, it's okay guys. It's okay.

88
00:09:22,924 --> 00:09:27,536
Caroline, did you tell them?
All right, come on guys.

89
00:09:31,833 --> 00:09:34,153
- Oh, I'm so glad you're here.
- I'm so glad to see you.

90
00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:38,073
- What's with all this?
- Oh, I'll explain it inside.

91
00:09:38,074 --> 00:09:39,106
- Hi.
- Hi.

92
00:09:39,107 --> 00:09:43,178
- I'm Caroline. Nice to meet you. You too.
- I'm Sam, this is Jake.

93
00:09:43,179 --> 00:09:47,482
Hi. We didn't know you
were coming. I'm so sorry.

94
00:09:47,483 --> 00:09:48,984
It's just... We're really
happy to have you.

95
00:09:48,985 --> 00:09:51,253
There's someone cleaning out
a cabin right now for you both.

96
00:09:51,254 --> 00:09:52,320
Great.

97
00:09:52,321 --> 00:09:56,591
- Is it all right if I keep filming?
- Yeah. Yeah, of course, of course.

98
00:09:56,592 --> 00:09:58,117
You can film whatever you like.

99
00:09:58,144 --> 00:10:01,363
I would just hope that you would
leave this last experience out.

100
00:10:01,364 --> 00:10:04,266
It in no way reflects what
you are about to see.

101
00:10:04,267 --> 00:10:07,269
The guns are just a precautionary
measure because of where we are.

102
00:10:07,270 --> 00:10:09,638
Down here everything needs
some level of security.

103
00:10:09,639 --> 00:10:11,640
- Sure, we understand.
- You want to go inside?

104
00:10:11,641 --> 00:10:15,317
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Yeah? Okay, cool. Thanks, guys.

105
00:10:21,483 --> 00:10:23,885
My God, I can't believe I'm
looking at you right now.

106
00:10:23,886 --> 00:10:27,222
- Your hair is so short.
- Yeah, I cut it.

107
00:10:27,223 --> 00:10:29,991
- You look good. You look healthy.
- Thank you.

108
00:10:29,992 --> 00:10:31,810
Oh, just wait until you see it all. Here
we are.Welcome to Eden Parish.

109
00:10:31,811 --> 00:10:33,662
Oh, just wait until you see it all.

110
00:10:33,663 --> 00:10:36,531
Here we are. Welcome
to Eden Parish.

111
00:10:36,532 --> 00:10:39,234
What do you think?
It's great, right?

112
00:10:39,235 --> 00:10:45,240
<i>Children, we have some special
visitors to the parish today.</i>

113
00:10:45,241 --> 00:10:47,376
<i>Let's show them our hospitality</i>

114
00:10:47,377 --> 00:10:50,512
<i>and represent ourselves in the
ways the Lord has taught us.</i>

115
00:10:50,513 --> 00:10:52,881
<i>- God bless you all.</i>
- Oh, yeah.

116
00:10:52,882 --> 00:10:56,817
I don't think that we slept more
than three hours in a night

117
00:10:56,818 --> 00:10:59,186
for six months when
we were building it.

118
00:10:59,187 --> 00:11:02,691
But Father had a vision, and
he was of course right.

119
00:11:02,692 --> 00:11:06,535
And we built Heaven here on Earth.

120
00:11:07,329 --> 00:11:10,665
- Who is Father?
- Oh, right. Yeah.

121
00:11:10,666 --> 00:11:13,402
Probably sounds weird
to you guys, huh?

122
00:11:13,403 --> 00:11:16,538
Well, he's the guy that
started all of this.

123
00:11:16,539 --> 00:11:20,575
He's the reason that I'm still alive.
He's the reason that all of us are here.

124
00:11:20,576 --> 00:11:23,045
He's a genius, I swear.

125
00:11:23,046 --> 00:11:27,349
I know it sounds strange, but we all call
him that because it's just easier for us.

126
00:11:27,350 --> 00:11:30,452
- Is that him on the loud speaker?
- Uh-huh.

127
00:11:30,453 --> 00:11:31,953
Can we speak with
him at some point?

128
00:11:31,954 --> 00:11:33,789
Um.

129
00:11:33,790 --> 00:11:37,559
Let me see what I can do. I know you guys
are Patrick's friends and everything,

130
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:40,095
but we've got to be really
careful about media exposure.

131
00:11:40,096 --> 00:11:43,432
None of this would be possible
without some level of secrecy.

132
00:11:43,433 --> 00:11:46,468
Secrecy, from whom? People like us?

133
00:11:46,469 --> 00:11:48,603
Or you mean like the
local government?

134
00:11:48,604 --> 00:11:51,206
A little of both.

135
00:11:51,207 --> 00:11:54,376
There are some people out there
that want to stop what we're doing.

136
00:11:54,377 --> 00:11:57,212
They think it's wrong, but
I personally have no idea

137
00:11:57,213 --> 00:11:59,715
why anyone would think
that this was wrong.

138
00:11:59,716 --> 00:12:01,750
I've never been so happy
in my entire life,

139
00:12:01,751 --> 00:12:04,720
and we grew up wealthy
on the upper west side.

140
00:12:04,721 --> 00:12:08,255
But that's not living, at least
not to me. This is living.

141
00:12:08,256 --> 00:12:10,492
We all built this
together as a community.

142
00:12:10,493 --> 00:12:13,068
We would do anything
to keep it safe.

143
00:12:16,998 --> 00:12:20,402
So some of our residents
agreed to move out of here

144
00:12:20,403 --> 00:12:23,972
so that you guys could
stay here with us tonight,

145
00:12:23,973 --> 00:12:26,975
but Patrick is going to stay
with me in the main house.

146
00:12:26,976 --> 00:12:29,276
And I know it doesn't
seem like much,

147
00:12:29,277 --> 00:12:31,646
but you guys should be pretty
comfortable for the night.

148
00:12:31,647 --> 00:12:33,280
When we first got here, some
of our residents said that

149
00:12:33,281 --> 00:12:35,617
they had the best
sleep of their lives.

150
00:12:35,618 --> 00:12:37,918
It's so peaceful and just
wait until you see the stars.

151
00:12:37,919 --> 00:12:40,287
- They're so beautiful.
- It's great, thank you.

152
00:12:40,288 --> 00:12:42,858
Should we come find you
once we get settled?

153
00:12:42,859 --> 00:12:45,794
We would actually like to talk to you
at some point if you're cool with that.

154
00:12:45,795 --> 00:12:49,296
Yeah. Sure, sure. Just... but take
your time because I would really

155
00:12:49,297 --> 00:12:53,983
- love to spend some time with my brother.
- Take him, we can't give him away.

156
00:12:54,301 --> 00:12:57,038
But really, if you guys need
anything at all, anything,

157
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:00,442
the main house is just across the
field, just behind that pavilion.

158
00:13:00,443 --> 00:13:01,643
- Do you see it?
- Yeah.

159
00:13:01,644 --> 00:13:04,279
Feel free to just wander around and
get acquainted with the place.

160
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:06,148
Our residents are
really nice people.

161
00:13:06,149 --> 00:13:08,450
- Sounds good.
- Mm-hmm.

162
00:13:08,451 --> 00:13:10,052
- You ready?
- Yeah.

163
00:13:10,053 --> 00:13:11,053
Well, welcome.

164
00:13:11,054 --> 00:13:12,821
- Thanks.
- Mm-hmm.

165
00:13:12,822 --> 00:13:15,690
Okay, I guess I'm going
to go with her for a bit.

166
00:13:15,692 --> 00:13:19,693
- All right. See you in a few.
- Later. See you, man.

167
00:13:27,968 --> 00:13:30,146
You want the top or bottom?

168
00:13:37,079 --> 00:13:40,849
She's selling this place
pretty hard. Right?

169
00:13:40,850 --> 00:13:44,392
- Best night's sleep of your life...
- Yeah.

170
00:13:48,590 --> 00:13:50,092
How freaked out were
you back on the truck?

171
00:13:50,093 --> 00:13:51,801
Dude.

172
00:13:52,359 --> 00:13:54,336
Why did they have machine guns?

173
00:13:56,498 --> 00:13:58,500
I'm gonna switch cards so
if anything gets weird,

174
00:13:58,501 --> 00:14:00,235
we at least have the
footage we shot so far.

175
00:14:00,236 --> 00:14:02,210
Good call.

176
00:14:18,954 --> 00:14:21,890
<i>Peace I give you, children.</i>

177
00:14:21,891 --> 00:14:25,727
<i>Do not let your hearts be
troubled. Do not be afraid.</i>

178
00:14:25,728 --> 00:14:29,029
<i>It's another day for
us in paradise.</i>

179
00:14:29,030 --> 00:14:30,030
Hi.

180
00:14:30,031 --> 00:14:34,236
<i>when brothers and
sisters live in unity.</i>

181
00:14:34,237 --> 00:14:35,469
<i>God bless you all.</i>

182
00:14:35,470 --> 00:14:37,245
Hi.

183
00:14:39,641 --> 00:14:43,518
I do not know who
to approach first.

184
00:14:44,146 --> 00:14:47,355
They'll come to me.
Hey, how you doing?

185
00:14:48,482 --> 00:14:51,127
Not that one, I guess.

186
00:14:58,393 --> 00:15:00,402
Oh, got her. Got her.

187
00:15:05,567 --> 00:15:08,403
- Hi.
- Hi.

188
00:15:08,404 --> 00:15:09,404
How are you?

189
00:15:09,405 --> 00:15:11,573
- I'm fine. How about yourself?
- I'm very well.

190
00:15:11,574 --> 00:15:16,645
My name is Lorraine Davis, but everyone
around here just calls me Miss D.

191
00:15:16,646 --> 00:15:18,814
So how did you get
involved with this place?

192
00:15:18,815 --> 00:15:23,685
Through the church. Now Father had
came into the area where we lived

193
00:15:23,686 --> 00:15:28,456
and I had seen signs
plastered all around town.

194
00:15:28,457 --> 00:15:33,929
Signs inviting people to come out
and to help better themselves

195
00:15:33,930 --> 00:15:37,599
and to get a better
relationship with God.

196
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:41,336
So I went down there to the church

197
00:15:41,337 --> 00:15:45,207
and before that sermon
was over, I was sold.

198
00:15:45,208 --> 00:15:48,610
That man has a way of speaking,

199
00:15:48,611 --> 00:15:53,949
a way of making you just feel better,
and I'd never felt that way before.

200
00:15:53,950 --> 00:15:57,986
And it wasn't long
after that he chose me

201
00:15:57,987 --> 00:16:00,222
to be one of the lucky ones

202
00:16:00,223 --> 00:16:03,358
to come down here and be
a part of all of this.

203
00:16:03,359 --> 00:16:05,493
Oh, were you reluctant
to leave your home?

204
00:16:05,494 --> 00:16:08,496
Oh, no. After my
husband had passed,

205
00:16:08,497 --> 00:16:13,550
there just wasn't
anything here for me.

206
00:16:14,369 --> 00:16:19,341
My faith is what was
most important.

207
00:16:19,342 --> 00:16:23,486
This is right where I belong.

208
00:16:25,347 --> 00:16:27,481
We're with VICE.

209
00:16:27,482 --> 00:16:30,151
We want to talk with someone around
our age about what it's like living here.

210
00:16:30,152 --> 00:16:31,152
I know VICE.

211
00:16:31,153 --> 00:16:34,755
- Cool. Are you from Australia?
- Melbourne, yeah.

212
00:16:34,756 --> 00:16:39,860
How did you end up here? I mean, what were
you doing before you came to this place?

213
00:16:39,861 --> 00:16:42,998
- I was an artist living in Brooklyn.
- What kind of art do you do?

214
00:16:42,999 --> 00:16:46,735
All kinds. Painting,
poetry, performance.

215
00:16:46,736 --> 00:16:49,905
Do you ever miss the technology
you were accustomed to?

216
00:16:49,906 --> 00:16:52,274
Even just communicating easier

217
00:16:52,275 --> 00:16:56,278
or knowing what's going on with the
outside world? You must, a little bit?

218
00:16:56,279 --> 00:16:58,512
I don't need the
internet to communicate.

219
00:16:58,513 --> 00:17:01,049
People lived without it
for thousands of years.

220
00:17:01,050 --> 00:17:03,752
It's just another
unhealthy addiction.

221
00:17:03,753 --> 00:17:06,688
Here we talk to each other in
person, not through satellites.

222
00:17:06,689 --> 00:17:11,666
What about your family in Australia?
Do they know where you are?

223
00:17:12,294 --> 00:17:17,198
This is my family now. Father has
given me more than I ever dreamed of.

224
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:19,433
I'm so grateful for that.

225
00:17:19,434 --> 00:17:22,682
Okay. Fair enough.

226
00:17:23,205 --> 00:17:25,014
Thanks.

227
00:17:32,813 --> 00:17:33,949
Oh, hi.

228
00:17:33,950 --> 00:17:37,786
- Hi. Can we come in?
- Sure.

229
00:17:37,787 --> 00:17:39,721
What is this place?

230
00:17:39,722 --> 00:17:44,726
This is our medical center and
temporarily our day-care.

231
00:17:44,727 --> 00:17:51,098
I help with any conditions our residents
may have, especially our seniors.

232
00:17:51,099 --> 00:17:54,235
And Miss Phoebe in there helps
takes care of some of the children

233
00:17:54,236 --> 00:17:56,338
while their parents
are in the fields.

234
00:17:56,339 --> 00:17:58,340
Are there a lot of
children and seniors here?

235
00:17:58,341 --> 00:18:03,979
Oh, yes. We have over 35 boys
and girls under the age of 10,

236
00:18:03,980 --> 00:18:07,948
and at least 60 or so seniors.

237
00:18:07,949 --> 00:18:11,594
That's how our parish really got
its start, helping those seniors.

238
00:18:12,187 --> 00:18:14,488
Has anyone actually been born here?

239
00:18:14,489 --> 00:18:17,625
Oh, we've birthed
seven babies to date.

240
00:18:17,626 --> 00:18:20,568
Seven? All here?

241
00:18:21,128 --> 00:18:23,171
That's right. Right here.

242
00:18:24,766 --> 00:18:27,268
Why are you so surprised?

243
00:18:27,269 --> 00:18:31,872
People are born around the world every
day in conditions worse than this.

244
00:18:31,873 --> 00:18:35,342
It's not the hospital that has
the baby, it's the mother.

245
00:18:35,343 --> 00:18:37,987
He's just nervous because
his wife's pregnant.

246
00:18:39,014 --> 00:18:42,283
- Really? When is she due?
- Next month.

247
00:18:42,284 --> 00:18:44,285
- Is this your first?
- Yeah.

248
00:18:44,286 --> 00:18:47,521
The first are the most exciting.
Congratulations.

249
00:18:47,522 --> 00:18:49,532
Thank you.

250
00:18:50,158 --> 00:18:53,360
Where do all these supplies come
from? Do you get them locally?

251
00:18:53,361 --> 00:18:55,497
Well, we brought a lot with us,

252
00:18:55,498 --> 00:18:58,899
but thank heavens we haven't needed
to use much of the medication.

253
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:03,370
But we are prepared for
all types of emergencies.

254
00:19:03,371 --> 00:19:05,673
Who pays for it all?

255
00:19:05,674 --> 00:19:07,641
We did.

256
00:19:07,642 --> 00:19:11,046
Well, in so many words, anyway.

257
00:19:11,047 --> 00:19:16,650
When many of us first came to the
parish, we sold everything we had.

258
00:19:16,651 --> 00:19:20,387
When several hundred people come
together, you would be surprised

259
00:19:20,389 --> 00:19:22,757
that how much you can
get accomplished.

260
00:19:22,758 --> 00:19:25,427
Everyone just gave up what
they had to come here?

261
00:19:25,428 --> 00:19:30,265
That's right. We sold our homes and
we donated the profits to the church.

262
00:19:30,266 --> 00:19:32,807
And we would do it again.

263
00:19:33,768 --> 00:19:39,206
Father is a businessman
on top of all things.

264
00:19:39,207 --> 00:19:42,817
Sometimes that gets overlooked.

265
00:19:57,459 --> 00:19:59,860
- So where are you guys from?
- Oh, we're from the hood, man.

266
00:19:59,861 --> 00:20:00,929
Yeah.

267
00:20:00,930 --> 00:20:02,229
I'm saying we had nothing
where we was from.

268
00:20:02,230 --> 00:20:06,066
You know, five of us lived in two rooms.
And that's how you want to live?

269
00:20:06,068 --> 00:20:10,237
Me, Robert, our mother and two sisters,
we all came down here together.

270
00:20:10,238 --> 00:20:14,074
And I mean, honestly, it's just changed
us. We're from a violent community.

271
00:20:14,076 --> 00:20:17,711
I don't know, man. If we
didn't come down here,

272
00:20:17,713 --> 00:20:20,315
- God knows what would have happened to us.
- Oh, yeah, yeah, if you had told us

273
00:20:20,316 --> 00:20:23,118
we'll be out there with the white
dudes and all these people...

274
00:20:23,119 --> 00:20:25,226
Yeah, yeah. We'd just
say you was crazy.

275
00:20:25,954 --> 00:20:30,391
It's like, we look at you all and
it's like you are the crazy ones.

276
00:20:30,392 --> 00:20:33,328
Yeah. I mean... This is how
we're supposed to be living.

277
00:20:33,329 --> 00:20:35,497
You know, everybody
here is in it together.

278
00:20:35,498 --> 00:20:36,498
That's right.

279
00:20:36,499 --> 00:20:39,266
You know, there's no one man for
himself, it's like God watches over us.

280
00:20:39,267 --> 00:20:40,901
Yeah.

281
00:20:40,902 --> 00:20:42,403
- We watch over each other.
- That's right, man.

282
00:20:42,404 --> 00:20:45,773
Do you see yourself ever going
back to the United States?

283
00:20:45,774 --> 00:20:50,111
Never. There's no point.
I ain't never going back, man.

284
00:20:50,112 --> 00:20:53,914
I'd die before I go back.
It's real.

285
00:20:53,915 --> 00:20:56,016
Hey, can I play some
ball with you guys?

286
00:20:56,017 --> 00:20:57,152
Yeah, man.

287
00:20:57,153 --> 00:20:58,153
Come on.

288
00:20:58,154 --> 00:21:01,396
- Can he ball? He can really ball.
- No.

289
00:21:32,052 --> 00:21:33,954
<i>So we talked to a bunch
of the people here</i>

290
00:21:33,955 --> 00:21:36,558
<i>and what we know so far
is that everyone thinks</i>

291
00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:39,027
<i>this is the best place
they've ever been.</i>

292
00:21:39,028 --> 00:21:40,961
<i>They have their own farming,
their own medical center,</i>

293
00:21:40,962 --> 00:21:43,330
<i>their own daycare,
their own everything.</i>

294
00:21:43,331 --> 00:21:46,801
<i>As far as utopias go, it has
something for everybody.</i>

295
00:21:46,802 --> 00:21:49,204
If it's spirituality
you want, they got it.

296
00:21:49,205 --> 00:21:51,705
If it's progressive
politics, they got it.

297
00:21:51,706 --> 00:21:54,074
If it's a technology
free hippy lifestyle

298
00:21:54,076 --> 00:21:56,578
you're looking for,
they got that, too.

299
00:21:56,579 --> 00:22:00,714
I can't help but think desperation is
a lot of what brought people here,

300
00:22:00,716 --> 00:22:04,893
but if they're happy now,
who am I to say anything?

301
00:22:05,486 --> 00:22:09,090
We're about to head to the main house to
meet back up with Patrick and Caroline

302
00:22:09,091 --> 00:22:13,228
to see if we can do an interview with
this Father everyone keeps talking about.

303
00:22:13,229 --> 00:22:16,497
I'm trying to keep it together, so
I can ask intelligent questions,

304
00:22:16,498 --> 00:22:21,075
but jet lag's kicked in and
I am starting to melt.

305
00:22:22,604 --> 00:22:24,439
Jake, what do you think
of all this so far?

306
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:28,316
Give me your
professional assessment.

307
00:22:31,011 --> 00:22:32,880
Um, I don't know.

308
00:22:32,881 --> 00:22:36,224
I mean, I'm naturally
cynical, but...

309
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:42,123
The fact that a bunch of
drug addicts and alcoholics

310
00:22:42,124 --> 00:22:45,433
actually pulled this thing together
is a little bit impressive.

311
00:22:46,628 --> 00:22:50,338
Fact that they sold all their
worldly possessions to do it.

312
00:22:51,266 --> 00:22:54,709
I don't know, just throws up the
red flag for me a little bit.

313
00:22:55,270 --> 00:22:59,974
I feel like, I mean, if this
is like a place to come

314
00:22:59,975 --> 00:23:05,045
and get clean or do a little bit of
thinking for a month, it's perfect.

315
00:23:05,047 --> 00:23:08,249
I think it is an actual
sustainable lifestyle for,

316
00:23:08,250 --> 00:23:12,153
you know, 60 something
elderly people.

317
00:23:12,154 --> 00:23:14,155
I mean, that medical
center is great,

318
00:23:14,156 --> 00:23:19,601
but that's not really going to cut
it, in my professional opinion.

319
00:23:26,167 --> 00:23:29,878
- What are you gonna ask this guy?
- I don't know yet.

320
00:23:30,938 --> 00:23:32,573
Are you going in
with tough questions

321
00:23:32,574 --> 00:23:35,250
or you're just gonna wait
and see what the vibe is?

322
00:23:35,943 --> 00:23:37,812
I'm coming at him.

323
00:23:37,813 --> 00:23:39,180
Okay.

324
00:23:39,181 --> 00:23:43,658
Well, I'm gonna see if he'll wear a
wire, gonna try and mic you guys up.

325
00:23:48,022 --> 00:23:50,298
Sam, we got a little one.

326
00:23:54,795 --> 00:23:56,539
Hi.

327
00:23:57,165 --> 00:23:58,833
What's your name?

328
00:23:58,834 --> 00:24:03,838
Savannah. There you are. Well, I've
been looking all over for you.

329
00:24:03,839 --> 00:24:07,174
- Hi, Savannah.
- Don't mind her. She is a mute.

330
00:24:07,175 --> 00:24:08,209
Oh.

331
00:24:08,210 --> 00:24:11,479
- You friends of Caroline's?
- Yeah. We're with VICE.

332
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:13,648
We want to maybe do a
story about this place.

333
00:24:14,215 --> 00:24:17,719
- What kind of a story?
- We don't really know yet.

334
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:19,563
You're not gonna make
fun of us, are you?

335
00:24:19,564 --> 00:24:23,858
No, not at all. We were just
saying how impressive all this is.

336
00:24:23,859 --> 00:24:24,839
I see.

337
00:24:24,866 --> 00:24:27,194
Hey, would you mind doing
a quick interview?

338
00:24:27,195 --> 00:24:29,438
We talked with a few people
about how they ended up here

339
00:24:29,439 --> 00:24:31,332
and it'd be great if we could get

340
00:24:31,333 --> 00:24:33,868
- a mother's perspective on that.
- No, thank you.

341
00:24:33,869 --> 00:24:39,340
We're not allowed to talk about the
Parish, especially to outsiders.

342
00:24:39,341 --> 00:24:41,216
Come on, sweetheart.

343
00:24:44,645 --> 00:24:47,989
- Did she just call us outsiders?
- Yeah.

344
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:55,997
- It's kind of a different vibe, huh?
- Yeah.

345
00:25:08,536 --> 00:25:10,571
- Hey.
- Hey.

346
00:25:10,572 --> 00:25:13,240
How are you doing?
I'll see you guys later.

347
00:25:13,241 --> 00:25:15,676
- You guys enjoying yourselves so far?
- Definitely.

348
00:25:15,677 --> 00:25:17,412
Yeah? So good news.

349
00:25:17,413 --> 00:25:20,448
I spoke with Father and he agreed
to allow you an interview.

350
00:25:20,449 --> 00:25:21,515
- Great.
- Yeah.

351
00:25:21,516 --> 00:25:23,684
He is not really feeling
very well right now.

352
00:25:23,685 --> 00:25:26,120
- He just took some of his medication.
- Oh, is he sick?

353
00:25:26,121 --> 00:25:27,688
No. It's nothing serious.

354
00:25:27,689 --> 00:25:30,524
It's just sometimes the
medication upsets his stomach.

355
00:25:30,525 --> 00:25:34,195
So he agreed to sit for an interview
tonight at the gathering.

356
00:25:34,196 --> 00:25:37,410
We're planning an event for your
visit. It should be really fun...

357
00:25:37,411 --> 00:25:40,301
It's gonna be music and dancing,
you'll love it, especially you.

358
00:25:40,302 --> 00:25:45,072
So we would love it if you would
look over this document I prepared.

359
00:25:45,073 --> 00:25:47,708
It'll give you a little bit
more information about us

360
00:25:47,709 --> 00:25:49,710
and it should help
with your questions.

361
00:25:49,711 --> 00:25:53,120
He is only gonna sit for half an
hour and then the party will begin.

362
00:25:53,714 --> 00:25:55,149
What time does the party start?

363
00:25:55,150 --> 00:25:59,820
It begins at sun down. If you just want
to meet me in front of the pavilion,

364
00:25:59,821 --> 00:26:01,222
and then I'll take
care of the rest.

365
00:26:01,223 --> 00:26:03,324
- Perfect. Thank you.
- Okay. Of course.

366
00:26:03,325 --> 00:26:04,792
We have nothing to hide.

367
00:26:04,793 --> 00:26:08,229
So if you'll excuse me, I have some
more planning to do before tonight,

368
00:26:08,230 --> 00:26:09,430
so I'll just see you
guys in a little bit.

369
00:26:09,431 --> 00:26:11,465
- Sounds good.
- Okay.

370
00:26:11,466 --> 00:26:13,708
- Yeah. Thanks, Caroline.
- Mm-hmm.

371
00:26:15,603 --> 00:26:16,971
How is it going, man?

372
00:26:16,972 --> 00:26:19,240
Man, I got some amazing
pictures so far, dude.

373
00:26:19,241 --> 00:26:21,716
I can make a whole
book out of this.

374
00:26:22,743 --> 00:26:26,721
Look at these faces, man. Jesus.

375
00:26:27,248 --> 00:26:30,409
You know, I can make something really cool
out of this and it'd be great for me,

376
00:26:30,415 --> 00:26:33,377
What have you guys been up to?
Well, we talked to a bunch of the locals.

377
00:26:35,623 --> 00:26:38,733
Oh, no, that's what my ticket
on fashion looks like.

378
00:26:40,127 --> 00:26:44,239
- What have you guys been up to?
- Well, we talked to a bunch of the locals.

379
00:26:44,865 --> 00:26:46,367
- And?
- It's pretty wild.

380
00:26:46,368 --> 00:26:48,869
Yeah.

381
00:26:48,870 --> 00:26:50,979
Strange group of people.

382
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:54,315
Nah, it's incredible.

383
00:26:54,842 --> 00:26:57,511
Had a few bizarre
interactions, but you know...

384
00:26:57,512 --> 00:27:01,515
Where I'm staying, a full extra bedroom,
office, can't even wrap my head around it.

385
00:27:01,516 --> 00:27:05,486
The construction aspect is pretty
impressive I have to admit.

386
00:27:05,487 --> 00:27:09,657
Do you think your... Do you think
your sister wants to stay?

387
00:27:09,658 --> 00:27:13,027
It seems like it. I thought I was gonna
have to come here and rescue her

388
00:27:13,028 --> 00:27:15,529
but she seems good and she's
definitely done worse.

389
00:27:15,530 --> 00:27:18,839
I don't know how I'm gonna describe
this to my parents, but...

390
00:27:19,533 --> 00:27:22,403
Um, we're rolling, so
let's do that letter.

391
00:27:22,404 --> 00:27:24,279
All right.

392
00:27:30,911 --> 00:27:32,646
"Distinguished guests..."

393
00:27:32,647 --> 00:27:35,916
Well, does it say
distinguished guests?

394
00:27:35,917 --> 00:27:37,918
Says it.

395
00:27:37,919 --> 00:27:39,920
"Welcome to Eden Parish.

396
00:27:39,921 --> 00:27:43,557
Father wants only to create a community
where peace and love are cherished,

397
00:27:43,558 --> 00:27:46,761
where the needs of one another are met on
equal levels as we're all God's children

398
00:27:46,762 --> 00:27:49,195
and it is how He Himself
intended us to live.

399
00:27:49,196 --> 00:27:51,932
We do not seek to isolate
ourselves from the outside world,

400
00:27:51,933 --> 00:27:55,703
but we do seek a distance from
imperialism, violence, poverty, racism

401
00:27:55,704 --> 00:27:58,906
and all other unacceptable
attacks on basic human rights.

402
00:27:58,907 --> 00:28:02,343
These conditions have all become
commonplace in modern societies.

403
00:28:02,344 --> 00:28:06,212
Father created Eden Parish not as a place
to get away, but as a place to start over.

404
00:28:06,213 --> 00:28:11,085
It is a new beginning. Sincerely, the
loving congregation of Eden Parish."

405
00:28:11,086 --> 00:28:15,830
Define imperialism.
Define imperialism.

406
00:28:16,924 --> 00:28:18,700
Idiots.

407
00:28:23,197 --> 00:28:26,207
- You're getting a signal?
- No.

408
00:28:26,734 --> 00:28:28,102
Okay.

409
00:28:28,103 --> 00:28:29,833
What are you doing on your phone?

410
00:28:31,439 --> 00:28:35,943
Dude, she is still gonna be pregnant
tomorrow when you get home.

411
00:28:35,944 --> 00:28:37,578
They might have a satellite
phone in the office.

412
00:28:37,579 --> 00:28:39,245
They don't have a satellite
phone in the office.

413
00:28:39,246 --> 00:28:42,750
You know, you don't need to
encourage this kind of behavior.

414
00:28:42,751 --> 00:28:44,250
Okay but I saw a room
with a lot of equipment.

415
00:28:44,251 --> 00:28:46,861
He is fine. You're fine.

416
00:28:57,098 --> 00:28:58,499
<i>Would all Parish members</i>

417
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:01,635
<i>please report to the
pavilion no later than 7:45.</i>

418
00:29:01,636 --> 00:29:04,738
<i>We're having a very
special meeting tonight,</i>

419
00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:10,484
<i>for Father and our visitors. Everyone
is required to attend. God bless.</i>

420
00:29:21,155 --> 00:29:23,624
So we're gonna have you
guys set up over here

421
00:29:23,625 --> 00:29:25,925
and then Father will come out
when you guys are ready.

422
00:29:25,926 --> 00:29:28,028
Wait, hold up. We're doing
this in front of everybody?

423
00:29:28,029 --> 00:29:30,164
Yeah. That's right.

424
00:29:30,165 --> 00:29:34,409
Great. So just let me know
when you're all set, okay?

425
00:29:38,639 --> 00:29:40,641
- Hey, Patrick?
- Yeah.

426
00:29:40,642 --> 00:29:43,444
- Hey, man, does your camera shoot video?
- Yeah.

427
00:29:43,445 --> 00:29:45,813
Think you could help me get
some video during this?

428
00:29:45,814 --> 00:29:49,657
Definitely. Where do you
want me to shoot from?

429
00:29:52,019 --> 00:29:54,155
I mean, anywhere where you
can get a good shot of Sam

430
00:29:54,156 --> 00:29:58,292
asking some questions and
then you can flip around

431
00:29:58,293 --> 00:30:00,828
and get some shots of
people, that'd be awesome.

432
00:30:00,829 --> 00:30:02,530
All right, maybe I'll
just set up over here.

433
00:30:02,531 --> 00:30:04,371
Yeah. Thanks, man.

434
00:30:08,334 --> 00:30:11,312
Well, light looks pretty good.

435
00:31:00,888 --> 00:31:02,356
Father's here!

436
00:31:55,508 --> 00:31:57,011
Hi.

437
00:31:57,012 --> 00:31:58,987
Nice to meet you.

438
00:32:01,315 --> 00:32:04,150
Yeah. All right, all right.

439
00:32:04,151 --> 00:32:05,953
Let me get rigged up here.

440
00:32:05,954 --> 00:32:08,189
All right. All right.

441
00:32:08,190 --> 00:32:12,693
Well, I trust your stay so
far has been hospitable.

442
00:32:12,694 --> 00:32:16,095
What we lack in modern comfort,
we make up for in humanity.

443
00:32:16,097 --> 00:32:17,096
Isn't that right?

444
00:32:22,336 --> 00:32:23,838
It's been pretty amazing.

445
00:32:23,839 --> 00:32:25,673
Everyone we talked to
seems to feel that

446
00:32:25,674 --> 00:32:28,541
this is everything they ever wanted
and they all credit you for that.

447
00:32:28,542 --> 00:32:30,711
Oh, I don't deserve the credit.

448
00:32:30,712 --> 00:32:32,847
We all did this together.

449
00:32:32,848 --> 00:32:35,983
We built this place
from the ground up.

450
00:32:35,984 --> 00:32:40,988
This is our community and you being our
visitors, it is just as much yours.

451
00:32:40,989 --> 00:32:42,664
That's what we believe in.

452
00:32:44,491 --> 00:32:45,726
I want to talk more about that,

453
00:32:45,727 --> 00:32:48,362
but I would love to get some
basics out of the way first.

454
00:32:48,363 --> 00:32:50,998
Are you feeling better? Caroline mentioned
you were little under the whether earlier,

455
00:32:50,999 --> 00:32:54,501
- so I hope this is not too much.
- Oh, yeah. I'm fine.

456
00:32:54,502 --> 00:32:55,736
Great.

457
00:32:55,737 --> 00:32:58,706
Okay, so first off.
Can I ask your real name?

458
00:32:58,707 --> 00:33:02,343
Everybody here has been calling you
Father and I wonder how that started.

459
00:33:02,344 --> 00:33:04,486
Well, it's a nickname.

460
00:33:05,346 --> 00:33:08,883
I don't remember exactly when it
started, but it was many years ago.

461
00:33:08,884 --> 00:33:14,388
Some people see anyone who extends
a helping hand as a father figure.

462
00:33:14,389 --> 00:33:16,856
And yes, that's where it came from.

463
00:33:16,857 --> 00:33:20,661
My given name is
Charles Anderson Reed.

464
00:33:20,662 --> 00:33:22,228
That's a great name.

465
00:33:22,229 --> 00:33:25,766
Where are you from and how
did all of this get started?

466
00:33:25,767 --> 00:33:27,034
Can you take us through it?

467
00:33:27,035 --> 00:33:30,771
Oh, I am from all over, friend.

468
00:33:30,772 --> 00:33:35,835
I've been in every big city and every
small town. And you know what I found?

469
00:33:36,044 --> 00:33:43,023
Poverty, violence,
greed and racism.

470
00:33:44,051 --> 00:33:49,056
The foundations of a cancerous society
and I felt it to make a difference.

471
00:33:49,057 --> 00:33:51,792
You see all these
people here tonight?

472
00:33:51,793 --> 00:33:55,562
They all came here because
they had nothing.

473
00:33:55,563 --> 00:33:59,767
They were born outcast.
Never given a chance.

474
00:33:59,768 --> 00:34:02,069
I know, 'cause so was I.

475
00:34:02,070 --> 00:34:08,575
Society turned its back on these
people years ago, but I never will.

476
00:34:08,576 --> 00:34:12,313
I grew up poor. I know that pain.

477
00:34:12,314 --> 00:34:17,051
I know what it's like to
lose hope, to feel trapped.

478
00:34:17,052 --> 00:34:18,953
Well, there's none of that here.

479
00:34:18,954 --> 00:34:21,322
You come down here and I'll
give you a place to live.

480
00:34:21,323 --> 00:34:24,825
I'll give you a job, I'll give you
some good, I'll give you a bed.

481
00:34:24,826 --> 00:34:27,328
- Whatever you need.
- That's right!

482
00:34:27,329 --> 00:34:31,432
And we could live our
lives, friend. Truly live.

483
00:34:31,433 --> 00:34:34,335
There is definitely a
sense of togetherness,

484
00:34:34,336 --> 00:34:38,105
but I do wonder if this isolation
is the only way to achieve that.

485
00:34:38,106 --> 00:34:43,422
Well, I had hoped not, but I believe
for the time being that's so.

486
00:34:43,944 --> 00:34:48,349
You see, we built this
congregation over many years.

487
00:34:48,350 --> 00:34:52,453
We travel around and preach a
good word, wherever we went.

488
00:34:52,454 --> 00:34:57,992
And every stop we made we'd pick up
one or two of God's lost children.

489
00:34:57,993 --> 00:34:59,994
You know what we found
more often than not?

490
00:34:59,995 --> 00:35:02,496
It's a struggle to
bring people together.

491
00:35:02,497 --> 00:35:06,266
America is coming
apart at the seams

492
00:35:06,267 --> 00:35:11,604
because of the way it's being
run, and the values it instills.

493
00:35:11,605 --> 00:35:13,506
Your government is failing, friend.

494
00:35:13,507 --> 00:35:18,012
Now before you call me a communist or
socialist or whatever word you use

495
00:35:18,013 --> 00:35:24,218
for somebody who tries to help this fellow
men, let me remind you of one thing,

496
00:35:24,219 --> 00:35:27,021
all the great leaders who
have tried to achieve

497
00:35:27,022 --> 00:35:30,890
what we have here were
struck down and killed.

498
00:35:30,891 --> 00:35:34,527
That's right. Malcolm X.

499
00:35:34,528 --> 00:35:36,663
Martin Luther King. Oh, my God.

500
00:35:36,664 --> 00:35:39,165
J.F.K.

501
00:35:39,166 --> 00:35:41,167
R.F.K.

502
00:35:41,168 --> 00:35:43,404
Well, I'm willing to die
for what I believe in,

503
00:35:43,405 --> 00:35:46,785
but why die fighting when
you can remove yourself

504
00:35:46,812 --> 00:35:51,312
from the fight altogether
and create something new.

505
00:35:51,812 --> 00:35:54,914
A place without violence.

506
00:35:54,915 --> 00:35:58,152
Romans Chapter 12 verse 2.

507
00:35:58,153 --> 00:36:02,555
"Do not conform any longer to
the pattern of this world,

508
00:36:02,556 --> 00:36:09,002
but be transformed by the
renewing of your mind."

509
00:36:10,898 --> 00:36:15,175
And that way you can test
and prove God's will.

510
00:36:15,768 --> 00:36:20,406
God's good and pleasing
and perfect will.

511
00:36:20,407 --> 00:36:22,342
That's what we do here, see?

512
00:36:22,343 --> 00:36:26,679
We are continuing our
cause peacefully.

513
00:36:26,680 --> 00:36:28,581
Surely you can appreciate that.

514
00:36:28,582 --> 00:36:30,416
Absolutely.

515
00:36:30,418 --> 00:36:33,586
Speaking to that point,
when we came in,

516
00:36:33,587 --> 00:36:35,955
we noticed there were
a few men with guns.

517
00:36:35,956 --> 00:36:37,790
If this is a pacifist community,

518
00:36:37,792 --> 00:36:41,929
and it seems as if
it is, why the guns?

519
00:36:41,930 --> 00:36:45,272
Is there some paranoia
about the outside world?

520
00:36:45,865 --> 00:36:47,734
Today a woman even
called us outsiders.

521
00:36:47,735 --> 00:36:51,572
Oh. You see, this is why
I don't like the media.

522
00:36:54,576 --> 00:36:56,210
We have been speaking five minutes

523
00:36:56,211 --> 00:36:59,712
and you're already looking for
some negative angle to explore.

524
00:36:59,713 --> 00:37:03,217
Oh, no, I don't blame you,
Sam. It's not your fault.

525
00:37:03,218 --> 00:37:04,884
You don't even know
you're doing it.

526
00:37:04,885 --> 00:37:06,954
It's just the way you've
been conditioned.

527
00:37:06,955 --> 00:37:10,491
Come in here from a
sick, violent society,

528
00:37:10,492 --> 00:37:12,960
it's only natural that
you'd be less interested

529
00:37:12,961 --> 00:37:17,630
in the beauty of our community than in
the guns we use to protect the borders.

530
00:37:17,631 --> 00:37:18,631
I wasn't saying...

531
00:37:18,632 --> 00:37:21,634
What we're doing here is radical,
Sam, there's no doubt about it.

532
00:37:21,635 --> 00:37:25,905
And it is complicated, that's why
I want to explain it to you.

533
00:37:25,906 --> 00:37:29,642
I have sympathy for your
misunderstanding. We all do.

534
00:37:29,643 --> 00:37:31,818
We all used to think just like you.

535
00:37:32,779 --> 00:37:36,783
Let me just say that there are
certain government agencies

536
00:37:36,784 --> 00:37:41,128
that have been watching me and
my congregation for many years,

537
00:37:41,788 --> 00:37:45,658
everybody knows that.
I do not keep it secret.

538
00:37:45,659 --> 00:37:47,995
But I made a promise
to these people

539
00:37:47,996 --> 00:37:52,031
that I would lead them
to a better existence

540
00:37:52,032 --> 00:37:54,341
and that includes protecting them.

541
00:37:56,170 --> 00:37:58,938
It's our home down here,
we have to preserve it.

542
00:37:58,939 --> 00:38:00,306
That's understandable.

543
00:38:00,307 --> 00:38:03,250
Yeah, see? I knew he'd catch on.

544
00:38:03,877 --> 00:38:08,681
Living in that beehive New York
City has jaded you completely.

545
00:38:08,682 --> 00:38:10,049
That's good.

546
00:38:10,050 --> 00:38:12,292
So...

547
00:38:13,187 --> 00:38:16,689
It must have cost quite a bit
of money to create all this.

548
00:38:16,690 --> 00:38:20,194
Was it just through donations all
these people's life savings?

549
00:38:20,195 --> 00:38:21,828
Oh, Sam.

550
00:38:21,829 --> 00:38:25,465
I hate you, you
phrase it like that.

551
00:38:25,466 --> 00:38:28,035
Is that what money means to you?

552
00:38:28,036 --> 00:38:29,169
A life?

553
00:38:29,170 --> 00:38:32,338
We don't worship capitalism
and materialism.

554
00:38:32,339 --> 00:38:35,074
We came down here to
live off the land.

555
00:38:35,075 --> 00:38:38,812
That's why America started,
but they don't allow it anymore.

556
00:38:38,813 --> 00:38:41,347
Yeah, if you're not paying
taxes then you go to jail.

557
00:38:41,348 --> 00:38:43,684
Exactly. That is exactly right.

558
00:38:43,685 --> 00:38:46,960
Now, Sam, let me ask you
a question if I may.

559
00:38:47,821 --> 00:38:50,857
Look around here,
look at all these people.

560
00:38:50,858 --> 00:38:56,069
Do you see anybody who looks
like they ought to go to jail?

561
00:38:59,933 --> 00:39:01,575
It doesn't look like it, no.

562
00:39:02,502 --> 00:39:05,104
That's right.

563
00:39:05,106 --> 00:39:09,576
I see you wear a ring on your finger.
You are married man, are you?

564
00:39:09,577 --> 00:39:10,611
Yes.

565
00:39:10,612 --> 00:39:13,987
Oh, that's good.
You love your wife?

566
00:39:14,881 --> 00:39:16,015
Excuse me?

567
00:39:16,016 --> 00:39:19,326
A simple question.
Do you love your wife?

568
00:39:20,087 --> 00:39:23,857
- Yes, of course.
- And you'd do anything for her.

569
00:39:23,858 --> 00:39:28,368
And what about that child
you have on the way?

570
00:39:29,596 --> 00:39:34,767
Oh, what's wrong? You seem
caught off guard by my question.

571
00:39:34,769 --> 00:39:37,945
Interesting when the shoe is
on the other foot, isn't it?

572
00:39:39,873 --> 00:39:43,377
And I suppose you were wondering how I
knew that about your wife, aren't you?

573
00:39:43,378 --> 00:39:46,113
Oh, relax, Sam. I'm just
making a point here.

574
00:39:46,114 --> 00:39:49,116
You see, I love these people here

575
00:39:49,117 --> 00:39:53,387
just as much as you love your
wife and your unborn child.

576
00:39:53,388 --> 00:39:58,224
These people,
my family, my children.

577
00:39:58,225 --> 00:40:03,271
And when you write this up for your
readers, I want you to remember that.

578
00:40:03,898 --> 00:40:07,401
And when you start to
put that spin on it,

579
00:40:07,402 --> 00:40:11,271
just know that you're
dealing with their lives,

580
00:40:11,272 --> 00:40:14,065
with those faces.

581
00:40:15,109 --> 00:40:18,845
Look at the joy on those faces.

582
00:40:18,846 --> 00:40:22,089
Remember what you're
seeing tonight, Sam.

583
00:40:23,917 --> 00:40:28,262
You have a great responsibility.
I hope you're aware.

584
00:40:30,924 --> 00:40:34,928
I am. But we don't spin things.

585
00:40:34,929 --> 00:40:36,763
We try to be honestly subjective.

586
00:40:36,764 --> 00:40:40,801
We don't have an agenda, we're just trying
to document things that are meaningful.

587
00:40:40,802 --> 00:40:44,637
Oh, yeah, that's right.
Caroline told me that.

588
00:40:44,638 --> 00:40:50,276
That's why I agreed to this interview.
You know, I don't believe in the media.

589
00:40:50,277 --> 00:40:55,315
I see it always lies
upon lies upon lies.

590
00:40:55,316 --> 00:40:58,292
Anything that'll sell more copies.

591
00:41:00,687 --> 00:41:04,164
But I look at you, Sam, and I
can tell you're different.

592
00:41:05,658 --> 00:41:07,935
I can see that you care.

593
00:41:10,063 --> 00:41:11,698
We try.

594
00:41:12,741 --> 00:41:14,641
Yes, you do.

595
00:41:17,537 --> 00:41:19,339
Well, are there anymore questions

596
00:41:19,340 --> 00:41:23,676
or can we quit all this and get on
to the celebration we got planned?

597
00:41:23,677 --> 00:41:26,346
We got a wonderful band.
I know you're gonna love him.

598
00:41:32,753 --> 00:41:34,921
- I guess we're fine.
- All right.

599
00:42:22,635 --> 00:42:28,749
Yo, so that was one of the strangest
interviews I've ever done.

600
00:42:29,776 --> 00:42:31,778
Shit. Man.

601
00:42:31,779 --> 00:42:35,782
Yeah, if you could see, I only...

602
00:42:35,783 --> 00:42:37,884
Yeah, I only got through
about a quarter

603
00:42:37,885 --> 00:42:43,623
of my questions and really I'm not sure
if any of those even got answered.

604
00:42:43,624 --> 00:42:50,163
Everything just sort of got swept up in this
weird energy and I couldn't think straight.

605
00:42:50,164 --> 00:42:53,166
He had a way about him.

606
00:42:53,167 --> 00:42:55,280
That's hard to focus.

607
00:42:55,803 --> 00:42:58,805
Well, the thing about my
wife really stunned me.

608
00:42:58,806 --> 00:43:01,441
And you were saying that
he must have heard it

609
00:43:01,442 --> 00:43:03,810
from one of the people we
talked to, which makes sense,

610
00:43:03,811 --> 00:43:08,448
but man, fuck me, it was
all just so jarring.

611
00:43:08,449 --> 00:43:11,317
All that clapping.

612
00:43:11,318 --> 00:43:14,320
I hope it wasn't worthless.

613
00:43:14,321 --> 00:43:19,159
See, they're setting up for a party

614
00:43:19,160 --> 00:43:21,661
and hopefully we can get
some better footage

615
00:43:21,662 --> 00:43:24,330
to make up for me dropping
the ball like that.

616
00:43:24,331 --> 00:43:25,906
Sorry, man.

617
00:43:29,335 --> 00:43:31,838
There's a ton of good stuff, man, I
don't think you should worry about it.

618
00:43:31,839 --> 00:43:36,816
With Patrick...

619
00:43:41,848 --> 00:43:48,121
<i>When all God's
children get together</i>

620
00:43:48,122 --> 00:43:52,459
<i>What a time, what a
time, what a time</i>

621
00:43:52,460 --> 00:43:57,630
<i>We're gonna sit down by
the banks of the river</i>

622
00:43:57,631 --> 00:44:02,309
<i>What a time, what a
time, what a time</i>

623
00:44:02,869 --> 00:44:07,740
<i>When all God's
children, get together</i>

624
00:44:07,741 --> 00:44:11,344
<i>What a time, what a
time, what a time</i>

625
00:44:11,345 --> 00:44:17,150
<i>We're gonna sit down by
the banks of the river</i>

626
00:44:17,151 --> 00:44:22,021
<i>What a time, what a
time, what a time</i>

627
00:44:22,022 --> 00:44:26,860
<i>When all God's
children, get together</i>

628
00:44:26,861 --> 00:44:30,663
<i>What a time, what a
time, what a time</i>

629
00:44:30,664 --> 00:44:36,402
<i>We're gonna sit down by
the banks of the river</i>

630
00:44:36,403 --> 00:44:40,406
<i>What a time, what a
time, what a time</i>

631
00:44:40,407 --> 00:44:42,275
<i>We're gonna have a time</i>

632
00:44:42,276 --> 00:44:43,276
<i>What a time</i>

633
00:44:43,277 --> 00:44:44,677
<i>We're gonna have a time</i>

634
00:44:44,678 --> 00:44:45,778
<i>What a time</i>

635
00:44:45,780 --> 00:44:47,046
<i>We're gonna have a time</i>

636
00:44:47,047 --> 00:44:48,047
<i>What a time</i>

637
00:44:48,048 --> 00:44:49,549
<i>We're gonna have a time</i>

638
00:44:49,550 --> 00:44:50,683
<i>What a time</i>

639
00:44:50,684 --> 00:44:52,118
<i>We're gonna have a time</i>

640
00:44:52,119 --> 00:44:53,119
<i>What a time</i>

641
00:44:53,120 --> 00:44:54,287
<i>We're gonna have a time</i>

642
00:44:54,288 --> 00:44:55,288
<i>What a time</i>

643
00:44:55,289 --> 00:44:56,556
<i>We're gonna have a time</i>

644
00:44:56,557 --> 00:44:58,765
<i>What a time</i>

645
00:45:01,294 --> 00:45:04,697
Okay, I've completely turned
the corner on this place.

646
00:45:04,698 --> 00:45:06,933
I'm a fan of this goat.

647
00:45:06,934 --> 00:45:12,572
And people seemed really psyched, party
was great even without any booze.

648
00:45:12,573 --> 00:45:14,908
I'm starting to be able to see why
people want to live like this.

649
00:45:14,909 --> 00:45:19,813
I mean, I wouldn't, but I think
I'm starting to better understand

650
00:45:19,814 --> 00:45:22,949
where they're coming from. I dig it.

651
00:45:23,784 --> 00:45:26,052
Music's actually really good.

652
00:45:26,053 --> 00:45:28,454
And I fucking hate church music.

653
00:45:28,456 --> 00:45:30,824
Yeah, he wasn't lying about that.

654
00:45:30,825 --> 00:45:34,427
Patrick's having a good
time wherever he is.

655
00:45:34,428 --> 00:45:37,664
He might not want to
come back with us.

656
00:45:37,665 --> 00:45:39,273
Oh, heads up.

657
00:45:40,834 --> 00:45:42,442
Hey, Savannah.

658
00:45:45,338 --> 00:45:47,047
You're having a good time?

659
00:45:50,176 --> 00:45:51,785
What? Is this for me?

660
00:45:53,079 --> 00:45:54,981
Thank you.

661
00:45:54,982 --> 00:45:56,723
- What is it?
- I don't know.

662
00:46:03,256 --> 00:46:05,859
What is it?

663
00:46:05,860 --> 00:46:07,333
What's it say?

664
00:46:15,001 --> 00:46:17,077
Oh, shit.

665
00:46:44,731 --> 00:46:50,043
<i>Fix me, Jesus, fix me</i>

666
00:46:50,804 --> 00:46:53,673
- Where is she?
- I don't know.

667
00:46:53,674 --> 00:46:58,151
<i>Oh, fix me</i>

668
00:47:00,046 --> 00:47:06,025
<i>Oh, fix me</i>

669
00:47:07,754 --> 00:47:14,234
<i>Oh, fix me</i>

670
00:47:15,662 --> 00:47:21,909
<i>Fix me, Jesus, fix me</i>

671
00:47:33,213 --> 00:47:36,583
And there's the guards.

672
00:47:36,584 --> 00:47:38,952
What are they doing with guns?

673
00:47:38,953 --> 00:47:41,221
I don't like this.

674
00:47:41,222 --> 00:47:43,263
We got to find Patrick.

675
00:47:51,563 --> 00:47:54,299
Patrick?

676
00:47:54,300 --> 00:47:56,075
He's not in here.

677
00:47:58,738 --> 00:48:00,713
Fuck.

678
00:48:03,109 --> 00:48:05,552
What is all this shit?

679
00:48:08,481 --> 00:48:09,482
Let's get out of here.

680
00:48:09,483 --> 00:48:12,385
Sam, hold on. Safe's open.

681
00:48:12,386 --> 00:48:15,121
It's all their passports.
Dude, I don't give a shit. Let's go.

682
00:48:15,122 --> 00:48:16,389
Leave it, man.

683
00:48:16,390 --> 00:48:17,624
Holy shit.

684
00:48:17,625 --> 00:48:20,093
- It's all their passports.
- Dude, I don't give a shit. Let's go.

685
00:48:20,094 --> 00:48:21,628
I got to get some shots of you
looking through this shit.

686
00:48:21,629 --> 00:48:23,396
Somebody's coming, Jake, come on.

687
00:48:23,397 --> 00:48:25,706
Come on.

688
00:48:27,634 --> 00:48:28,902
Can I help you guys?

689
00:48:28,903 --> 00:48:31,110
Yeah, we were just looking
for your brother.

690
00:48:33,740 --> 00:48:36,984
His room's just right
around the corner.

691
00:48:50,290 --> 00:48:52,357
Oh, he is not here right now.

692
00:48:52,358 --> 00:48:53,358
Huh?

693
00:48:53,359 --> 00:48:55,929
I completely forgot. He is busy.

694
00:48:55,930 --> 00:48:57,430
Busy doing what?

695
00:48:57,431 --> 00:49:00,531
I've been telling Allison
and Sarah about him

696
00:49:00,532 --> 00:49:04,037
And they're just so happy
that he's finally here.

697
00:49:04,038 --> 00:49:07,005
So they took him.

698
00:49:07,006 --> 00:49:09,274
Threesomes aren't
particularly Christian,

699
00:49:09,275 --> 00:49:12,045
if I'm remembering
Sunday school correctly.

700
00:49:12,046 --> 00:49:15,882
Well, we all have to sin every once in
a while as long as Father approves.

701
00:49:15,883 --> 00:49:18,151
He approved getting
your brother laid?

702
00:49:18,152 --> 00:49:20,820
One must not question
what's best for the Parish.

703
00:49:20,821 --> 00:49:22,689
How so?

704
00:49:22,690 --> 00:49:26,291
I love my brother and
I miss him so much.

705
00:49:26,292 --> 00:49:28,962
And I think that he
would be so happy here

706
00:49:28,963 --> 00:49:31,464
and we're just trying
to show him that.

707
00:49:31,465 --> 00:49:34,901
Don't you think he'd
miss New York, his job?

708
00:49:34,902 --> 00:49:36,703
He can be a photographer here.

709
00:49:36,704 --> 00:49:39,706
And he has all these ideas...
This idea about this book

710
00:49:39,707 --> 00:49:41,708
about the Parish, I
think it's brilliant.

711
00:49:41,709 --> 00:49:45,812
And my parents can support him and we're
expanding all this and we need money.

712
00:49:45,813 --> 00:49:48,580
And if Patrick stays then
we can get the money and...

713
00:49:48,581 --> 00:49:52,317
Yeah, you want your parents to send
money to help build this place out.

714
00:49:52,318 --> 00:49:55,053
It's a donation.
It's the same as you.

715
00:49:55,054 --> 00:49:57,991
It's... We just need to get
through this next phase

716
00:49:57,992 --> 00:49:59,826
and then we'll be completely fine.

717
00:49:59,827 --> 00:50:01,226
Oh, are you all right?

718
00:50:01,227 --> 00:50:03,428
Yeah. Yeah.

719
00:50:03,429 --> 00:50:06,366
Caroline, I need your assistance.

720
00:50:06,367 --> 00:50:09,175
I'm coming, Father.

721
00:50:11,504 --> 00:50:14,507
If you see Patrick, tell
him to come see us.

722
00:50:14,508 --> 00:50:15,575
Okay.

723
00:50:15,576 --> 00:50:19,112
Just relax. You're in paradise.

724
00:50:19,113 --> 00:50:21,581
You fellows seem lost.

725
00:50:21,582 --> 00:50:24,249
Do you need someone to walk
you back to your cottage?

726
00:50:24,250 --> 00:50:26,251
No. We're fine.

727
00:50:26,252 --> 00:50:27,518
You sure about that?

728
00:50:27,519 --> 00:50:30,355
You wouldn't want to walk
into the wrong place.

729
00:50:30,356 --> 00:50:31,523
Why?

730
00:50:31,524 --> 00:50:35,028
Is there something you
don't want us to see?

731
00:50:35,029 --> 00:50:39,766
It's just an expression, friend.

732
00:50:39,767 --> 00:50:43,870
It's late, you want to go poking
around other people's business,

733
00:50:43,871 --> 00:50:45,904
you go right on ahead.

734
00:50:45,905 --> 00:50:48,608
But if you put your hand
into the dog's bone,

735
00:50:48,609 --> 00:50:51,743
don't be surprised if you get bit.

736
00:50:51,744 --> 00:50:54,279
What's that supposed to mean?

737
00:50:54,280 --> 00:50:56,648
You boys have a nice evening.

738
00:50:56,649 --> 00:51:00,259
Sam, let's just drop it.

739
00:51:04,257 --> 00:51:06,466
Patrick? Sam, come on.

740
00:51:10,929 --> 00:51:12,905
Shit.

741
00:51:15,635 --> 00:51:17,070
What the fuck is going on here?

742
00:51:17,071 --> 00:51:18,403
Did he just threaten us?

743
00:51:18,404 --> 00:51:20,173
I'm not sure.

744
00:51:20,174 --> 00:51:22,508
Do you think he knows
we were in the office?

745
00:51:22,509 --> 00:51:25,011
Anyway, is Patrick's
sister hiding his files?

746
00:51:25,012 --> 00:51:27,814
I know she is not supposed to be.

747
00:51:27,815 --> 00:51:29,816
They're just using Patrick?

748
00:51:29,817 --> 00:51:30,917
I don't know.

749
00:51:30,918 --> 00:51:33,559
I don't know what's
going on anymore.

750
00:51:37,155 --> 00:51:38,825
This is too fucked up.

751
00:51:38,826 --> 00:51:40,325
These people are happy living here.

752
00:51:40,326 --> 00:51:44,171
Good for them, but I don't want to
get any more involved. I'm done.

753
00:51:44,798 --> 00:51:47,332
Also, if she's getting high
and sleeping with the guy,

754
00:51:47,333 --> 00:51:48,800
what's the point of this place?

755
00:51:48,802 --> 00:51:52,205
It's supposed to be
sober living, right?

756
00:51:52,206 --> 00:51:54,606
I mean, she looks an awful lot
like the fucked up sister

757
00:51:54,607 --> 00:51:57,183
Patrick was describing.

758
00:52:23,136 --> 00:52:27,206
Savannah? Where is she, dude?

759
00:52:27,207 --> 00:52:28,373
Where did she go?

760
00:52:28,374 --> 00:52:30,716
I don't know.

761
00:52:51,731 --> 00:52:54,499
Please, take us with you.

762
00:52:54,501 --> 00:52:55,767
What?

763
00:52:55,768 --> 00:52:57,402
You don't know what's
really going on here.

764
00:52:57,403 --> 00:52:59,539
They will kill us if they
know we were talking to you.

765
00:52:59,540 --> 00:53:00,672
Who?

766
00:53:00,673 --> 00:53:01,773
Father.

767
00:53:01,774 --> 00:53:03,775
This place is not
what it seems like.

768
00:53:03,776 --> 00:53:05,912
They hurt people who
go against the Parish.

769
00:53:05,913 --> 00:53:07,747
Please, you have to help us.

770
00:53:07,748 --> 00:53:09,182
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
What do you mean?

771
00:53:09,183 --> 00:53:11,551
They keep it secret,
but it happens.

772
00:53:11,552 --> 00:53:13,418
Father will not let us leave.
We're prisoners here.

773
00:53:13,419 --> 00:53:15,687
You are being manipulated.

774
00:53:15,688 --> 00:53:18,790
We talked with plenty other
people, they all seemed happy.

775
00:53:18,791 --> 00:53:19,926
No.

776
00:53:19,927 --> 00:53:22,794
You talked with who Father
wanted you to talk with.

777
00:53:22,796 --> 00:53:26,798
Many other people won't tell you
but they are afraid to speak out.

778
00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:29,434
You don't understand the hold
he has over a lot of them,

779
00:53:29,435 --> 00:53:32,305
they're brainwashed and don't even
know it, they'll do anything he asks.

780
00:53:32,306 --> 00:53:34,407
Your friend's sister
is one of them.

781
00:53:34,408 --> 00:53:36,808
She has done terrible things
to people who act tough.

782
00:53:36,810 --> 00:53:38,945
Savannah saw them.

783
00:53:38,946 --> 00:53:42,915
They beat my daughter, that's
why she won't speak anymore.

784
00:53:42,916 --> 00:53:45,318
Please, please, help us.

785
00:53:45,319 --> 00:53:48,720
I don't know what we can do. Our
helicopter comes in the morning,

786
00:53:48,721 --> 00:53:50,722
but it's not big enough to
carry many more people out.

787
00:53:50,723 --> 00:53:52,824
- Then just take my daughter.
- What?

788
00:53:52,826 --> 00:53:54,961
Please, don't let her die.
I beg you.

789
00:53:54,962 --> 00:53:57,230
Shh! Ssh! Somebody is coming.

790
00:53:57,231 --> 00:53:59,038
Oh, God.

791
00:54:00,433 --> 00:54:03,142
Hey, it's okay. It's okay.

792
00:54:04,469 --> 00:54:06,104
What is going on here?

793
00:54:06,105 --> 00:54:07,440
We found her wandering out here.

794
00:54:07,441 --> 00:54:10,243
We're trying to find out where
she lives. She doesn't talk much.

795
00:54:10,244 --> 00:54:12,245
- I will take her.
- Oh, it's okay. We can do it.

796
00:54:12,246 --> 00:54:15,321
I know where she lives.
I will take her.

797
00:54:17,583 --> 00:54:20,453
Where is your mother, Savannah?

798
00:54:20,454 --> 00:54:23,589
I will go tell Father.

799
00:54:23,590 --> 00:54:25,331
Let's go.

800
00:54:32,265 --> 00:54:35,767
Jesus Christ.

801
00:54:35,768 --> 00:54:37,769
Come on.

802
00:54:37,770 --> 00:54:39,845
Let's just get back inside.

803
00:54:41,340 --> 00:54:44,209
They were terrified.

804
00:54:44,210 --> 00:54:46,879
We shouldn't have let him take her.
Why the fuck did we let them take her?

805
00:54:46,880 --> 00:54:48,981
What were we supposed to do?

806
00:54:48,982 --> 00:54:51,017
We can't take anyone with us.

807
00:54:51,018 --> 00:54:52,652
We could've done something.

808
00:54:52,653 --> 00:54:54,020
Sam, it's not why we're here.

809
00:54:54,021 --> 00:54:56,489
It's not our problem.

810
00:54:56,490 --> 00:55:00,126
It's not why we make these films,
you're losing sight of things.

811
00:55:00,127 --> 00:55:03,228
We can report this when we get back,
but it's not up to us to decide

812
00:55:03,229 --> 00:55:04,796
what happens to these people.

813
00:55:04,798 --> 00:55:07,165
We're not the Red Cross.

814
00:55:07,167 --> 00:55:08,734
Did you see those scars?

815
00:55:08,735 --> 00:55:12,004
How could she let her
daughter be beaten like that?

816
00:55:12,005 --> 00:55:16,042
That's all for tonight.
It's been wonderful.

817
00:55:16,043 --> 00:55:21,914
<i>Return to your cottages and be thankful
for the joy we have in our lives.</i>

818
00:55:21,915 --> 00:55:27,519
<i>Will Wendy and the clean up crew please
meet me at the pavilion in 15 minutes?</i>

819
00:55:27,520 --> 00:55:30,129
<i>God bless you all.</i>

820
00:55:32,325 --> 00:55:34,927
Look at them just do exactly
what he tells them.

821
00:55:34,928 --> 00:55:37,303
Brainwashed.

822
00:55:41,834 --> 00:55:45,571
Look, the helicopter is gonna
be back here in 8 hours.

823
00:55:45,572 --> 00:55:49,041
Let's just pack our bags
and be ready to go,

824
00:55:49,042 --> 00:55:51,910
seems like everybody
is going to sleep.

825
00:55:51,911 --> 00:55:53,412
I don't think anything else
is gonna happen tonight.

826
00:55:53,413 --> 00:55:56,281
You know, let's just
try and get some rest

827
00:55:56,282 --> 00:55:58,851
and hopefully things
will calm down.

828
00:55:58,852 --> 00:56:02,588
But when the sun comes up,
we're gonna get Patrick,

829
00:56:02,589 --> 00:56:05,224
we're getting the hell out of here.

830
00:56:05,225 --> 00:56:07,401
What is this place?

831
00:56:45,631 --> 00:56:47,833
Well, it's officially 5 o'clock.

832
00:56:47,834 --> 00:56:51,003
So much for the greatest
night's sleep of our lives.

833
00:56:51,004 --> 00:56:53,472
Tried to go to sleep
about an hour ago.

834
00:56:53,473 --> 00:56:55,274
Whatever they're doing
in the pavilion

835
00:56:55,275 --> 00:56:59,111
seems to have stopped,
so it's been quiet.

836
00:56:59,112 --> 00:57:00,612
Oh.

837
00:57:00,613 --> 00:57:02,148
Neither of us could sleep.

838
00:57:02,149 --> 00:57:04,283
It's a weird night.

839
00:57:04,284 --> 00:57:09,655
Looks like it's finally
getting to us.

840
00:57:09,656 --> 00:57:14,660
Well, I'm actually really scared.

841
00:57:14,661 --> 00:57:19,865
It's the most scared I've
been in a long time.

842
00:57:19,866 --> 00:57:23,110
Ready to go home.

843
00:57:42,387 --> 00:57:45,057
All right, it's morning now.

844
00:57:45,058 --> 00:57:47,960
We made it through the night.

845
00:57:47,961 --> 00:57:51,897
There appears to be some kind
of group of people gathered

846
00:57:51,898 --> 00:57:54,066
outside of the pavilion.

847
00:57:54,067 --> 00:57:56,535
It's unclear what exactly
is going on over there,

848
00:57:56,536 --> 00:57:59,071
but we're gonna have to
just go find Patrick

849
00:57:59,072 --> 00:58:04,450
and start to make our way
back to the air strip.

850
00:58:16,722 --> 00:58:20,399
You see this?

851
00:58:23,228 --> 00:58:25,063
Jesus Christ.

852
00:58:25,064 --> 00:58:28,207
What the hell is going on?

853
00:58:42,881 --> 00:58:45,217
Hey, what the fuck is happening?

854
00:58:45,218 --> 00:58:46,385
Dude, what's going on?

855
00:58:46,386 --> 00:58:47,586
This has been happening
for an hour.

856
00:58:47,587 --> 00:58:51,356
These people want to leave, I started
filming 'cause I knew you'd want it.

857
00:58:51,357 --> 00:58:53,892
- I have no idea what to do.
- All these people want to leave?

858
00:58:53,893 --> 00:58:56,962
They all know we have a helicopter
coming and they want on it.

859
00:58:56,963 --> 00:58:59,031
We can't take all
these people with us.

860
00:58:59,032 --> 00:59:01,033
I told them, I keep telling
them, they won't listen.

861
00:59:01,034 --> 00:59:03,829
Caroline has been freaking out all
morning. I don't know what to do.

862
00:59:06,138 --> 00:59:07,239
Hi.

863
00:59:07,240 --> 00:59:08,774
- Is everything all right?
- Yeah, it's fine.

864
00:59:08,775 --> 00:59:12,144
We haven't had anyone
come here for over a year

865
00:59:12,145 --> 00:59:14,279
and so you guys being here is
really stressing them out.

866
00:59:14,280 --> 00:59:16,281
Okay, can I... Can
I ask you on the record

867
00:59:16,282 --> 00:59:19,651
Okay, you know just really
don't concern yourselves.

868
00:59:19,652 --> 00:59:21,987
It's fine. Everything...
This is nothing.

869
00:59:21,988 --> 00:59:23,789
Caroline, this is not nothing.
These people want to leave.

870
00:59:23,790 --> 00:59:25,390
You can't keep them here.

871
00:59:25,391 --> 00:59:27,259
Listen, you guys...
They can't leave.

872
00:59:27,260 --> 00:59:29,661
They have to stay here.
Their families are here.

873
00:59:29,662 --> 00:59:31,430
Do you want to break
up their families?

874
00:59:31,431 --> 00:59:34,166
Hey, wait a minute.
They are allowed to leave, right?

875
00:59:34,167 --> 00:59:36,301
Of course, they are.
That's not what I'm saying.

876
00:59:36,302 --> 00:59:38,804
You guys need to go to the
helicopter right now.

877
00:59:38,805 --> 00:59:42,007
Hey, Sam! Sam!

878
00:59:42,008 --> 00:59:44,409
Sam, do not get involved in this.

879
00:59:44,410 --> 00:59:46,311
What are you doing? Come on.

880
00:59:46,312 --> 00:59:47,679
Please, take her with you.

881
00:59:47,680 --> 00:59:49,815
Calm down, Wendy. No one
is taking her anywhere!

882
00:59:49,816 --> 00:59:51,817
I told you, our
helicopter is too small.

883
00:59:51,818 --> 00:59:53,318
You could take just her.

884
00:59:53,319 --> 00:59:55,153
Dude, no.

885
00:59:55,155 --> 00:59:57,456
Go ahead and get to the field,
ask how many people it can hold,

886
00:59:57,457 --> 00:59:58,824
I'll stay back here
and figure this out.

887
00:59:58,825 --> 01:00:00,025
Sam, this is crazy.

888
01:00:00,026 --> 01:00:02,461
- We can't take anybody with us.
- Just her.

889
01:00:02,462 --> 01:00:03,861
I can't leave her like this, man.

890
01:00:03,862 --> 01:00:06,465
Just get there before the pilot leaves.
Have one of the guys radio back.

891
01:00:06,466 --> 01:00:08,700
That'll work, right?

892
01:00:08,701 --> 01:00:11,103
Just don't let that
helicopter leave without us.

893
01:00:11,104 --> 01:00:13,163
Go, hurry.

894
01:00:14,207 --> 01:00:16,682
Caroline, where's the ride?

895
01:00:20,479 --> 01:00:21,813
All right.

896
01:00:21,815 --> 01:00:24,349
I'll radio back soon as
I know what we can do.

897
01:00:24,350 --> 01:00:28,327
You're sure you know, when we come
back Trust in your brother...

898
01:00:33,725 --> 01:00:36,128
It's gonna be okay. It's fine.

899
01:00:36,129 --> 01:00:37,729
We're not gonna leave
without you, okay?

900
01:00:37,730 --> 01:00:40,365
- You cannot do this.
- Back off!

901
01:00:40,366 --> 01:00:43,442
We're not gonna leave
you, I promise.

902
01:00:45,003 --> 01:00:49,383
What happened? Where is Jake?
We need to figure this out.

903
01:00:50,009 --> 01:00:53,245
- Caroline, where are you going?
- I have to get Father!

904
01:00:53,246 --> 01:00:57,249
He warned me about this, he was right
about you, he was right about all of you.

905
01:00:57,250 --> 01:00:59,251
You came here to destroy
us from within.

906
01:00:59,252 --> 01:01:01,887
I didn't want to believe it, I
fought for you to come here.

907
01:01:01,888 --> 01:01:04,389
You are not my family,
I made a big mistake.

908
01:01:04,390 --> 01:01:07,232
Stop fucking filming me.

909
01:01:26,778 --> 01:01:28,280
Hey!

910
01:01:28,281 --> 01:01:30,489
Hey!

911
01:01:32,851 --> 01:01:34,327
Hey.

912
01:01:35,120 --> 01:01:36,121
Where are the others?

913
01:01:36,122 --> 01:01:38,624
They're coming, they're coming.
How many more people can fit in this?

914
01:01:38,625 --> 01:01:40,559
No, that was not the deal.
No one else comes.

915
01:01:40,560 --> 01:01:43,226
No, it's just... It's a mom and her
daughter and my friend's sister.

916
01:01:43,227 --> 01:01:45,264
- No, I told you.
- No, she's sick. We have to help her.

917
01:01:45,265 --> 01:01:48,305
- Only the ones I bring in, no exceptions.
- Look, I don't understand, man...

918
01:02:16,728 --> 01:02:21,433
You're scaring the little
one, you're scaring her.

919
01:02:21,434 --> 01:02:24,236
Hey, Sam, look out.

920
01:02:24,237 --> 01:02:25,811
Hey...

921
01:02:38,483 --> 01:02:41,086
Take the camera.

922
01:02:41,087 --> 01:02:43,488
I want you to film this.

923
01:02:43,490 --> 01:02:44,623
It's an order.

924
01:02:44,624 --> 01:02:46,632
Yes, Father.

925
01:03:41,246 --> 01:03:43,315
Do you see him?

926
01:03:43,316 --> 01:03:46,652
Where's he?

927
01:03:46,653 --> 01:03:49,862
He's gone.

928
01:04:02,701 --> 01:04:06,546
I think I see him.

929
01:04:18,584 --> 01:04:20,185
He's gone.

930
01:04:20,186 --> 01:04:21,954
What are we doing?

931
01:04:21,955 --> 01:04:23,287
Why are we chasing him?

932
01:04:23,288 --> 01:04:24,857
It was Father's orders.

933
01:04:24,858 --> 01:04:26,692
This is the end he talked about.

934
01:04:26,693 --> 01:04:30,335
Nobody can leave here alive.

935
01:04:40,807 --> 01:04:45,811
<i>Hurry up, children, please hurry.</i>

936
01:04:45,812 --> 01:04:49,313
<i>I need you all to hear
what I have to say.</i>

937
01:04:49,314 --> 01:04:52,384
<i>Every family, every one of them,</i>

938
01:04:52,385 --> 01:04:55,387
<i>come on, we don't have much time.</i>

939
01:04:55,388 --> 01:04:59,725
<i>You must be here.</i>
<i>This concerns all of you.</i>

940
01:04:59,726 --> 01:05:02,127
<i>I need you here with me now,</i>

941
01:05:02,128 --> 01:05:06,471
<i>quickly, quickly, quickly.</i>

942
01:05:18,609 --> 01:05:20,913
Come on in.

943
01:05:20,914 --> 01:05:22,514
Everybody, come in here.

944
01:05:22,515 --> 01:05:26,118
Have a seat, please be seated.

945
01:05:26,119 --> 01:05:29,761
Everyone be seated
please, have a seat.

946
01:05:31,924 --> 01:05:38,638
I've got something to
tell you, so settle down.

947
01:05:40,532 --> 01:05:41,767
You know I love you.

948
01:05:41,768 --> 01:05:44,670
Yes, Father.

949
01:05:44,671 --> 01:05:48,540
I gave you all I had.

950
01:05:48,541 --> 01:05:53,946
But there comes a day when
the quality of your life

951
01:05:53,947 --> 01:06:00,452
matters more than the time
you've got left to live.

952
01:06:00,453 --> 01:06:03,554
Oh, the men came here

953
01:06:03,555 --> 01:06:09,962
and destroyed everything
we worked for.

954
01:06:09,963 --> 01:06:12,064
We can't let them go
back to New York.

955
01:06:12,065 --> 01:06:13,065
No.

956
01:06:13,066 --> 01:06:14,333
No.

957
01:06:14,334 --> 01:06:19,670
Because they would spread lies
about us and what we have here.

958
01:06:19,671 --> 01:06:21,305
Yes, Father.

959
01:06:21,306 --> 01:06:25,042
Then their government
would send soldiers here

960
01:06:25,043 --> 01:06:29,680
to burn our homes and take our
children and kill us all!

961
01:06:29,681 --> 01:06:31,215
No, no.

962
01:06:31,216 --> 01:06:34,486
That's right, we can't
let that happen, no!

963
01:06:34,487 --> 01:06:36,722
I will not let that happen.

964
01:06:36,723 --> 01:06:39,358
Now I didn't want
to hurt these men,

965
01:06:39,359 --> 01:06:43,060
but somebody will come looking
for them, you know they will.

966
01:06:43,061 --> 01:06:44,228
Yes, Father.

967
01:06:44,229 --> 01:06:46,198
So where do they go?

968
01:06:46,199 --> 01:06:49,868
Or where do they stay?

969
01:06:49,869 --> 01:06:53,237
This is the end for us.

970
01:06:53,238 --> 01:06:59,511
Our time has finally come.

971
01:06:59,512 --> 01:07:02,014
Oh.

972
01:07:02,015 --> 01:07:08,252
Oh, mother, precious mother,

973
01:07:10,857 --> 01:07:13,724
I'll come with you, Father.
Take me with you.

974
01:07:13,725 --> 01:07:18,896
I know you will.

975
01:07:18,897 --> 01:07:22,900
Some of you have been with
me since the beginning.

976
01:07:22,901 --> 01:07:25,636
We knew this day might come.

977
01:07:25,637 --> 01:07:32,411
We talked about it and
we planned for it.

978
01:07:32,412 --> 01:07:35,914
Some of the children have
already been given the potion.

979
01:07:35,915 --> 01:07:38,784
Oh, no.

980
01:07:38,785 --> 01:07:41,787
We don't wait to be murdered.

981
01:07:41,788 --> 01:07:44,056
We don't wait to be
struck down like dogs.

982
01:07:44,057 --> 01:07:47,993
Take your drink and lay down
your life with your family.

983
01:07:47,994 --> 01:07:50,262
If we can't live our life this way,

984
01:07:50,263 --> 01:07:54,298
what earthly life is worth living?

985
01:07:54,299 --> 01:07:57,301
This is the last
sacrament, children.

986
01:07:57,302 --> 01:08:00,571
They all know we're
not afraid to die,

987
01:08:00,572 --> 01:08:05,077
but I want us to be able
to choose our own death.

988
01:08:05,078 --> 01:08:10,147
We can go kindly and
we can go quiet.

989
01:08:10,148 --> 01:08:13,517
This is our final test.

990
01:08:13,519 --> 01:08:14,685
Oh, I love you all.

991
01:08:14,686 --> 01:08:18,589
You've been so loyal
to me all these years

992
01:08:18,590 --> 01:08:22,094
and we're gonna be together again.

993
01:08:22,095 --> 01:08:26,938
We are heading for eternal life.

994
01:09:33,231 --> 01:09:35,499
Where are they?

995
01:09:35,501 --> 01:09:37,002
They're gone.

996
01:09:37,003 --> 01:09:39,538
Please, I could still
fly us out of here.

997
01:09:39,539 --> 01:09:42,848
Please help me, help me to my seat.

998
01:09:47,279 --> 01:09:49,114
Get your friends. Hurry.

999
01:09:49,115 --> 01:09:53,159
We don't have much time. Go, go.

1000
01:09:56,420 --> 01:10:01,560
Don't struggle, no, don't struggle
with it, don't you struggle.

1001
01:10:01,561 --> 01:10:05,564
It's a bitter taste
and then it's over.

1002
01:10:05,565 --> 01:10:10,936
There's no pain,
there's no convulsions

1003
01:10:10,937 --> 01:10:14,071
and this is not suicide.

1004
01:10:14,072 --> 01:10:18,543
We are not sinners, no, we're
proving our faith here.

1005
01:10:18,544 --> 01:10:22,079
Let's offer our bodies
as a living sacrifice,

1006
01:10:22,080 --> 01:10:27,084
holy and pleasing to
the Lord, Romans 12:1.

1007
01:10:27,085 --> 01:10:32,057
We can't go back, there's
nowhere to go back to.

1008
01:10:32,058 --> 01:10:35,459
So our time is up.

1009
01:10:35,460 --> 01:10:37,094
Don't be afraid.

1010
01:10:37,095 --> 01:10:38,230
Don't be afraid.

1011
01:10:38,231 --> 01:10:41,933
It's just stepping over
to the other side.

1012
01:10:41,934 --> 01:10:44,669
That's all it is.

1013
01:10:44,670 --> 01:10:49,174
Let's show the world that
the only peace left for us

1014
01:10:49,175 --> 01:10:52,310
is in death.

1015
01:10:52,311 --> 01:10:55,814
We are going to a better place now.

1016
01:10:55,815 --> 01:10:58,115
Let's all go together.

1017
01:10:58,116 --> 01:11:02,621
It's just a little medication,
that's all it is.

1018
01:11:02,622 --> 01:11:05,690
We're just going to sleep.

1019
01:11:05,691 --> 01:11:08,492
Everybody, get a drink now
just like we rehearsed.

1020
01:11:08,493 --> 01:11:14,131
Father, no, no, look, I'm sorry but
this just don't make no sense.

1021
01:11:14,132 --> 01:11:19,104
I mean, we all worked hard here, how
are we just gonna give up like this?

1022
01:11:19,105 --> 01:11:21,840
Oh, son, we're not giving up.

1023
01:11:21,841 --> 01:11:27,979
I've never lied to you and I tell
you now they will come down here

1024
01:11:27,980 --> 01:11:32,651
with their guns and
bombs and wipe us out.

1025
01:11:32,652 --> 01:11:35,854
America's on the brink
of another war.

1026
01:11:35,855 --> 01:11:41,792
We don't deserve to die like
that, we deserve peace.

1027
01:11:41,793 --> 01:11:45,529
You all agree with that,
that's why you came down here.

1028
01:11:45,531 --> 01:11:48,341
Father.

1029
01:11:51,002 --> 01:11:57,309
We have to go, so
let's go together.

1030
01:11:57,310 --> 01:11:59,044
Out time is up.

1031
01:11:59,045 --> 01:12:02,147
Come on in, bring them in.

1032
01:12:02,148 --> 01:12:04,181
That's right, that's right.

1033
01:12:04,183 --> 01:12:07,919
Keep your dignity, son.
We're all here with you.

1034
01:12:07,920 --> 01:12:12,424
That's right, that's right,
quickly, quickly.

1035
01:12:12,425 --> 01:12:18,063
Mothers, help your children, tell
them everything is all right.

1036
01:12:18,064 --> 01:12:21,265
Go ahead and drink if you
got a drink, drink it up.

1037
01:12:21,266 --> 01:12:26,203
I tried to create a heaven
here, you know, I tried.

1038
01:12:26,205 --> 01:12:28,839
But now the time has come.

1039
01:12:28,841 --> 01:12:33,411
Step over to the other side
with our brothers and sisters,

1040
01:12:33,412 --> 01:12:37,582
where the real heaven waits.

1041
01:12:37,583 --> 01:12:44,456
Come over here, take
more of this, take more.

1042
01:12:44,457 --> 01:12:48,727
We all must take our drink.

1043
01:12:56,101 --> 01:12:58,936
Take it.

1044
01:12:58,937 --> 01:13:01,973
Take it.

1045
01:13:01,974 --> 01:13:04,449
Take it.

1046
01:13:06,077 --> 01:13:08,212
Take it.

1047
01:13:08,213 --> 01:13:10,188
Take it.

1048
01:13:10,248 --> 01:13:12,223
Take it.

1049
01:13:12,316 --> 01:13:14,292
Take it.

1050
01:13:14,886 --> 01:13:16,761
Take it.

1051
01:14:00,432 --> 01:14:04,169
Anybody who receives this,
something terrible happened here.

1052
01:14:04,170 --> 01:14:07,172
I don't know why, but
they're trying to kill us.

1053
01:14:07,173 --> 01:14:11,676
I'm just gonna keep rolling and I
hope that I get as much as possible,

1054
01:14:11,677 --> 01:14:16,122
hope that this footage
makes it out of here.

1055
01:14:19,184 --> 01:14:24,262
Whatever happens, this
story needs to be told.

1056
01:14:28,660 --> 01:14:32,671
No, no.

1057
01:15:04,229 --> 01:15:06,230
Come on.

1058
01:15:06,231 --> 01:15:08,699
- Drink this.
- No.

1059
01:15:08,700 --> 01:15:10,601
It's okay...

1060
01:15:10,602 --> 01:15:12,871
It's great, it's painless...

1061
01:15:12,872 --> 01:15:14,238
No, no!

1062
01:15:14,239 --> 01:15:15,706
Patrick, Patrick!

1063
01:15:15,707 --> 01:15:20,418
It can go this way,
it's so much easier.

1064
01:15:21,445 --> 01:15:24,749
Come on, you silly,
come on, Caroline.

1065
01:15:24,750 --> 01:15:27,018
Where's the key?

1066
01:15:27,019 --> 01:15:30,254
You need to find the key. No, no.

1067
01:15:30,255 --> 01:15:31,523
What is that?

1068
01:15:31,524 --> 01:15:33,090
What is that?

1069
01:15:33,091 --> 01:15:34,892
What is that?

1070
01:15:34,893 --> 01:15:36,727
- What did you just do?
- It's okay.

1071
01:15:36,728 --> 01:15:37,894
- What did you just do?
- Okay.

1072
01:15:37,895 --> 01:15:40,532
What did you just put in me?
What did you put in me?

1073
01:15:40,533 --> 01:15:45,369
Caroline, no, no, no, what is that?

1074
01:15:45,370 --> 01:15:47,872
Don't leave me, don't leave me.
You know I love you, I love you.

1075
01:15:47,873 --> 01:15:50,975
We got to find Jake,
I love you, I love you.

1076
01:15:50,976 --> 01:15:54,412
Caroline, no, we can still
go, we can still leave,

1077
01:15:54,413 --> 01:15:57,915
We can still go home,
think about mom and dad.

1078
01:15:57,916 --> 01:16:01,419
Think about mom and dad.

1079
01:16:01,420 --> 01:16:03,654
No, no, what is that?

1080
01:16:03,655 --> 01:16:05,289
What did you put in me?

1081
01:16:05,290 --> 01:16:06,558
What is that, Caroline?

1082
01:16:06,559 --> 01:16:08,993
What did you put in me?

1083
01:16:08,994 --> 01:16:13,564
No, no, let's get out of here.

1084
01:16:13,565 --> 01:16:15,566
What is that?

1085
01:16:15,567 --> 01:16:16,933
Shh!

1086
01:16:16,934 --> 01:16:19,904
Shh!

1087
01:16:19,905 --> 01:16:22,440
We're gonna die.
I don't want to die.

1088
01:16:22,441 --> 01:16:28,679
I don't want to die. Oh, my God.

1089
01:16:28,680 --> 01:16:32,583
Oh, my God.

1090
01:16:32,584 --> 01:16:35,152
Caroline.

1091
01:16:40,659 --> 01:16:44,502
Shh!

1092
01:16:49,600 --> 01:16:52,177
Shh.

1093
01:17:34,512 --> 01:17:38,849
<i>Calm down, everyone, calm down.</i>

1094
01:17:38,851 --> 01:17:41,085
<i>The potion works</i>

1095
01:18:06,410 --> 01:18:08,853
No, no.

1096
01:18:15,920 --> 01:18:19,690
<i>Don't let your families be
murdered by these terrorists.</i>

1097
01:18:19,691 --> 01:18:23,527
<i>This is the only remaining
way for us to go.</i>

1098
01:18:23,529 --> 01:18:25,029
<i>This is an active revolution.</i>

1099
01:18:25,030 --> 01:18:28,933
<i>We'd rather die than go
back to their way of life.</i>

1100
01:18:28,934 --> 01:18:31,535
<i>This world will see it
as just our sacrifice,</i>

1101
01:18:31,537 --> 01:18:34,639
<i>but we won't let them
take our lives, no!</i>

1102
01:18:34,640 --> 01:18:37,708
<i>We are laying down our lives.</i>

1103
01:18:37,709 --> 01:18:42,947
<i>So lie down.</i>
<i>Lie down, children.</i>

1104
01:18:42,948 --> 01:18:47,318
<i>Lie down and go to sleep.</i>

1105
01:18:47,319 --> 01:18:49,921
<i>Just go to sleep.</i>

1106
01:18:49,922 --> 01:18:51,923
<i>Sleep.</i>

1107
01:18:51,924 --> 01:18:55,326
<i>Just go to sleep.</i>

1108
01:18:55,327 --> 01:18:57,728
<i>Sleep.</i>

1109
01:18:57,729 --> 01:19:00,272
<i>Sleep.</i>

1110
01:21:10,928 --> 01:21:13,838
Where is everyone?

1111
01:21:21,072 --> 01:21:25,584
Oh, my God.

1112
01:21:26,744 --> 01:21:29,720
What happened here?

1113
01:22:06,017 --> 01:22:08,627
Andre?

1114
01:22:10,655 --> 01:22:15,426
My mother, my brother,

1115
01:22:15,427 --> 01:22:19,163
my sister, they are gone.

1116
01:22:19,164 --> 01:22:22,934
Poisoned.

1117
01:22:22,935 --> 01:22:24,669
Don't leave me.

1118
01:22:24,670 --> 01:22:26,537
Shh. Shh.

1119
01:22:26,538 --> 01:22:29,372
Are they going to heaven?

1120
01:22:29,373 --> 01:22:30,640
All right.

1121
01:22:30,641 --> 01:22:34,753
Don't leave me.
Are we going to heaven?

1122
01:22:38,049 --> 01:22:39,884
Oh, my God.

1123
01:22:39,885 --> 01:22:42,320
Fuck.

1124
01:22:42,321 --> 01:22:44,455
Sam!

1125
01:22:44,456 --> 01:22:47,299
Sam?

1126
01:23:03,809 --> 01:23:05,308
I'm not gonna let them hurt you.

1127
01:23:05,309 --> 01:23:07,845
No, no, stop, it's
okay, it's just me.

1128
01:23:07,846 --> 01:23:09,547
We need to be quiet, please.

1129
01:23:09,548 --> 01:23:10,982
Don't be afraid.

1130
01:23:10,983 --> 01:23:12,550
Oh, shit, okay.

1131
01:23:12,551 --> 01:23:15,219
They're coming, all right, come
on, quick, we got to hide.

1132
01:23:15,220 --> 01:23:16,354
Come on, get down, get down.

1133
01:23:16,355 --> 01:23:18,556
I'm not gonna let them
hurt you, I promise.

1134
01:23:18,557 --> 01:23:20,558
Sshhh, get down in there.

1135
01:23:20,559 --> 01:23:23,995
I'm not gonna let them
murder my daughter.

1136
01:23:23,996 --> 01:23:26,596
Please, they'll hear you.

1137
01:23:26,597 --> 01:23:31,736
No, don't! What are you doing?

1138
01:23:31,737 --> 01:23:33,871
It's all right.

1139
01:23:33,872 --> 01:23:36,547
It's okay, it's all right.

1140
01:23:38,609 --> 01:23:43,921
It's okay, it's all
right, it's all right.

1141
01:24:07,872 --> 01:24:12,017
Oh, shit, shit, shit.

1142
01:25:06,297 --> 01:25:09,140
Oh.

1143
01:25:25,483 --> 01:25:27,617
Caroline.

1144
01:25:27,618 --> 01:25:32,464
Where did she go?

1145
01:25:55,880 --> 01:25:58,622
Caroline?

1146
01:26:00,885 --> 01:26:02,586
Caroline? What are you doing?

1147
01:26:02,587 --> 01:26:03,853
Patrick's dead.

1148
01:26:03,854 --> 01:26:06,756
Everything that we worked so hard for,
it's all over now, I have to destroy.

1149
01:26:06,757 --> 01:26:08,893
Caroline, stop, we can still leave.

1150
01:26:08,894 --> 01:26:10,528
- And go where?
- Go home.

1151
01:26:10,529 --> 01:26:12,096
This was my home!

1152
01:26:12,097 --> 01:26:14,732
All these people they were
my family, they're all gone!

1153
01:26:14,733 --> 01:26:17,101
Don't you understand?
I have nothing left!

1154
01:26:17,102 --> 01:26:18,668
Where is Sam?

1155
01:26:18,669 --> 01:26:19,904
Father took him.

1156
01:26:19,905 --> 01:26:21,671
Took him where?

1157
01:26:21,672 --> 01:26:23,506
Caroline, don't do this!

1158
01:26:23,507 --> 01:26:25,276
You should have never come here.

1159
01:26:25,277 --> 01:26:26,776
No!

1160
01:26:41,057 --> 01:26:43,501
Sam?

1161
01:26:49,799 --> 01:26:50,935
Jake?

1162
01:26:50,936 --> 01:26:56,439
Here we are, three of us.

1163
01:26:56,440 --> 01:26:58,541
All that's left.

1164
01:26:58,543 --> 01:27:03,713
We couldn't live this way anymore
but I couldn't let him go.

1165
01:27:03,714 --> 01:27:08,953
That's right, that's right.

1166
01:27:08,954 --> 01:27:14,457
I gave them all I could and
I gave them a way out.

1167
01:27:14,458 --> 01:27:18,162
We were doing something
great down here.

1168
01:27:18,163 --> 01:27:23,440
We were gonna change the world,
this was only the beginning.

1169
01:27:25,603 --> 01:27:28,838
Why couldn't you leave us alone?

1170
01:27:28,839 --> 01:27:31,949
What harm are we doing down here?

1171
01:27:32,977 --> 01:27:34,477
We didn't do any of this.

1172
01:27:34,478 --> 01:27:36,981
You brought violence on us.

1173
01:27:36,982 --> 01:27:38,848
Are you proud of that?

1174
01:27:38,849 --> 01:27:43,119
Do you take your responsibility
for those lives?

1175
01:27:43,120 --> 01:27:47,123
If not then step on over
with the rest of us.

1176
01:27:47,124 --> 01:27:48,491
No, just stop this.

1177
01:27:48,492 --> 01:27:50,261
None of those people had to die.

1178
01:27:50,262 --> 01:27:52,363
Everybody dies, friend,

1179
01:27:52,364 --> 01:27:56,834
and greater love hath
no man than this,

1180
01:27:56,835 --> 01:28:03,641
that he laid down his
life for his friends.

1181
01:28:03,642 --> 01:28:06,977
That's how we used to
teach it to the children.

1182
01:28:06,978 --> 01:28:11,015
That's John 15:13.

1183
01:28:11,016 --> 01:28:14,118
Please.

1184
01:28:14,119 --> 01:28:18,489
I'm gonna be a father,
I have a family.

1185
01:28:18,490 --> 01:28:22,266
You don't have to do this.

1186
01:28:23,994 --> 01:28:28,866
You destroyed my family.

1187
01:28:28,867 --> 01:28:36,640
One day, you'll understand,
you'll see it for what it is.

1188
01:28:36,641 --> 01:28:38,808
I'm tired.

1189
01:28:38,809 --> 01:28:44,014
I'm so tired.

1190
01:28:44,015 --> 01:28:48,018
I gave it all I had.

1191
01:28:48,019 --> 01:28:52,022
Now it's time to go.

1192
01:28:52,023 --> 01:28:56,026
We have to show the
world we're not afraid.

1193
01:28:56,027 --> 01:28:57,560
It's our time now.

1194
01:28:57,562 --> 01:29:01,264
No, it's not our time,
we can still live.

1195
01:29:01,265 --> 01:29:05,769
Blessed is the man
who stands the test

1196
01:29:05,770 --> 01:29:08,772
for he shall receive
the crown of life

1197
01:29:08,773 --> 01:29:11,909
that God promised to
those who love him.

1198
01:29:11,910 --> 01:29:13,077
No, what are you doing?

1199
01:29:13,078 --> 01:29:14,945
Jake, he's got a gun.

1200
01:29:14,946 --> 01:29:15,946
What?

1201
01:29:15,947 --> 01:29:18,055
Hey, no. No, no, no.

1202
01:29:24,588 --> 01:29:27,931
Get the key, it's in his pocket.

1203
01:29:36,200 --> 01:29:37,968
Okay. Hold still.

1204
01:29:37,969 --> 01:29:39,603
Hold still.

1205
01:29:39,604 --> 01:29:40,870
Okay, quick, get up.

1206
01:29:40,871 --> 01:29:41,938
Get up, Sam.

1207
01:29:41,939 --> 01:29:45,082
Come on, the helicopter's waiting.
We got to go, come on.

1208
01:29:48,612 --> 01:29:49,813
Where is Patrick?

1209
01:29:49,814 --> 01:29:51,482
He is dead, everybody is dead.

1210
01:29:51,483 --> 01:29:56,487
Come on, we got to go, we got to get out
of here before that pilot leaves, hurry.

1211
01:29:57,622 --> 01:30:00,097
Sam, get down.

1212
01:30:02,760 --> 01:30:06,630
Shh.

1213
01:30:08,767 --> 01:30:11,101
Where is he?

1214
01:30:11,102 --> 01:30:15,506
He's coming towards us.

1215
01:30:15,507 --> 01:30:16,740
What do you want to do?

1216
01:30:16,741 --> 01:30:19,009
I don't know.

1217
01:30:20,912 --> 01:30:24,614
Oh, shit, he's inside the pavilion.

1218
01:30:24,615 --> 01:30:25,783
Do you want to rush him?

1219
01:30:25,784 --> 01:30:26,784
No.

1220
01:30:26,785 --> 01:30:29,420
We can't, he's too far away.

1221
01:30:42,534 --> 01:30:44,535
Get out of here. Get up, go!

1222
01:30:44,536 --> 01:30:47,805
Let's go, come on, hurry.

1223
01:30:47,806 --> 01:30:49,773
I'm burning this
place to the ground.

1224
01:30:49,774 --> 01:30:51,515
Go!
