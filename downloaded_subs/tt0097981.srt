1
00:05:55,675 --> 00:05:58,395
Sixty-eight... sixty-nine...

2
00:05:58,435 --> 00:06:00,155
seventy... seventy-one...

3
00:06:00,190 --> 00:06:01,315
Come on, will you?

4
00:06:01,355 --> 00:06:02,635
Shut up!

5
00:06:02,675 --> 00:06:03,995
You'll make me lose the count.

6
00:06:06,035 --> 00:06:07,275
Seventy-two...

7
00:06:13,395 --> 00:06:14,675
Seventy-three.

8
00:06:14,715 --> 00:06:16,795
Close enough. It's a hundred.

9
00:06:16,830 --> 00:06:17,915
Let's go.

10
00:06:19,355 --> 00:06:21,035
No, wait!

11
00:06:51,115 --> 00:06:53,235
Hey, Alice! Alice, wake up!

12
00:06:56,675 --> 00:06:57,835
Jesus.

13
00:07:46,035 --> 00:07:48,875
And as adults, we must
now prepare for a new life...

14
00:07:48,915 --> 00:07:50,435
outside
this wonderful environment...

15
00:07:50,475 --> 00:07:52,475
known as Springwood High.

16
00:07:54,275 --> 00:07:56,355
So let's blow this pop stand!

17
00:08:01,195 --> 00:08:03,675
Alice! Yvonne!

18
00:08:08,875 --> 00:08:10,475
Girl, what's wrong?
Let's see a smile.

19
00:08:10,515 --> 00:08:12,295
I had kind of a long night.

20
00:08:12,330 --> 00:08:14,040
Dan keeping you up again?

21
00:08:14,075 --> 00:08:15,475
Girl, you better put a lock
on that window.

22
00:08:16,315 --> 00:08:18,040
The Dan part was nice.

23
00:08:18,075 --> 00:08:19,635
These things are wild.
What do you think?

24
00:08:19,675 --> 00:08:20,875
You look like a nun.

25
00:08:20,915 --> 00:08:22,675
Dying to break her vows.

26
00:08:22,715 --> 00:08:24,475
Find me a man!

27
00:08:24,510 --> 00:08:25,880
Fabulous.

28
00:08:25,915 --> 00:08:27,480
Maybe I should
spell it out for you.

29
00:08:27,515 --> 00:08:29,315
Maybe God's trying to tell you
something.

30
00:08:29,355 --> 00:08:30,635
When are you gonna
run away with me?

31
00:08:30,675 --> 00:08:32,475
Next life. What's that?

32
00:08:32,515 --> 00:08:35,355
My undying love. Have some.

33
00:08:36,395 --> 00:08:38,680
Mark, give it up.
It's hopeless.

34
00:08:38,715 --> 00:08:40,555
I think I'm starting
to wear her down.

35
00:08:40,595 --> 00:08:41,715
Have a taste anyway.

36
00:08:41,755 --> 00:08:45,275
Greta! That's not what
a cover girl puts in her body!

37
00:08:45,315 --> 00:08:46,675
Shit!

38
00:08:46,715 --> 00:08:47,800
She read you.

39
00:08:47,835 --> 00:08:49,835
Ladies,
where's the party tonight?

40
00:08:50,235 --> 00:08:52,440
Why don't we go to Alice's?

41
00:08:52,475 --> 00:08:55,035
No. My dad's got this thing
about drinking in the house.

42
00:08:55,070 --> 00:08:56,155
We gotta do something.

43
00:08:56,195 --> 00:08:59,435
Guys, I got swimming practice
until six-thirty.

44
00:08:59,475 --> 00:09:00,555
So?

45
00:09:00,595 --> 00:09:04,315
They're gonna give me the key,
so I can lock up after I'm done.

46
00:09:04,350 --> 00:09:06,195
Pool party!

47
00:09:07,315 --> 00:09:08,875
Oh, damn, I gotta work tonight!

48
00:09:08,915 --> 00:09:10,955
Hey, Mark! Picture time!

49
00:09:10,995 --> 00:09:13,675
Come get immortalized...
parents and brats.

50
00:09:16,635 --> 00:09:19,355
Greta! Photo opportunity, dear!

51
00:09:20,475 --> 00:09:21,715
Damn it, they caught me.

52
00:09:21,755 --> 00:09:24,275
I have to go gnash my teeth
for the paparazzi.

53
00:09:24,835 --> 00:09:26,875
You guys go on.
I'll catch up with you later.

54
00:09:39,395 --> 00:09:42,075
-Hey, beautiful.
-Oh, Jesus, don't do that!

55
00:09:43,555 --> 00:09:45,755
Sorry. I got a present for you.

56
00:09:47,395 --> 00:09:48,915
You got the tickets?

57
00:09:48,955 --> 00:09:50,755
Yeah. They're coach seats...

58
00:09:50,795 --> 00:09:52,795
but this plane stops in Paris.

59
00:09:52,830 --> 00:09:54,795
It's gonna be a great summer.

60
00:09:55,395 --> 00:09:56,515
Yeah, I know.

61
00:09:57,435 --> 00:09:59,955
Hey... what's the matter?

62
00:09:59,995 --> 00:10:01,275
Nothing. It's just...

63
00:10:02,115 --> 00:10:04,955
I didn't see my dad
at the ceremony.

64
00:10:04,995 --> 00:10:06,115
Well, he'll show up.

65
00:10:07,435 --> 00:10:08,515
Hey, come on.

66
00:10:08,555 --> 00:10:10,075
What's really wrong?

67
00:10:11,075 --> 00:10:12,995
I had one of those dreams
last night.

68
00:10:14,755 --> 00:10:16,235
About him?

69
00:10:16,275 --> 00:10:18,835
Well, not exactly.

70
00:10:18,875 --> 00:10:22,995
It's that I just felt like
I wasn't in control...

71
00:10:23,035 --> 00:10:25,115
for the first time
since all that.

72
00:10:26,675 --> 00:10:31,195
Look, if you don't dream him up,
he can't hurt you or us.

73
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:32,315
Remember?

74
00:10:32,355 --> 00:10:33,955
You're right.

75
00:10:33,995 --> 00:10:36,035
There you go. Love you.

76
00:10:36,075 --> 00:10:38,155
-I love you.
-Hey, Danny! Dan!

77
00:10:39,715 --> 00:10:41,395
You look sweet today.

78
00:10:41,435 --> 00:10:42,995
Hello, darling.

79
00:10:43,035 --> 00:10:45,915
Dan, this is Coach Ostrow.
He's interviewing next week.

80
00:10:45,955 --> 00:10:47,395
Finest quarterback in the state.

81
00:10:47,435 --> 00:10:48,600
You know what they say...

82
00:10:48,635 --> 00:10:51,035
this boy
feels the need for speed.

83
00:10:51,515 --> 00:10:52,675
So I've heard.

84
00:10:53,275 --> 00:10:55,795
Dad, could we
get into this later?

85
00:10:55,835 --> 00:10:57,555
Summer's just starting.

86
00:10:57,595 --> 00:11:00,075
Dan, we're talking about
your future here.

87
00:11:00,115 --> 00:11:02,275
Excuse us, dear.

88
00:11:02,315 --> 00:11:04,595
-Listen.
-It's OK, Dan.

89
00:11:04,635 --> 00:11:06,195
We take care of our boys.

90
00:11:08,915 --> 00:11:10,075
Say "cheese. "

91
00:11:13,715 --> 00:11:15,555
'Congratulations, Alice.

92
00:11:15,955 --> 00:11:17,315
'You looked beautiful
up there. "

93
00:11:18,155 --> 00:11:20,115
'I'm so proud of you.

94
00:11:20,155 --> 00:11:21,355
'Gee, thanks, Dad. "

95
00:11:21,395 --> 00:11:22,755
You do look beautiful.

96
00:11:24,755 --> 00:11:26,915
I was afraid you weren't coming.

97
00:11:26,955 --> 00:11:29,315
I watched
from behind the stands.

98
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:30,835
I didn't want to embarrass you.

99
00:11:30,875 --> 00:11:33,235
'The drunk showed up. "
That kind of thing.

100
00:11:33,275 --> 00:11:34,840
That's in the past.

101
00:11:34,875 --> 00:11:36,515
Unless you've stopped going
to your meetings.

102
00:11:36,555 --> 00:11:38,955
No. A deal's a deal.

103
00:11:39,795 --> 00:11:40,915
Come on.

104
00:11:43,755 --> 00:11:45,275
Where are we going?

105
00:11:45,315 --> 00:11:48,155
Oh... to take a picture.

106
00:11:48,195 --> 00:11:50,115
I don't take good pictures.

107
00:12:19,595 --> 00:12:21,155
Call me
when your shift ends, OK?

108
00:12:22,915 --> 00:12:24,035
Good-bye, sir.

109
00:12:25,515 --> 00:12:28,355
Don't worry.
I'll have her home by August.

110
00:12:30,115 --> 00:12:31,235
Just kidding.

111
00:12:31,915 --> 00:12:33,035
See you later.

112
00:12:34,075 --> 00:12:35,275
Thanks for everything, Dad.

113
00:12:35,995 --> 00:12:37,315
You sure you don't want
a ride to work?

114
00:12:37,350 --> 00:12:39,715
No. It's just across the park.

115
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:40,835
Have fun tonight.

116
00:12:53,395 --> 00:12:54,635
Oh, sorry!

117
00:12:56,715 --> 00:12:59,875
Freddy's coming for you

118
00:12:59,910 --> 00:13:01,755
Three, four

119
00:13:01,795 --> 00:13:04,835
Better lock your door

120
00:13:04,875 --> 00:13:06,880
Five, six

121
00:13:06,915 --> 00:13:09,915
Grab your crucifix

122
00:13:09,955 --> 00:13:11,795
Seven, eight

123
00:13:11,835 --> 00:13:13,995
Better stay up late

124
00:13:42,475 --> 00:13:44,160
Seven, eight

125
00:13:44,195 --> 00:13:46,515
Better stay awake

126
00:13:46,555 --> 00:13:47,995
Nine, ten

127
00:13:48,035 --> 00:13:50,395
He's back again

128
00:14:16,355 --> 00:14:17,635
Wait!

129
00:16:01,075 --> 00:16:04,195
Let me go! Let me go!

130
00:16:08,675 --> 00:16:11,035
There's nothing to be afraid of.

131
00:16:11,075 --> 00:16:13,315
Just do exactly what I say.

132
00:16:26,795 --> 00:16:27,915
Help me!

133
00:16:28,635 --> 00:16:30,035
Why is this happening again?

134
00:16:30,075 --> 00:16:31,915
Oh, please don't let him
do this!

135
00:16:33,555 --> 00:16:34,795
Don't panic, Amanda.

136
00:16:35,395 --> 00:16:36,915
We have a breech birth here.

137
00:16:36,955 --> 00:16:38,195
It's backward!

138
00:16:39,395 --> 00:16:41,315
We're going to have
to turn it around.

139
00:16:41,955 --> 00:16:43,195
Take a deep breath.

140
00:16:44,475 --> 00:16:46,835
I'm going to need you to push.
Now push!

141
00:16:55,515 --> 00:16:56,795
Holy shit.

142
00:16:57,875 --> 00:16:58,995
What is it?

143
00:17:00,835 --> 00:17:01,955
Careful!

144
00:17:02,595 --> 00:17:06,435
Sister,
this is one of God's creatures.

145
00:17:06,475 --> 00:17:07,995
Take solace in that.

146
00:17:08,035 --> 00:17:09,875
That is no creature of God!

147
00:17:11,195 --> 00:17:12,715
Stop it! Give it to me!

148
00:17:13,315 --> 00:17:14,475
Don't let it get away!

149
00:18:07,515 --> 00:18:08,875
Where are you?

150
00:18:15,035 --> 00:18:18,475
No! Not again!

151
00:20:10,875 --> 00:20:13,995
It's a boy!

152
00:20:17,795 --> 00:20:19,915
You can't come back!

153
00:20:24,395 --> 00:20:25,915
I locked the door on you.

154
00:20:30,475 --> 00:20:32,555
Well, I found the key!

155
00:20:37,035 --> 00:20:40,435
Your birth was a curse
on the whole of humanity.

156
00:20:42,475 --> 00:20:44,875
I will not allow it
to happen again.

157
00:20:44,915 --> 00:20:47,035
You brought me back
to give you life...

158
00:20:47,075 --> 00:20:49,635
but now I must take yours.

159
00:20:50,475 --> 00:20:52,115
We'll see, bitch.

160
00:20:52,875 --> 00:20:55,315
We'll just see.

161
00:20:56,195 --> 00:20:58,315
I must be released
from my earthly prison.

162
00:20:58,355 --> 00:20:59,395
How?

163
00:21:00,755 --> 00:21:02,555
Look for me in the tower.

164
00:21:03,395 --> 00:21:06,155
You'll never find her.

165
00:21:25,315 --> 00:21:26,875
Anne.

166
00:21:26,915 --> 00:21:28,635
Oh, God, I'm glad it's you.

167
00:21:28,675 --> 00:21:29,915
-It was terrible.
-What happened?

168
00:21:29,955 --> 00:21:31,475
I was in the dream...

169
00:21:31,515 --> 00:21:33,995
and I don't know how,
but now he's back.

170
00:21:34,795 --> 00:21:38,155
I thought you were dead.
You're four hours late.

171
00:21:38,955 --> 00:21:40,075
Four hours?

172
00:21:42,075 --> 00:21:45,515
I wish I had a prescription
for whatever it is you're on.

173
00:21:45,550 --> 00:21:46,715
What?

174
00:21:46,755 --> 00:21:49,675
Listen, thanks a lot, Alice,
for nada.

175
00:22:01,995 --> 00:22:03,275
Bombs away!

176
00:22:24,195 --> 00:22:26,155
What'd your dad say about
you and Alice going to Europe?

177
00:22:26,955 --> 00:22:28,195
Nothing, really.
Just screamed a lot...

178
00:22:28,235 --> 00:22:30,795
and tried to convince me
that I'm throwing my life away.

179
00:22:30,835 --> 00:22:32,115
Who's throwing their life away?

180
00:22:32,155 --> 00:22:34,275
Dan, and he's taking Alice
with him.

181
00:22:35,075 --> 00:22:37,295
Pretty good dive, Yvonne.
You've been practicing.

182
00:22:37,330 --> 00:22:39,515
That's right. Two hours a day,
six days a week.

183
00:22:39,555 --> 00:22:41,035
Have another one.
I think you need it.

184
00:22:41,075 --> 00:22:42,155
No. I got a shift
in a couple of hours.

185
00:22:42,195 --> 00:22:43,715
Aren't you going in?

186
00:22:43,755 --> 00:22:47,595
No. My mom's got this asshole
photographer coming over...

187
00:22:47,635 --> 00:22:49,795
and I'm not supposed
to mess up my hair.

188
00:22:50,075 --> 00:22:52,715
Aren't you sick of your mom
trying to run your life?

189
00:22:55,435 --> 00:22:56,775
Don't let 'em.

190
00:22:56,810 --> 00:22:58,115
Sure, no problem.

191
00:22:58,155 --> 00:22:59,240
You know, he's right.

192
00:22:59,275 --> 00:23:01,915
Sometimes I feel like I'm living
with Melicertes.

193
00:23:01,955 --> 00:23:03,475
-Who?
-Melicertes.

194
00:23:03,515 --> 00:23:05,715
He's this ancient guy
I read about, right?

195
00:23:05,755 --> 00:23:07,635
Who, like, killed his kids...

196
00:23:07,675 --> 00:23:10,195
because he didn't like the way
they were running the kingdom.

197
00:23:10,235 --> 00:23:11,835
You're really weird,
you know that?

198
00:23:14,275 --> 00:23:15,675
Screw 'em!

199
00:23:15,715 --> 00:23:17,835
Open the champagne!
Let's have a party!

200
00:23:17,870 --> 00:23:18,955
-All right!
-All right!

201
00:23:18,995 --> 00:23:20,995
That's for Alice and me later.

202
00:23:21,635 --> 00:23:23,195
Sorry.

203
00:23:24,235 --> 00:23:26,275
-Ow, are you OK?
-Oh, my God.

204
00:23:27,275 --> 00:23:29,915
I could have gone all night
without looking at that.

205
00:23:29,955 --> 00:23:32,395
I think it's very strange
how you draw all your comics...

206
00:23:32,435 --> 00:23:34,155
loaded with blood and guts.

207
00:23:34,635 --> 00:23:36,115
That freaks you out.

208
00:23:37,035 --> 00:23:38,595
Yeah,
it's just a little blood, guy.

209
00:23:38,635 --> 00:23:41,275
I know what it is,
you big, dumb jock.

210
00:23:43,595 --> 00:23:45,355
Dan, telephone. Come on.

211
00:23:46,315 --> 00:23:48,395
I'll be right back.
Don't touch this, OK?

212
00:23:48,430 --> 00:23:50,355
OK, we'll guard it
with our lives.

213
00:23:52,995 --> 00:23:55,515
-Dan, it was Krueger.
-What?

214
00:23:55,555 --> 00:23:56,795
It happened while I was awake.

215
00:23:56,835 --> 00:23:58,235
Do you understand
what I'm saying?

216
00:23:58,275 --> 00:23:59,635
Now, wait a second. How could...

217
00:23:59,675 --> 00:24:01,875
He must have dreamt himself up.
I don't know.

218
00:24:02,635 --> 00:24:04,115
Jesus, Dan, I'm scared.

219
00:24:04,675 --> 00:24:06,795
All right. Stay right there.
I'm on my way.

220
00:24:06,830 --> 00:24:08,052
OK, I will.

221
00:24:08,087 --> 00:24:09,275
Just hurry, OK?

222
00:24:15,995 --> 00:24:17,115
Shit.

223
00:24:20,195 --> 00:24:21,755
What happened? Somebody die?

224
00:24:23,115 --> 00:24:24,395
Nah. I got to go.

225
00:24:24,435 --> 00:24:25,555
Alice beckons.

226
00:24:25,595 --> 00:24:28,235
Hey, Romeo,
forgot the secret ingredient.

227
00:24:29,715 --> 00:24:32,915
There he goes,
the fastest man on three legs.

228
00:24:42,035 --> 00:24:44,680
The sounds of Springwood.

229
00:24:44,715 --> 00:24:46,955
It's a beautiful evening
here in downtown Springwood...

230
00:24:46,995 --> 00:24:49,835
and we'll be back
with the music in just a moment.

231
00:24:50,515 --> 00:24:53,395
Right now,
we're open for your calls.

232
00:24:55,395 --> 00:24:58,035
I'm calling about
my wayward ex-son Daniel...

233
00:24:58,070 --> 00:25:00,675
who's been acting
like an ungrateful dickweed...

234
00:25:00,715 --> 00:25:03,595
ever since he was seduced
by that bimbo slut whore Alice!

235
00:25:03,635 --> 00:25:05,155
Mom?

236
00:25:05,195 --> 00:25:06,955
If I were you, lady...

237
00:25:06,995 --> 00:25:09,595
I'd kill the ungrateful piggy.

238
00:25:19,795 --> 00:25:22,315
Put your pedal
to the metal, Dan!

239
00:25:43,595 --> 00:25:45,515
Bad year, Dan!

240
00:26:00,635 --> 00:26:03,075
Better buckle up, dear!

241
00:27:16,195 --> 00:27:18,835
This boy
feels the need for speed.

242
00:27:21,795 --> 00:27:23,195
Gotcha!

243
00:27:31,315 --> 00:27:34,515
Fuel injection!

244
00:27:36,715 --> 00:27:39,315
Power drive!

245
00:27:39,355 --> 00:27:41,795
Fast lane!

246
00:27:52,395 --> 00:27:55,595
Hey, Danny,
better not dream and drive.

247
00:28:01,395 --> 00:28:02,475
Coffee, please?

248
00:28:33,715 --> 00:28:35,755
He just came fucking
flying out of nowhere!

249
00:28:35,795 --> 00:28:37,555
It was some kind
of a frigging jet!

250
00:28:37,590 --> 00:28:39,355
I didn't even see him!

251
00:28:49,955 --> 00:28:51,315
Want to make babies?

252
00:29:06,515 --> 00:29:07,555
You're all right.

253
00:29:08,315 --> 00:29:10,035
It's OK, honey, I'm right here.

254
00:29:13,795 --> 00:29:15,475
Dan's been in an accident.

255
00:29:15,515 --> 00:29:17,435
It was no accident.
It was Krueger.

256
00:29:17,475 --> 00:29:19,555
He used to come in through
my dreams and not anymore.

257
00:29:19,595 --> 00:29:21,235
He found some other way.

258
00:29:25,715 --> 00:29:27,435
I'm sorry.

259
00:29:27,475 --> 00:29:28,715
It was no dream.

260
00:29:32,075 --> 00:29:33,675
Dan's dead.

261
00:29:36,915 --> 00:29:38,515
Not Dan.

262
00:29:43,635 --> 00:29:44,955
Honey.

263
00:29:44,995 --> 00:29:46,155
I'm so sorry.

264
00:29:46,195 --> 00:29:48,635
Daddy, it wasn't an accident.
Krueger killed Dan.

265
00:29:48,675 --> 00:29:51,120
Calm down. Take it easy.
You're in shock.

266
00:29:51,155 --> 00:29:53,875
The police found fragments
of a champagne bottle.

267
00:29:53,910 --> 00:29:56,755
Dan didn't drink. You know that.

268
00:29:56,795 --> 00:29:59,715
I mean, it was probably for me
to celebrate our trip!

269
00:29:59,755 --> 00:30:01,835
We gotta do something!

270
00:30:01,875 --> 00:30:03,755
Dan's already dead.
Don't you see?

271
00:30:03,795 --> 00:30:05,155
It's starting again.

272
00:30:05,195 --> 00:30:08,915
These sorts of outbursts
aren't entirely uncommon.

273
00:30:08,955 --> 00:30:10,755
Many women
have them at the beginning.

274
00:30:10,795 --> 00:30:13,155
Especially if they've suffered
a traumatic shock.

275
00:30:15,235 --> 00:30:18,435
Don't worry, young lady.
You're gonna be fine.

276
00:30:18,475 --> 00:30:19,715
What do you mean?

277
00:30:22,515 --> 00:30:24,355
What's he talking about?

278
00:30:29,395 --> 00:30:30,915
What's wrong with me?

279
00:30:32,115 --> 00:30:33,395
Nothing.

280
00:30:36,915 --> 00:30:38,315
You're just a little pregnant.

281
00:30:42,835 --> 00:30:44,755
The doctor
wants to keep you overnight.

282
00:30:46,155 --> 00:30:48,355
Just for routine observation...

283
00:30:49,275 --> 00:30:51,635
to make sure you're
as comfortable as possible.

284
00:30:52,595 --> 00:30:54,275
You're gonna be fine, honey.

285
00:30:54,315 --> 00:30:56,275
Everything's gonna be OK.

286
00:31:45,835 --> 00:31:46,955
What's your name?

287
00:31:47,875 --> 00:31:49,035
Jacob.

288
00:31:50,275 --> 00:31:52,955
Really?
I've always loved that name.

289
00:31:57,395 --> 00:31:58,955
Shouldn't you be in your room,
Jacob?

290
00:32:01,635 --> 00:32:03,195
It's lonely there.

291
00:32:06,275 --> 00:32:07,355
Well, my name is...

292
00:32:07,395 --> 00:32:09,395
I'm sorry your boyfriend
got killed.

293
00:32:11,995 --> 00:32:13,115
How did you know that?

294
00:32:13,715 --> 00:32:15,760
I could tell you were sad.

295
00:32:15,795 --> 00:32:18,035
I just wanted to see
if you were all right.

296
00:32:24,035 --> 00:32:25,515
Jacob, wait. Don't go.

297
00:32:54,515 --> 00:32:55,595
Greta, dear...

298
00:32:55,635 --> 00:32:58,115
it's time
to get your beauty sleep.

299
00:32:59,755 --> 00:33:02,915
We don't want circles
under those beautiful eyes.

300
00:33:11,635 --> 00:33:13,915
Have you visited that little boy
on my floor?

301
00:33:13,955 --> 00:33:15,075
You know, Jacob?

302
00:33:15,835 --> 00:33:18,435
He has kind of sad eyes.

303
00:33:18,475 --> 00:33:20,395
There aren't
any little boys on your floor.

304
00:33:21,235 --> 00:33:23,675
He must have wandered in
from the children's ward.

305
00:33:23,715 --> 00:33:25,275
I was just wondering
what's wrong with him.

306
00:33:25,315 --> 00:33:26,835
We don't have a children's ward.

307
00:33:27,795 --> 00:33:30,635
He was wearing a hospital robe.

308
00:33:30,675 --> 00:33:32,075
I don't know what to tell you.

309
00:33:34,835 --> 00:33:36,235
Did you call everyone?

310
00:33:36,275 --> 00:33:37,555
Yup. Listen...

311
00:33:39,115 --> 00:33:41,395
let's keep this dream stuff
between you and me, OK?

312
00:33:48,195 --> 00:33:49,795
Amanda Krueger
was part of a religious order...

313
00:33:49,835 --> 00:33:52,195
that ran that asylum
in the 1940s.

314
00:33:52,275 --> 00:33:55,315
She was raped by the lunatics
and had the baby there.

315
00:33:56,075 --> 00:33:58,675
That baby grew up to be
Freddy Krueger...

316
00:33:58,715 --> 00:34:01,075
who murdered
twenty or thirty kids...

317
00:34:01,155 --> 00:34:02,515
right here on Elm Street.

318
00:34:03,155 --> 00:34:04,235
He got caught...

319
00:34:04,275 --> 00:34:07,315
but the courts cut him loose
on a technicality.

320
00:34:07,355 --> 00:34:09,235
So, the parents
of the murdered kids...

321
00:34:09,275 --> 00:34:11,755
got together and killed him.

322
00:34:12,915 --> 00:34:14,075
Torched him.

323
00:34:15,635 --> 00:34:17,875
But that was just the beginning.

324
00:34:17,910 --> 00:34:19,635
He keeps on killing...

325
00:34:20,515 --> 00:34:23,235
but he kills people
in their dreams...

326
00:34:23,275 --> 00:34:24,795
their nightmares.

327
00:34:25,875 --> 00:34:28,115
He uses my dreams
to bring him his victims.

328
00:34:29,235 --> 00:34:31,315
It's my fault that Dan's dead.

329
00:34:31,355 --> 00:34:33,315
Stop saying that.
That's bullshit.

330
00:34:34,035 --> 00:34:35,515
Let's talk about the baby.

331
00:34:36,235 --> 00:34:37,995
Yeah, congratulations.

332
00:34:38,675 --> 00:34:39,875
I guess.

333
00:34:39,915 --> 00:34:41,955
That's not what we're here for.

334
00:34:41,995 --> 00:34:44,235
Look, Dan's parents
were really pushing him hard.

335
00:34:44,275 --> 00:34:46,155
He was bitching about it
last night at the party.

336
00:34:46,195 --> 00:34:47,995
He was under
a lot of pressure. We all are.

337
00:34:48,035 --> 00:34:49,575
Pushy parents
can drive you nuts.

338
00:34:49,610 --> 00:34:51,115
What does that
have to do with it?

339
00:34:51,155 --> 00:34:53,635
When Dan died,
you weren't even asleep.

340
00:34:54,195 --> 00:34:56,835
You even said so. End of story.

341
00:35:03,715 --> 00:35:05,355
He must have found
some other way.

342
00:35:08,395 --> 00:35:09,635
Listen to me!

343
00:35:09,675 --> 00:35:12,235
This isn't some kind of joke!

344
00:35:12,275 --> 00:35:14,595
He gets in
through my dreams somehow...

345
00:35:14,635 --> 00:35:16,035
and I thought
I could control it...

346
00:35:16,115 --> 00:35:17,595
but something's changed...

347
00:35:17,635 --> 00:35:20,215
and I don't know
what he'll do next.

348
00:35:20,250 --> 00:35:22,795
Look, Alice,
we all know you're upset.

349
00:35:23,715 --> 00:35:25,435
The bottom line, Alice...

350
00:35:25,475 --> 00:35:26,875
if anybody's
trying to hurt you...

351
00:35:26,915 --> 00:35:28,275
supernatural or not...

352
00:35:28,315 --> 00:35:30,035
they're going to have
to go through us first.

353
00:35:30,070 --> 00:35:32,115
All of us. Right?

354
00:35:35,995 --> 00:35:37,555
That's what I'm afraid of.

355
00:36:01,755 --> 00:36:03,475
How was the meeting?

356
00:36:03,515 --> 00:36:05,315
-Sobering.
-Very funny.

357
00:36:07,995 --> 00:36:09,955
When did you become
such a smart shopper?

358
00:36:11,195 --> 00:36:14,355
Ever since my little girl
became a mom.

359
00:36:17,115 --> 00:36:18,515
You disappointed in me?

360
00:36:22,035 --> 00:36:23,355
No, I'm not.

361
00:36:27,435 --> 00:36:28,955
I sort of hope it's a boy.

362
00:36:31,555 --> 00:36:34,035
It'd be nice to hear a boy
playing in the house again.

363
00:36:37,875 --> 00:36:40,555
Just don't make a habit of it.

364
00:36:45,555 --> 00:36:46,795
It's true.

365
00:36:46,835 --> 00:36:49,915
People are always mistaking us
for sisters.

366
00:36:51,195 --> 00:36:54,275
Greta certainly has
the perfect body for modeling.

367
00:36:54,315 --> 00:36:56,675
You know,
Eileen Ford is a friend of mine.

368
00:36:57,995 --> 00:36:59,115
I told her about you.

369
00:36:59,715 --> 00:37:01,315
She's very interested.

370
00:37:01,355 --> 00:37:05,555
Greta, you're being offered
the opportunity of a lifetime.

371
00:37:05,595 --> 00:37:08,395
I think you should show
a little gratitude.

372
00:37:09,395 --> 00:37:11,755
One of my friends
died yesterday, Mother.

373
00:37:11,835 --> 00:37:14,475
Do you mind if I take
a few hours off to remember him?

374
00:37:15,515 --> 00:37:17,475
But we're having a party, dear.

375
00:37:17,515 --> 00:37:18,915
I read about him.

376
00:37:19,555 --> 00:37:21,155
Drunk or something, wasn't he?

377
00:37:21,195 --> 00:37:23,475
Oh, he was just a friend
of Greta's.

378
00:37:23,515 --> 00:37:25,315
Not someone special.

379
00:37:25,355 --> 00:37:26,755
Not someone she was seeing.

380
00:37:27,515 --> 00:37:28,835
You understand.

381
00:37:31,395 --> 00:37:33,075
No, thank you. I'm not hungry.

382
00:37:35,315 --> 00:37:37,035
Aren't you eating?

383
00:37:37,075 --> 00:37:39,355
I really don't feel up to it.

384
00:37:40,115 --> 00:37:43,195
Really, dear,
you ought to try something.

385
00:37:43,235 --> 00:37:45,395
You're the one
who's always slapping my hand...

386
00:37:45,435 --> 00:37:47,515
about my weight, Mother.

387
00:37:47,555 --> 00:37:49,555
That's why we diet, dear...

388
00:37:49,595 --> 00:37:53,355
so we can eat at social events
and not upset the other guests.

389
00:37:53,395 --> 00:37:54,475
Tell you what.

390
00:37:54,515 --> 00:37:56,755
Why don't I just eat
the whole goddamn tray...

391
00:37:56,795 --> 00:37:59,475
go throw up, and come back
for seconds, all right?

392
00:37:59,515 --> 00:38:01,755
Madam, if I may.

393
00:38:06,035 --> 00:38:07,915
Bon appétit, bitch.

394
00:38:10,355 --> 00:38:12,035
Filet de Barbie.

395
00:38:13,635 --> 00:38:16,075
Nothing but the best for Greta.

396
00:38:18,875 --> 00:38:21,475
Open wide!

397
00:38:25,475 --> 00:38:27,155
Second helping!

398
00:38:28,795 --> 00:38:30,835
Don't talk
with your mouth full, dear!

399
00:38:30,875 --> 00:38:33,515
You are what you eat!

400
00:38:43,635 --> 00:38:45,515
Poor baby.

401
00:38:45,555 --> 00:38:46,675
There.

402
00:39:16,795 --> 00:39:18,360
Dad!

403
00:39:18,395 --> 00:39:20,035
Dad, help!

404
00:39:49,395 --> 00:39:51,395
Honey? How's dinner coming?

405
00:39:57,635 --> 00:40:00,315
I can't believe
this shit is happening.

406
00:40:00,350 --> 00:40:01,755
Just hang in there, Yvonne.

407
00:40:02,635 --> 00:40:05,115
Man, I know Mark
is gonna be wigging out.

408
00:40:05,955 --> 00:40:07,575
We just got to keep tight.

409
00:40:07,610 --> 00:40:09,195
We'll get through, OK?

410
00:40:10,555 --> 00:40:12,475
I know he's back here somewhere,
girls.

411
00:40:12,555 --> 00:40:14,275
I think he's pretty upset.

412
00:40:22,875 --> 00:40:23,955
Mark, you OK?

413
00:40:23,995 --> 00:40:26,315
Fine. Just aces.

414
00:40:26,355 --> 00:40:28,115
I want to talk to you guys
about Greta.

415
00:40:28,155 --> 00:40:30,515
I'm terribly sorry,
but Greta's dead today.

416
00:40:30,555 --> 00:40:33,155
Perhaps we could interest you
in someone else.

417
00:40:33,195 --> 00:40:35,035
Look, it was an accident,
just like Dan's.

418
00:40:35,075 --> 00:40:36,355
No accident.

419
00:40:36,395 --> 00:40:38,235
I tried to warn all of you
about Krueger.

420
00:40:38,275 --> 00:40:39,355
Alice, please.

421
00:40:39,395 --> 00:40:41,755
I thought about that.

422
00:40:41,835 --> 00:40:43,955
She must have fallen asleep
while she was at the table.

423
00:40:43,995 --> 00:40:45,275
This is getting
a little sick, guys.

424
00:40:45,310 --> 00:40:46,360
Too bad.

425
00:40:46,395 --> 00:40:48,555
I don't understand
what's happening.

426
00:40:48,595 --> 00:40:50,875
Krueger has to use my dreams...

427
00:40:50,915 --> 00:40:53,115
but he got to Dan and Greta
while I was awake.

428
00:40:53,150 --> 00:40:54,395
How's he doing it?

429
00:40:54,435 --> 00:40:56,215
Why don't you two
stick to reality?

430
00:40:56,250 --> 00:40:57,995
Why don't you shut up
and let her talk?

431
00:40:58,035 --> 00:41:00,115
Two of us have died
in the past two days.

432
00:41:00,155 --> 00:41:02,635
Does that just strike you
as particularly normal?

433
00:41:02,675 --> 00:41:03,995
I'm not finished.

434
00:41:05,635 --> 00:41:07,875
I loved Greta, a lot.

435
00:41:08,635 --> 00:41:11,320
And if maybe, just maybe...

436
00:41:11,355 --> 00:41:13,755
someone or something
killed her...

437
00:41:15,315 --> 00:41:16,715
I'd like to hear about it.

438
00:41:17,595 --> 00:41:20,035
-I'm not gonna listen to this.
-Then get out!

439
00:41:20,075 --> 00:41:21,475
Come on.

440
00:41:21,555 --> 00:41:23,035
Yvonne, wait a minute.

441
00:41:23,070 --> 00:41:24,915
I'm... sorry.

442
00:41:28,235 --> 00:41:29,955
I'm an asshole, OK?

443
00:41:30,755 --> 00:41:32,915
I know I'm not dealing with this
very well...

444
00:41:33,795 --> 00:41:36,395
but it's not your fault, and...

445
00:41:37,315 --> 00:41:38,635
I'm sorry.

446
00:41:41,115 --> 00:41:42,435
It's OK.

447
00:41:44,915 --> 00:41:46,875
You stick around for a while?

448
00:41:46,915 --> 00:41:48,555
I wish I could, but...

449
00:41:50,075 --> 00:41:51,195
I got a shift tonight.

450
00:41:51,235 --> 00:41:52,875
I got to get going.

451
00:41:54,395 --> 00:41:55,875
I'll stay with you for a while,
if you want.

452
00:41:55,915 --> 00:41:57,315
Bye, you guys.

453
00:41:58,715 --> 00:41:59,875
See you.

454
00:42:02,635 --> 00:42:05,035
Do you think I'm an idiot
for being in love with her?

455
00:42:05,115 --> 00:42:06,515
Nobody thinks that.

456
00:42:11,395 --> 00:42:14,355
I know I didn't stand a chance
in hell, but...

457
00:42:14,395 --> 00:42:16,155
She cared a lot about you.

458
00:42:16,955 --> 00:42:18,475
Maybe it was her mother
who killed her...

459
00:42:18,515 --> 00:42:21,035
with all that
Polly-Perfect shit.

460
00:42:22,195 --> 00:42:23,275
It wasn't her mother.

461
00:42:23,315 --> 00:42:26,155
We have these scumbags
here on "The Hot Seat" tonight.

462
00:42:27,195 --> 00:42:28,795
The Phantom Prowler
wouldn't have been afraid...

463
00:42:28,835 --> 00:42:30,195
to tell her how he felt.

464
00:42:30,235 --> 00:42:32,475
If I only had a tenth
of his guts.

465
00:42:32,515 --> 00:42:33,795
Jesus, he's not even real...

466
00:42:33,835 --> 00:42:36,120
and he's more of a human being
than I am.

467
00:42:36,155 --> 00:42:39,195
This guy isn't one of your
comic book characters, Mark.

468
00:42:39,835 --> 00:42:42,155
He's not the Phantom Prowler.
He's for real.

469
00:42:42,835 --> 00:42:44,715
Tell me more
about this Krueger guy.

470
00:42:46,875 --> 00:42:47,995
You look tired.

471
00:42:48,755 --> 00:42:50,155
Why don't I make some coffee?

472
00:42:50,915 --> 00:42:52,315
There's a lot to tell.

473
00:44:10,675 --> 00:44:12,395
Help!

474
00:44:28,155 --> 00:44:29,515
Mark, take my hand!

475
00:44:30,315 --> 00:44:31,635
Take it!

476
00:44:46,315 --> 00:44:47,835
We got to get out of here.

477
00:44:53,195 --> 00:44:54,315
Mark, come on.

478
00:44:59,915 --> 00:45:01,355
Oh, shit.

479
00:45:22,875 --> 00:45:24,195
You don't look very well.

480
00:45:26,075 --> 00:45:27,235
Are you feeling all right?

481
00:45:28,115 --> 00:45:30,115
Been having bad dreams.

482
00:45:33,315 --> 00:45:34,995
Is this where you live, Jacob?

483
00:45:36,995 --> 00:45:38,755
Just waiting for someone.

484
00:45:40,955 --> 00:45:42,235
It's sad about Greta.

485
00:45:43,835 --> 00:45:45,315
Is that who you're waiting for?

486
00:45:47,635 --> 00:45:50,275
I don't think this is
a very nice place for you to be.

487
00:45:51,275 --> 00:45:52,995
Maybe we should go look
for your mom.

488
00:45:53,030 --> 00:45:54,715
She doesn't want me around.

489
00:45:54,755 --> 00:45:56,835
Oh, I'm sure that's not true.

490
00:45:56,875 --> 00:45:59,395
I'll bet she's very worried
about you.

491
00:45:59,435 --> 00:46:00,515
I would be.

492
00:46:00,555 --> 00:46:03,755
No, you're not! You don't even
care about being a mom.

493
00:46:03,795 --> 00:46:05,355
How come you
don't think about me?

494
00:46:05,395 --> 00:46:07,675
-Who said I... What?
-I like you.

495
00:46:07,715 --> 00:46:09,355
I want to stay with you.

496
00:46:09,395 --> 00:46:11,155
How come you don't like me?

497
00:46:11,995 --> 00:46:13,715
Who said I don't like you?

498
00:46:15,315 --> 00:46:17,315
My friend with the funny hand.

499
00:46:19,035 --> 00:46:21,355
Come on, honey.
We're gonna get out of here.

500
00:46:21,395 --> 00:46:23,995
No, I have to go now.
He's calling me.

501
00:46:24,035 --> 00:46:25,155
Jacob, wait!

502
00:46:40,595 --> 00:46:41,755
Holy shit.

503
00:46:41,795 --> 00:46:43,995
He's really real, isn't he?

504
00:46:47,915 --> 00:46:49,035
Are you OK?

505
00:46:49,915 --> 00:46:52,395
He's doing something to my baby.
I know it.

506
00:46:52,435 --> 00:46:53,795
He's trying to hurt Jacob.

507
00:46:53,835 --> 00:46:55,055
Who's Jacob?

508
00:46:55,090 --> 00:46:56,275
My baby.

509
00:46:57,035 --> 00:46:58,675
What, you named him already?

510
00:47:03,075 --> 00:47:04,235
I guess so.

511
00:47:06,355 --> 00:47:07,520
I got to get away from here.

512
00:47:07,555 --> 00:47:09,635
Someplace where Krueger
can't find him.

513
00:47:11,635 --> 00:47:12,755
Slow down.

514
00:47:13,315 --> 00:47:15,395
Now, how you gonna hide
from a guy like that, huh?

515
00:47:16,275 --> 00:47:17,435
Leave the planet?

516
00:47:18,275 --> 00:47:19,355
I don't know.

517
00:47:19,395 --> 00:47:20,515
Look...

518
00:47:21,235 --> 00:47:23,035
if you're worried
about your baby...

519
00:47:23,075 --> 00:47:25,955
call Yvonne and have the doctor
check him out.

520
00:47:26,955 --> 00:47:29,795
I'm gonna go see what else
I can find out about Krueger.

521
00:47:33,475 --> 00:47:35,435
You had me scared on the phone.
What's wrong with the baby?

522
00:47:35,475 --> 00:47:36,995
I think Krueger's
trying to do something to him.

523
00:47:37,835 --> 00:47:39,200
Alice! Honey, no.

524
00:47:39,235 --> 00:47:41,115
I love you, but you're gonna
have to get a hold of yourself.

525
00:47:41,155 --> 00:47:43,075
Mark knows I'm not crazy.

526
00:47:43,115 --> 00:47:44,795
Ask him to show you his hands.

527
00:47:45,235 --> 00:47:47,680
I think you just need
to calm down, OK?

528
00:47:47,715 --> 00:47:50,595
I can't figure out how
he's getting in when I'm awake.

529
00:47:51,995 --> 00:47:53,795
Do unborn babies dream?

530
00:47:55,875 --> 00:47:56,960
They do.

531
00:47:56,995 --> 00:47:58,355
But do us both a favor.

532
00:47:59,035 --> 00:48:00,915
Don't mention any of this
to Dr. Moore.

533
00:48:02,795 --> 00:48:05,195
I can't believe you had me
drag Dr. Moore down here...

534
00:48:05,275 --> 00:48:07,155
on a Sunday morning for this.

535
00:48:07,195 --> 00:48:08,475
I'm sorry, Yvonne.

536
00:48:08,515 --> 00:48:09,795
I thought
it was something serious.

537
00:48:10,715 --> 00:48:12,715
If this isn't serious,
I don't know what is.

538
00:48:14,275 --> 00:48:16,595
Don't dare say a word.
You're gonna get me fired.

539
00:48:18,595 --> 00:48:21,195
Dr. Moore,
do unborn babies dream?

540
00:48:23,235 --> 00:48:24,320
As the fetus develops...

541
00:48:24,355 --> 00:48:26,835
it can spend up to
seventy percent of its day...

542
00:48:26,875 --> 00:48:28,195
in a dream state.

543
00:48:29,395 --> 00:48:30,795
More as it matures.

544
00:48:32,195 --> 00:48:33,315
Will I be able to sense them?

545
00:48:34,955 --> 00:48:36,835
Is that why you're here?

546
00:48:36,875 --> 00:48:38,995
To see if your baby's
having nightmares?

547
00:48:40,035 --> 00:48:42,355
We're here to find out
everything we can, aren't we?

548
00:48:43,875 --> 00:48:45,715
Frankly, I have found
nothing about you...

549
00:48:45,755 --> 00:48:47,755
that would indicate
the necessity of ultrasound...

550
00:48:47,795 --> 00:48:49,235
at this stage
of your pregnancy.

551
00:48:50,115 --> 00:48:52,235
I just want to make sure
my baby's all right.

552
00:48:55,315 --> 00:48:57,115
Well, the heart seems strong.

553
00:48:57,915 --> 00:48:58,835
Let's hear it.

554
00:49:04,835 --> 00:49:06,595
There's your baby.

555
00:49:14,675 --> 00:49:15,795
Get her file.

556
00:50:22,995 --> 00:50:24,875
See any family resemblance?

557
00:50:31,635 --> 00:50:33,275
Feeding time.

558
00:50:34,115 --> 00:50:35,755
Soul food for my boy.

559
00:50:37,635 --> 00:50:38,795
Don't touch him!

560
00:50:43,555 --> 00:50:45,475
What's he doing to my baby?

561
00:50:45,555 --> 00:50:48,075
Please, young lady,
try to keep calm.

562
00:50:49,115 --> 00:50:51,435
Your baby is perfectly healthy.

563
00:50:51,475 --> 00:50:52,915
A little large
for so early on...

564
00:50:52,995 --> 00:50:54,835
but as normal
as I've ever seen.

565
00:50:54,875 --> 00:50:57,035
He's taking their souls,
their spirits...

566
00:50:57,075 --> 00:50:58,715
and making the baby like him.

567
00:50:58,750 --> 00:51:00,355
Look, sweetie, you're tired.

568
00:51:01,035 --> 00:51:02,515
You'll feel much better
after I take you home...

569
00:51:02,595 --> 00:51:05,155
and get some rest, OK?
Come on, let's go.

570
00:51:05,190 --> 00:51:06,315
Come on.

571
00:51:24,555 --> 00:51:26,275
Greta and Dan were there.

572
00:51:26,875 --> 00:51:28,795
Krueger killed them.

573
00:51:28,835 --> 00:51:29,995
Now he was...

574
00:51:30,955 --> 00:51:33,275
feeding them to Jacob.

575
00:51:34,995 --> 00:51:36,395
Alice,
stop and listen to yourself.

576
00:51:36,475 --> 00:51:38,315
Do you know what you sound like?

577
00:51:38,355 --> 00:51:41,600
Completely insane, but I'm not.

578
00:51:41,635 --> 00:51:45,075
And if you're my friend,
you would believe me a little.

579
00:51:45,115 --> 00:51:47,275
I am your friend,
and I'm worried sick about you.

580
00:51:47,315 --> 00:51:49,835
It's time to leave the Twilight
Zone and face reality.

581
00:51:49,875 --> 00:51:51,715
-Krueger is reality.
-So is your baby.

582
00:51:51,755 --> 00:51:53,795
You got more to think about
than yourself.

583
00:51:53,830 --> 00:51:55,355
What do you think I'm doing?

584
00:51:58,595 --> 00:51:59,795
Look...

585
00:52:00,875 --> 00:52:03,075
whether you believe it or not,
Krueger is back.

586
00:52:03,115 --> 00:52:04,235
He's after my baby...

587
00:52:04,275 --> 00:52:08,075
and if I don't try to do
something about it, who will?

588
00:52:08,155 --> 00:52:11,435
All I know is you're not doing
you or your baby any good...

589
00:52:11,475 --> 00:52:12,675
by acting like a crazy woman.

590
00:52:12,715 --> 00:52:14,440
Why don't you take off?

591
00:52:14,475 --> 00:52:16,315
Leave Springwood.
Cool off for a while.

592
00:52:16,355 --> 00:52:18,795
God damn it, you don't run away
from this guy!

593
00:52:18,835 --> 00:52:20,675
He finds you in your dreams!

594
00:52:20,715 --> 00:52:22,995
He found a lot of other people
before he found us.

595
00:52:23,835 --> 00:52:26,715
-You, too?
-He invited me to his house.

596
00:52:27,795 --> 00:52:29,000
Look, we're all tired...

597
00:52:29,035 --> 00:52:31,435
and we haven't had any sleep
since Friday night.

598
00:52:31,515 --> 00:52:32,955
That's the only reason
you're alive.

599
00:52:33,035 --> 00:52:34,715
No, it's not!

600
00:52:34,755 --> 00:52:36,155
Look through this stuff,
will you?

601
00:52:36,235 --> 00:52:37,635
She's not crazy!

602
00:52:46,955 --> 00:52:48,075
You OK?

603
00:52:49,355 --> 00:52:51,155
I know what's happening.

604
00:52:52,595 --> 00:52:55,355
Krueger's using Jacob's dreams.

605
00:52:55,395 --> 00:52:56,715
We gotta stop him.

606
00:52:59,795 --> 00:53:00,915
Well, there is...

607
00:53:01,835 --> 00:53:03,155
one way.

608
00:53:05,475 --> 00:53:07,475
Have you thought about
not having the baby?

609
00:53:08,195 --> 00:53:10,995
I mean, no baby...
no baby's dreams.

610
00:53:13,195 --> 00:53:14,795
No, I can't do that.

611
00:53:15,915 --> 00:53:17,875
I saw him inside of me, growing.

612
00:53:19,995 --> 00:53:22,275
He's part of me and Dan.
I want to keep him.

613
00:53:23,595 --> 00:53:25,515
OK, then we'll find another way.

614
00:53:31,155 --> 00:53:32,275
I've seen her.

615
00:53:35,515 --> 00:53:37,555
Alice, can you come down
a minute?

616
00:53:49,315 --> 00:53:52,355
Mr. Jordan and I wanted to see
how you're feeling.

617
00:53:54,115 --> 00:53:55,835
Well, come sit down.

618
00:53:57,355 --> 00:53:58,875
This really isn't a good time.

619
00:53:58,915 --> 00:54:00,315
Maybe you could come back.

620
00:54:00,395 --> 00:54:04,635
Frankly, we wondered what
you intend to do with your baby.

621
00:54:05,675 --> 00:54:06,875
What I what?

622
00:54:11,795 --> 00:54:15,595
Well, I've thought about it,
and I plan to keep him.

623
00:54:19,795 --> 00:54:21,595
We were concerned
that all this...

624
00:54:21,635 --> 00:54:24,035
might be a little bit too much
for you.

625
00:54:24,070 --> 00:54:26,435
I mean,
being single and everything.

626
00:54:27,755 --> 00:54:30,835
What Mr. Jordan means is that
we're aware of the burden...

627
00:54:30,875 --> 00:54:34,475
that raising a child
would place on you.

628
00:54:35,715 --> 00:54:37,480
We want to help.

629
00:54:37,515 --> 00:54:40,835
We want to adopt it and raise it
as though it were our own.

630
00:54:43,875 --> 00:54:47,155
Look, I appreciate
what you're offering...

631
00:54:47,235 --> 00:54:48,755
but, no.

632
00:54:48,795 --> 00:54:50,195
He's my responsibility.

633
00:54:50,275 --> 00:54:51,515
And ours.

634
00:54:52,235 --> 00:54:53,675
It's our grandchild.

635
00:54:53,715 --> 00:54:55,315
Now, Doris, maybe
this wasn't such a good idea.

636
00:54:55,355 --> 00:54:58,555
Alice, we're worried that
in your present condition...

637
00:54:58,595 --> 00:55:00,475
that you don't have
the ability...

638
00:55:00,555 --> 00:55:03,275
to take care of a child.

639
00:55:05,315 --> 00:55:08,635
What are you talking about,
"my condition"?

640
00:55:11,875 --> 00:55:14,675
We got a call from Dr. Moore.

641
00:55:14,715 --> 00:55:17,075
He said that
Alice was hysterical...

642
00:55:17,115 --> 00:55:20,275
and that she was having
paranoid delusions.

643
00:55:20,315 --> 00:55:22,195
You don't understand.

644
00:55:22,275 --> 00:55:23,675
We know you've been through
a lot...

645
00:55:24,955 --> 00:55:27,635
but there is more at stake here
than just your feelings.

646
00:55:27,675 --> 00:55:30,435
You're not taking my baby.

647
00:55:31,515 --> 00:55:33,195
Well, the courts
might not agree with you.

648
00:55:33,235 --> 00:55:34,555
But I do.

649
00:55:34,595 --> 00:55:36,435
I've heard enough of this crap.

650
00:55:36,475 --> 00:55:37,995
You think you can just
walk into my house...

651
00:55:38,035 --> 00:55:39,435
and threaten my daughter?

652
00:55:39,515 --> 00:55:42,515
Please, we have
a legitimate claim to it.

653
00:55:43,715 --> 00:55:45,595
He's not a thing.

654
00:55:45,635 --> 00:55:47,035
He's part of me...

655
00:55:47,075 --> 00:55:50,115
and I'm not giving him to you
or anyone else!

656
00:56:02,635 --> 00:56:04,075
They think I'm nuts.

657
00:56:04,875 --> 00:56:06,235
That's their problem.

658
00:56:06,275 --> 00:56:07,755
No, it's our problem.

659
00:56:07,795 --> 00:56:09,320
If I don't deal with this...

660
00:56:09,355 --> 00:56:11,035
they really might try
to take Jacob.

661
00:56:13,115 --> 00:56:14,440
You said she committed suicide.

662
00:56:14,475 --> 00:56:17,000
Yeah, that's what
the papers thought.

663
00:56:17,035 --> 00:56:19,275
She spent the rest of her life
in the asylum.

664
00:56:19,315 --> 00:56:21,435
After Krueger's trial,
she flipped out...

665
00:56:21,475 --> 00:56:23,755
and hung herself...
so they thought.

666
00:56:23,795 --> 00:56:24,875
Meaning?

667
00:56:24,915 --> 00:56:26,315
Meaning...

668
00:56:26,395 --> 00:56:27,715
they couldn't prove it.

669
00:56:29,075 --> 00:56:30,195
No body.

670
00:56:31,395 --> 00:56:33,035
But I've seen her grave.

671
00:56:33,070 --> 00:56:34,715
Ah, empty plot.

672
00:56:34,755 --> 00:56:36,875
A memorial stone.

673
00:56:37,635 --> 00:56:39,675
Vacant.
They never put her under.

674
00:56:39,715 --> 00:56:41,115
Cool, huh?

675
00:56:42,155 --> 00:56:43,240
I don't understand.

676
00:56:43,275 --> 00:56:48,395
If she killed herself,
her soul's gonna be in torment.

677
00:56:48,430 --> 00:56:49,675
Where'd you hear that?

678
00:56:51,875 --> 00:56:53,755
Right here, somewhere.

679
00:57:00,395 --> 00:57:03,875
Yeah. "Transmigration...

680
00:57:03,915 --> 00:57:05,915
'Soul of a sinner... "

681
00:57:05,955 --> 00:57:09,195
Yeah. "Trapped
in its earthly resting place. "

682
00:57:09,875 --> 00:57:12,515
In the dream,
she was trying to stop him.

683
00:57:12,555 --> 00:57:14,795
She started to tell me how,
then the door slammed.

684
00:57:16,635 --> 00:57:17,755
He must have done it.

685
00:57:18,635 --> 00:57:21,755
We have to find where she died
to release her soul.

686
00:57:22,395 --> 00:57:24,595
I want you to stay awake
and watch me, OK?

687
00:57:24,635 --> 00:57:25,795
No problem.

688
00:57:50,275 --> 00:57:52,155
Hey, you missed practice.

689
00:57:52,195 --> 00:57:54,875
What happened? You fall in love?

690
00:57:54,915 --> 00:57:56,235
Don't ask.

691
00:57:57,195 --> 00:57:58,635
You don't even want to know.

692
00:58:00,315 --> 00:58:02,075
Pool still open?

693
00:58:02,115 --> 00:58:03,915
I think, if you hurry.

694
01:00:45,315 --> 01:00:47,555
Let's rock...

695
01:00:47,590 --> 01:00:49,795
and roll!

696
01:01:08,795 --> 01:01:10,955
Where are you going, piglet?

697
01:01:12,875 --> 01:01:15,195
The party's just starting.

698
01:01:15,755 --> 01:01:17,915
I know
exactly what you're up to.

699
01:01:17,955 --> 01:01:22,955
I thought I was up to Yvonne!

700
01:01:27,155 --> 01:01:28,355
Why don't you just shut up?

701
01:01:46,835 --> 01:01:48,400
What happened?

702
01:01:48,435 --> 01:01:50,995
He's scared to come in
because of Amanda.

703
01:01:53,995 --> 01:01:56,075
Hey, are you all right?

704
01:01:56,115 --> 01:01:57,235
Oh, God.

705
01:01:59,355 --> 01:02:01,195
You're not crazy.

706
01:02:02,955 --> 01:02:05,515
We have to find Amanda.
She's the key.

707
01:02:05,555 --> 01:02:06,955
Come on. Come on.

708
01:02:42,395 --> 01:02:43,635
Jesus.

709
01:04:25,915 --> 01:04:29,395
Mark, help me, please!

710
01:04:31,635 --> 01:04:34,875
Is she delicious, or am I crazy?

711
01:04:34,915 --> 01:04:36,435
You leave her alone!

712
01:04:50,475 --> 01:04:54,715
Time to die,
you scar-faced limp-dick!

713
01:05:24,155 --> 01:05:26,675
Faster than a bastard maniac!

714
01:05:29,995 --> 01:05:32,115
More powerful
than a loco-madman!

715
01:05:35,675 --> 01:05:38,275
It's... Super Freddy!

716
01:05:39,235 --> 01:05:42,395
Told you comic books
was bad for ya!

717
01:06:32,195 --> 01:06:33,795
Oh, God! Oh, shit!

718
01:06:41,155 --> 01:06:42,435
Damn it!

719
01:06:42,475 --> 01:06:44,495
Nothing in that room
was up to code.

720
01:06:44,530 --> 01:06:46,515
It's a miracle
they both weren't killed.

721
01:06:47,315 --> 01:06:50,595
No! He won't hurt me.
He needs me alive.

722
01:06:50,635 --> 01:06:52,915
Who? What's she talking about?

723
01:06:52,955 --> 01:06:54,915
No, she's just very upset.

724
01:06:56,195 --> 01:06:58,515
Maybe both of you
should come down to the station.

725
01:07:06,035 --> 01:07:07,475
What's going on? Where's Mark?

726
01:07:08,915 --> 01:07:10,515
Mark fell asleep.

727
01:07:10,555 --> 01:07:12,715
Krueger got him.

728
01:07:12,755 --> 01:07:14,155
No! God!

729
01:07:14,195 --> 01:07:16,755
Hey, come on!
I need you to be strong now!

730
01:07:16,795 --> 01:07:19,475
Listen, we have to get
to Krueger...

731
01:07:19,510 --> 01:07:21,395
before he gets to Jacob again.

732
01:07:21,430 --> 01:07:23,075
How do we stop him?

733
01:07:23,915 --> 01:07:25,035
Through Amanda.

734
01:07:26,155 --> 01:07:27,955
So... we have to find her?

735
01:07:29,515 --> 01:07:32,595
Just don't ask me to take
a Jacuzzi with that guy again.

736
01:07:33,995 --> 01:07:35,075
You know...

737
01:07:35,115 --> 01:07:38,395
I was in the tower
when he used you to distract me.

738
01:07:40,715 --> 01:07:41,835
What are we gonna do?

739
01:07:42,715 --> 01:07:44,035
I want you
to go to the asylum...

740
01:07:44,075 --> 01:07:46,635
the one I told you about,
where all of this started...

741
01:07:46,675 --> 01:07:48,315
and find her!

742
01:07:48,355 --> 01:07:49,995
Alice,
you're coming home with me.

743
01:07:50,030 --> 01:07:51,600
No, Dad,
I've got something to do.

744
01:07:51,635 --> 01:07:53,595
Alice,
you're coming with me right now.

745
01:07:55,995 --> 01:07:58,795
Find Amanda! And hurry!

746
01:09:25,155 --> 01:09:26,595
Come on out, Krueger!

747
01:09:30,755 --> 01:09:32,235
The game's over!

748
01:09:48,435 --> 01:09:50,075
I was stronger than you!

749
01:09:51,355 --> 01:09:54,235
So you picked on Jacob!
You bastard!

750
01:09:55,275 --> 01:09:56,875
You're trying to make him
like you...

751
01:09:56,915 --> 01:09:59,195
so you can live
through his dreams!

752
01:10:00,115 --> 01:10:02,315
Well, I won't let you!

753
01:10:02,355 --> 01:10:04,155
You hear me, Krueger?

754
01:10:15,555 --> 01:10:18,875
OK, if you won't talk to me...

755
01:10:18,915 --> 01:10:21,035
maybe you'd like to talk
to Amanda!

756
01:11:06,235 --> 01:11:08,635
Come on, you fucking coward!

757
01:12:09,115 --> 01:12:11,315
Good night, asshole!

758
01:12:33,395 --> 01:12:35,155
I'm your real friend, Jacob.

759
01:12:35,195 --> 01:12:36,315
Just like a daddy.

760
01:12:40,955 --> 01:12:43,675
I gotcha! I gotcha!

761
01:12:43,715 --> 01:12:45,315
Mommy, meet my friend.

762
01:12:47,955 --> 01:12:50,035
Nice try, Alice.

763
01:12:50,075 --> 01:12:51,275
Thanks, babe.

764
01:12:51,315 --> 01:12:53,635
It's my new look. Like it?

765
01:13:05,595 --> 01:13:08,280
Come downstairs.

766
01:13:08,315 --> 01:13:10,035
He won't hurt you.
He needs us both.

767
01:13:10,075 --> 01:13:12,035
I've got you both.

768
01:13:13,755 --> 01:13:16,395
Come on, Jacob.
It's time to go home.

769
01:13:20,635 --> 01:13:23,515
Jacob, run!

770
01:13:29,595 --> 01:13:31,755
Come on! Come on!

771
01:13:31,795 --> 01:13:33,435
Come to Papa!

772
01:13:38,395 --> 01:13:39,995
It's all right, son.

773
01:13:43,955 --> 01:13:45,435
Now come with me.

774
01:13:48,435 --> 01:13:50,195
Jacob, he's not your father!

775
01:14:02,155 --> 01:14:03,475
Kids.

776
01:14:03,515 --> 01:14:06,195
Always a disappointment.

777
01:14:37,435 --> 01:14:38,555
Where is he?

778
01:14:39,195 --> 01:14:41,315
Inside you... where he hides.

779
01:14:41,995 --> 01:14:43,555
What do you mean?

780
01:14:43,595 --> 01:14:45,955
Where he hides out. Inside.

781
01:14:46,915 --> 01:14:48,115
That's how he found me.

782
01:14:48,155 --> 01:14:49,115
But how?

783
01:14:49,195 --> 01:14:52,955
He says it's easy
because he knows you so well.

784
01:14:58,515 --> 01:14:59,675
All right, Krueger...

785
01:15:01,115 --> 01:15:03,195
this time it's for keeps!

786
01:15:31,595 --> 01:15:33,155
Come on, Alice...

787
01:15:33,195 --> 01:15:36,155
now we can really get to know
each other.

788
01:16:04,035 --> 01:16:05,595
Sister Amanda?

789
01:16:24,035 --> 01:16:26,115
Thank you.

790
01:16:52,355 --> 01:16:54,995
Jacob! Alice will not triumph!

791
01:16:55,915 --> 01:16:58,115
Only you can help her now.

792
01:17:00,635 --> 01:17:01,875
Hey, leave her!

793
01:17:04,915 --> 01:17:07,315
Let's go!
I want to learn stuff from you.

794
01:17:07,995 --> 01:17:10,155
She's no fun anymore.

795
01:17:10,195 --> 01:17:11,555
Teach me?

796
01:17:26,595 --> 01:17:27,875
Now, Jacob.

797
01:17:28,995 --> 01:17:31,715
Unleash the power
he has given you.

798
01:17:34,595 --> 01:17:36,515
School's out, Krueger.

799
01:19:24,875 --> 01:19:25,995
Stay back!

800
01:19:26,915 --> 01:19:28,355
Take your baby and leave!

801
01:19:38,435 --> 01:19:39,555
Let me out!

802
01:20:01,475 --> 01:20:02,555
You do good work, Alice.

803
01:20:02,595 --> 01:20:03,835
So did Dan.

804
01:20:04,675 --> 01:20:06,075
Is he still keeping you up
at night?

805
01:20:06,115 --> 01:20:07,795
Oh, it's OK.

806
01:20:10,115 --> 01:20:12,675
He has the rest of his life
to catch up on his sleep.

807
01:20:14,715 --> 01:20:15,915
Hi, honey.

808
01:20:18,155 --> 01:20:20,395
Sweet dreams, Jacob Daniel.

809
01:20:21,715 --> 01:20:23,155
Hey, sugar.

810
01:20:23,915 --> 01:20:26,035
How's my little grandson, huh?

811
01:20:27,715 --> 01:20:28,795
Look.

812
01:20:29,795 --> 01:20:31,040
Hungry?

813
01:20:31,075 --> 01:20:33,475
Mm-hmm. We all are.

814
01:20:35,395 --> 01:20:37,035
Hey, sweetie.
