1
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,214
<i>A lot of the better
bowlers really--</i>

2
00:01:55,216 --> 00:01:57,483
Got another one, Dad.

3
00:01:57,485 --> 00:01:59,718
Leave it outside.

4
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:01,887
Can I get paid?

5
00:02:02,989 --> 00:02:05,390
You know
where the register is.

6
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:32,911
Mountain Vista Motel.
Why are you calling?

7
00:03:34,548 --> 00:03:37,749
One room will cost you $22.

8
00:03:38,818 --> 00:03:41,253
<i>Yes, that does
include towels.</i>

9
00:03:41,255 --> 00:03:45,924
And, um, yeah.
Towels and free heat.

10
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:13,572
<i>Mr. Parker, we had
a lean couple of months.</i>

11
00:06:15,341 --> 00:06:18,410
Well, summer's here.
High season.

12
00:06:18,412 --> 00:06:23,982
Um, you know,
a few good months and, um,

13
00:06:23,984 --> 00:06:26,818
and we'll be back on our feet
by September, I promise.

14
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:29,654
And I'll have a payment
to you by October
at the very latest.

15
00:06:33,926 --> 00:06:36,094
Mr. Parker, please.
If you could ju--

16
00:06:43,903 --> 00:06:46,772
Nice of you to call.

17
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,975
Thank you
for your understanding.

18
00:08:54,233 --> 00:08:57,235
Mm? Yeah.

19
00:08:57,970 --> 00:09:00,272
Good boy.

20
00:10:49,115 --> 00:10:50,281
I got another one!

21
00:11:00,026 --> 00:11:03,028
You--
You gonna have to
take an IOU, Ted.

22
00:11:04,263 --> 00:11:07,499
You're the only one
makin' any money here.

23
00:11:10,603 --> 00:11:15,674
Why don't you, um--
Why don't you clean up
Rooms 1 through 5 today?

24
00:11:15,676 --> 00:11:17,676
There's nobody in there!

25
00:11:17,678 --> 00:11:19,711
Don't forget
to feed the chickens.

26
00:11:19,713 --> 00:11:21,546
And don't leave
the feed bag out
this time.

27
00:11:22,381 --> 00:11:24,049
Deer keep getting in.

28
00:11:52,478 --> 00:11:54,479
This is our honeymoon suite.

29
00:11:54,481 --> 00:11:56,815
Perfect for a lovely couple
like yourselves.

30
00:12:03,656 --> 00:12:08,393
This is our honeymoon suite.
Perfect for a lovely couple
like yourselves.

31
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:13,932
Hey, Ted!
Dinner.

32
00:12:17,002 --> 00:12:18,770
Hey, Ted?

33
00:12:42,862 --> 00:12:45,463
Oh, there you are.
Grab a seat.

34
00:12:55,474 --> 00:12:59,644
Noodles and hot dogs.
Your favorite.

35
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:06,818
You know what today is?

36
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:10,488
- My birthday.
- Yeah. Yeah.

37
00:13:10,490 --> 00:13:14,092
You know how old you are?
I'm nine.

38
00:13:14,094 --> 00:13:16,828
Yeah. Hard to believe,
isn't it?

39
00:13:19,498 --> 00:13:22,033
Okay. Hold on.
Just stay right there.

40
00:13:26,839 --> 00:13:29,140
I was hopin'
to surprise you.

41
00:14:19,292 --> 00:14:22,894
Here we go.

42
00:14:30,904 --> 00:14:33,338
There.

43
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:35,240
There you are.
Turn it off!

44
00:14:36,542 --> 00:14:39,143
Oh, you loved this song.

45
00:14:39,145 --> 00:14:41,479
We used to sing it to you
every night before you--

46
00:14:42,548 --> 00:14:46,150
Ted.
Oh, come on.

47
00:14:46,152 --> 00:14:49,087
Ted.

48
00:14:52,759 --> 00:14:54,626
Te--

49
00:15:21,453 --> 00:15:23,755
Shut up!

50
00:16:30,122 --> 00:16:32,523
Come on. Come on.

51
00:17:56,175 --> 00:17:59,610
Ted! Ted!

52
00:18:44,723 --> 00:18:46,591
Get those lights.

53
00:18:46,593 --> 00:18:49,660
Okay. Here you go.

54
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:54,298
This is our honeymoon suite.

55
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:58,736
Listen. We got a--
We got a hospital
just 20 minutes from here.

56
00:18:58,738 --> 00:19:01,139
It'd be wise
if I tried to get you there.
No. I'm okay.

57
00:19:01,141 --> 00:19:03,908
I just--
I need to lie down.

58
00:19:03,910 --> 00:19:07,979
Well, look, um--
I'll get you
some more towels.

59
00:19:07,981 --> 00:19:09,981
You're gonna need those.
Come on, Ted. Now.

60
00:19:20,192 --> 00:19:22,927
Checkout's at 11:00
tomorrow.

61
00:20:11,543 --> 00:20:14,178
Did you see what happened?
No.

62
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:16,013
All right.

63
00:20:16,015 --> 00:20:20,218
Oh, that poor thing.
Why don't you stand back?

64
00:20:21,386 --> 00:20:23,554
Do you see
what I'm about to do?

65
00:20:23,556 --> 00:20:25,656
Do you understand why?

66
00:20:25,658 --> 00:20:27,592
All right?

67
00:20:29,061 --> 00:20:30,761
Um--

68
00:20:46,178 --> 00:20:49,947
Kind of a shame
to waste all this meat.
What do you think?

69
00:21:09,601 --> 00:21:12,703
I'm a little rusty
at this.

70
00:21:12,705 --> 00:21:15,373
Ted, why don't you
drag that over here?

71
00:21:19,378 --> 00:21:21,979
Okay.
Why don't you just put it
right under here?

72
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:26,851
Would you hold
your light up?

73
00:21:29,889 --> 00:21:33,090
Okay. Now look.

74
00:21:33,092 --> 00:21:38,929
Here's what you do.
You just...
just slide it in.

75
00:21:38,931 --> 00:21:44,402
And then you cut down.
You don't want to...
rupture the stomach.

76
00:21:50,776 --> 00:21:53,411
Then I gotta take
all the organs out.

77
00:22:00,652 --> 00:22:03,020
Get into that stomach.

78
00:22:06,925 --> 00:22:09,293
Oh, you see that?

79
00:22:09,295 --> 00:22:12,029
You gotta get
all of that out.

80
00:22:18,103 --> 00:22:20,171
Will you
hand me that saw?

81
00:23:00,645 --> 00:23:03,914
Here.
A souvenir.

82
00:24:25,764 --> 00:24:28,365
Leave the man alone, Ted!

83
00:25:30,462 --> 00:25:33,364
I see you.

84
00:26:24,683 --> 00:26:26,951
Haven't seen him this morning.
Should still be in there.

85
00:26:26,953 --> 00:26:28,953
- Should still be?
- He should.

86
00:26:41,701 --> 00:26:44,068
Mr. Colby.

87
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:51,742
Mr. Colby, this is, uh--
This is Deacon Whit.

88
00:26:51,744 --> 00:26:54,712
Oh, sorry to bother you.
But, uh,

89
00:26:54,714 --> 00:26:57,014
I'd like to ask you
a few questions, if I might.

90
00:26:58,617 --> 00:27:01,051
A little out of it.
I can understand that.

91
00:27:03,321 --> 00:27:05,656
Um,
so what brings you to town?

92
00:27:07,759 --> 00:27:10,227
Just passing through.

93
00:27:12,063 --> 00:27:14,331
You traveling alone?
Mm, yeah.

94
00:27:16,267 --> 00:27:19,703
I'm gonna need to see
your license and registration,
if you don't mind.

95
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:24,675
It's in the car,
wherever you guys towed it.

96
00:27:24,677 --> 00:27:26,710
Mind if I have a look
in the car?

97
00:27:28,146 --> 00:27:30,247
I'd prefer you didn't.
Hmm.

98
00:27:31,249 --> 00:27:33,083
Anything else?

99
00:27:33,085 --> 00:27:34,818
Looks like you got
banged up pretty bad.

100
00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:37,421
You might want to have
someone take a look at it.

101
00:27:40,625 --> 00:27:42,393
It's been nice
chatting with you.
Yup.

102
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,768
Thank you for comin' by.
You got it.

103
00:28:45,523 --> 00:28:47,791
Room service!

104
00:28:58,369 --> 00:29:00,838
Close the door.

105
00:29:08,947 --> 00:29:11,448
Need any
fresh towels?

106
00:29:11,450 --> 00:29:13,584
No, thanks.

107
00:29:13,586 --> 00:29:15,252
Want those clothes
cleaned?

108
00:29:15,254 --> 00:29:17,788
I can try
and get the stains out.

109
00:29:28,032 --> 00:29:29,867
You want it, kid?

110
00:29:33,071 --> 00:29:35,038
You want it?

111
00:29:38,710 --> 00:29:40,811
How did you do that?

112
00:29:43,948 --> 00:29:46,617
That's a secret,
little man.

113
00:29:48,419 --> 00:29:50,287
You have any secrets?

114
00:29:54,125 --> 00:29:56,627
Maybe.
Probably not.

115
00:30:04,135 --> 00:30:07,304
You wouldn't happen to know
where they towed my car,
would you?

116
00:30:07,306 --> 00:30:09,506
There's a junkyard
down the road.

117
00:30:56,888 --> 00:30:58,889
What ya doing, Whit?

118
00:30:58,891 --> 00:31:00,557
Oh, just poking around.

119
00:31:03,695 --> 00:31:07,064
Looking for anything
in particular?
I don't know really.

120
00:31:08,633 --> 00:31:11,568
I could look the other way,
if it'd make you feel better.

121
00:31:11,570 --> 00:31:13,704
No. Don't bother.

122
00:31:38,696 --> 00:31:40,230
Perfect.

123
00:31:41,432 --> 00:31:44,034
We've been driving forever.

124
00:31:44,036 --> 00:31:46,937
All right.
I could use somethin' to eat myself.

125
00:32:01,921 --> 00:32:04,655
Okay. Why don't
you guys hang here,
and I'll go check us in?

126
00:32:05,723 --> 00:32:08,058
Okay, hon.

127
00:32:26,644 --> 00:32:30,213
We got you--
We got you in Room 5.

128
00:32:30,215 --> 00:32:32,049
Right down here.

129
00:32:32,051 --> 00:32:35,052
We'll have a fresh pot of coffee
brewing for you in the lobby,

130
00:32:35,054 --> 00:32:36,954
first thing in the morning.
Okay.

131
00:32:36,956 --> 00:32:40,424
So if you need anything else,
don't hesitate to call on us.

132
00:32:40,426 --> 00:32:44,628
All right. Uh, a place to eat?
Do you know if
there's anywhere nearby?

133
00:32:44,630 --> 00:32:47,164
It's a bit of a drive
to the closest diner.

134
00:32:47,166 --> 00:32:50,634
I'll tell you what.
My son and I were just about
to have ourselves some dinner.

135
00:32:50,636 --> 00:32:52,903
- Why don't you join us?
- I don't know.

136
00:32:52,905 --> 00:32:55,339
And-And tomorrow morning,
you're not gonna believe
this view.

137
00:32:55,341 --> 00:32:57,307
And over there,
we've got ourselves a pool.

138
00:32:57,309 --> 00:32:59,142
Your son's
gonna love that.

139
00:33:06,317 --> 00:33:07,718
How y'all
like it cooked?

140
00:33:09,087 --> 00:33:11,588
Medium would be great.
Thank you.

141
00:33:14,292 --> 00:33:16,193
How long you guys
owned this place?

142
00:33:16,195 --> 00:33:19,997
Well, Ted's granddad,
he built this
with his own hands.

143
00:33:19,999 --> 00:33:21,832
Back when this was
a destination spot.

144
00:33:23,301 --> 00:33:25,535
People used to
drive here from all over,
just to--

145
00:33:25,537 --> 00:33:28,772
Just to see the view.

146
00:33:28,774 --> 00:33:32,776
This-- This is
all gonna be Ted's
one of these days.

147
00:33:32,778 --> 00:33:34,878
Isn't that right, Son?

148
00:35:01,199 --> 00:35:03,934
Mornin'.

149
00:35:03,936 --> 00:35:07,003
Honey, not too close
to the highway.

150
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:11,041
Honey!

151
00:35:13,611 --> 00:35:14,711
Oh!

152
00:35:16,147 --> 00:35:17,981
Oh, Jesus.

153
00:35:57,622 --> 00:35:59,489
Hey, you comin' in
or what?

154
00:35:59,491 --> 00:36:02,058
I don't have
a bathing suit.
Go in in your shorts.

155
00:37:42,460 --> 00:37:44,427
Okay.

156
00:37:45,296 --> 00:37:46,930
Ready.

157
00:37:47,965 --> 00:37:51,401
And away we go.

158
00:37:58,943 --> 00:38:01,011
Fuck.

159
00:38:07,451 --> 00:38:10,987
Come on.
I'll be right back.

160
00:38:17,161 --> 00:38:19,663
Well, best I can do
is call a mechanic.

161
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:28,104
How long you think
that will take?

162
00:38:28,106 --> 00:38:31,174
Mmm.
Long as it takes,
I guess.

163
00:38:31,176 --> 00:38:34,010
- Yeah.
-             Are you kidding me?

164
00:38:35,146 --> 00:38:37,914
Appreciate it.
Sure.

165
00:41:04,495 --> 00:41:06,996
Okay, you can come out now.

166
00:41:23,614 --> 00:41:26,816
Shit. Get in.

167
00:41:35,159 --> 00:41:36,726
Okay.

168
00:41:44,034 --> 00:41:45,935
Got it.

169
00:42:08,325 --> 00:42:09,792
You want it?

170
00:42:12,630 --> 00:42:15,465
Guests always
leave their junk behind.

171
00:42:22,039 --> 00:42:26,142
- Yeah, like what?
- Old magazines and things.

172
00:42:26,977 --> 00:42:29,479
Weird adult stuff.

173
00:42:31,682 --> 00:42:33,983
Occupational hazard,
I suppose.

174
00:42:37,655 --> 00:42:39,722
Where do you live?

175
00:42:42,526 --> 00:42:44,427
Nowhere now.

176
00:42:49,099 --> 00:42:50,934
I guess you're staying
with us for a while.

177
00:42:54,271 --> 00:42:56,940
If I didn't know better,
I'd say you stranded me here
on purpose.

178
00:43:08,419 --> 00:43:10,286
What's in the box?

179
00:43:20,064 --> 00:43:22,765
When people die,
they either bury 'em
in the ground...

180
00:43:24,568 --> 00:43:26,970
or they're burned down
into a box like this.

181
00:43:31,609 --> 00:43:33,476
There's a person in there?

182
00:43:42,252 --> 00:43:44,821
How do they do it?
In an oven?

183
00:43:48,559 --> 00:43:51,194
Yeah.

184
00:43:53,631 --> 00:43:55,798
Do you watch them?

185
00:44:06,076 --> 00:44:10,680
Can I see?
No.

186
00:44:10,682 --> 00:44:14,651
- Why not?
- You know what?
We better get goin'.

187
00:44:15,686 --> 00:44:17,654
Come on.

188
00:44:26,463 --> 00:44:29,699
It's just
you and your dad here, huh?
Yeah.

189
00:44:29,701 --> 00:44:32,201
Mom's in Florida.

190
00:44:32,203 --> 00:44:35,705
Oranges grow there
all year, and there
are 27 types of palm tress.

191
00:44:36,473 --> 00:44:38,875
Hmm. Sounds nice.

192
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:45,248
I don't really
remember her much.

193
00:44:48,152 --> 00:44:50,753
Left with a trucker
that was staying
in Room 5.

194
00:44:54,191 --> 00:44:57,093
Florida, huh?

195
00:44:57,995 --> 00:45:00,196
Never been.

196
00:45:00,198 --> 00:45:03,066
Wanna go?

197
00:45:03,068 --> 00:45:07,003
Can't say I know
where I'm going exactly,
but... you never know.

198
00:45:07,005 --> 00:45:09,639
If we drive straight through,
we can make it in two days.

199
00:45:09,641 --> 00:45:11,774
Or we can stop at a motel
for a night.

200
00:45:14,078 --> 00:45:18,514
What kind of car
do you have?
What kind of car do I have?

201
00:45:18,516 --> 00:45:22,118
Yeah.
I have a totaled car.
That's what kind of car I have.

202
00:45:23,921 --> 00:45:25,822
Smashed to bits.

203
00:45:41,839 --> 00:45:45,641
Thanks again.
Drive safe now.

204
00:45:56,553 --> 00:45:58,454
We got a customer?

205
00:46:01,692 --> 00:46:04,293
Inside, Ted.
We need to talk.

206
00:46:09,466 --> 00:46:11,100
How's it goin'?

207
00:46:27,551 --> 00:46:29,452
Get your hands
out of that drawer.

208
00:46:32,723 --> 00:46:37,059
Listen. We got ourselves
a little business
coming our way this weekend.

209
00:46:37,061 --> 00:46:38,795
What kind of business?

210
00:46:38,797 --> 00:46:41,164
It's called a prom.
You remember that
from a couple years ago?

211
00:46:41,166 --> 00:46:42,899
Isn't that the dance?
That's right.

212
00:46:43,967 --> 00:46:45,601
We're gonna
have a dance here?

213
00:46:45,603 --> 00:46:47,370
We're gonna have
the after-party at least.

214
00:46:48,672 --> 00:46:52,909
An after-party?
Just a little harmless fun.

215
00:46:52,911 --> 00:46:56,479
Let boys be boys.
Let girls be girls.

216
00:46:56,481 --> 00:46:59,081
You understand
what I'm saying, Ted?

217
00:46:59,083 --> 00:47:01,651
Just for one night.
All right?

218
00:47:07,958 --> 00:47:09,859
Keep your hands
out of there.

219
00:47:22,372 --> 00:47:25,374
Sorry about earlier.
I didn't mean
to scare you.

220
00:47:29,313 --> 00:47:30,847
It's okay.

221
00:47:33,116 --> 00:47:35,351
Wanna see somethin'?

222
00:47:39,189 --> 00:47:41,924
I promised my mom
I'd stay close to the hotel.

223
00:47:43,160 --> 00:47:45,394
<i>It's a motel not a hotel.</i>

224
00:51:28,752 --> 00:51:31,053
All righty.

225
00:51:31,055 --> 00:51:34,356
Well,
it's an electrical issue
is all.

226
00:51:34,358 --> 00:51:36,859
Wire'd come loose
and your fuse box
shorted out.

227
00:51:36,861 --> 00:51:39,962
So, replaced the fasteners
for good measure.
Oh, thank you.

228
00:51:39,964 --> 00:51:42,098
Don't mention it.
Good thing y'all were here,

229
00:51:42,100 --> 00:51:45,134
'cause, car conkin' out on you
on the highway,
you could be in trouble.

230
00:51:45,136 --> 00:51:47,369
Yeah.
Is it fixed?

231
00:51:47,371 --> 00:51:49,738
All fixed, ma'am.

232
00:51:49,740 --> 00:51:51,874
Whoo-hoo.
All right. Yeah.

233
00:51:51,876 --> 00:51:53,609
Benny--
Let's get goin', baby.
Grab that stuff.

234
00:51:53,611 --> 00:51:54,944
Yeah.

235
00:51:57,547 --> 00:52:00,716
In you go.
Thanks again.
No problem.

236
00:52:08,225 --> 00:52:10,326
Come visit us again!

237
00:52:12,562 --> 00:52:15,331
Room 5 just checked out.
And look what they
left behind.

238
00:52:19,636 --> 00:52:21,971
Oh.

239
00:52:23,473 --> 00:52:25,341
Can I keep it?
They might come back for it.

240
00:52:26,476 --> 00:52:28,344
Nobody ever comes back.

241
00:52:29,913 --> 00:52:33,749
Ted, the only one who's lived
here longer than you is me.

242
00:52:33,751 --> 00:52:35,184
I know how lonely it gets.

243
00:52:36,920 --> 00:52:39,355
And I know you wish
you had friends
your own age.

244
00:52:39,357 --> 00:52:41,257
Right?
I have friends.

245
00:52:41,259 --> 00:52:44,126
No, customers
don't count.

246
00:52:44,128 --> 00:52:47,163
Look, when I was, um--

247
00:52:49,533 --> 00:52:53,869
When I was your age,
the only memories I have
are of my dad... workin' here.

248
00:52:57,174 --> 00:53:00,676
I would follow him around,
eyes and ears wide open,
lookin' up at him.

249
00:53:02,546 --> 00:53:06,782
It just seemed like he was
carryin' this whole place
on his shoulders.

250
00:53:10,320 --> 00:53:13,389
You know, your eyes,
they're gonna see more than
I've seen in my entire life.

251
00:53:17,294 --> 00:53:20,462
I know we talked about you
runnin' this place some day.
But--

252
00:53:23,133 --> 00:53:25,734
Some things--
You know--

253
00:53:25,736 --> 00:53:27,603
Some things just don't--

254
00:53:34,578 --> 00:53:36,412
Oh, hell. You can keep it.
'Course you can.

255
00:53:39,349 --> 00:53:44,019
Why don't you, uh,
go ahead and break down
the bedding in Room 5?

256
00:53:44,021 --> 00:53:47,923
Do I have to?
Those linens aren't gonna
change themselves.

257
00:57:36,119 --> 00:57:38,987
Here, boy.

258
00:57:38,989 --> 00:57:41,356
- Here, boy.
-         Here, boy.

259
00:57:44,395 --> 00:57:47,162
Hey!
Shut the fuck up, Sid!

260
00:58:09,619 --> 00:58:11,353
Can I have one?

261
00:58:22,632 --> 00:58:24,566
You guys got bats.

262
00:58:27,670 --> 00:58:30,606
Yeah. I know
where they live.
Wanna see?

263
01:00:29,959 --> 01:00:32,160
Oh, hey.

264
01:00:32,162 --> 01:00:33,629
Oh, hey.

265
01:00:33,631 --> 01:00:35,797
I wanted to pay for tonight.

266
01:00:35,799 --> 01:00:38,200
Cash?
Yeah.

267
01:00:40,603 --> 01:00:42,504
Any word on my car?

268
01:00:42,506 --> 01:00:44,072
Not yet.

269
01:00:44,074 --> 01:00:46,041
I'll, um--

270
01:00:47,610 --> 01:00:49,645
I'll give 'em a call.

271
01:00:49,647 --> 01:00:51,980
'Preciate it.
Yeah.

272
01:00:51,982 --> 01:00:53,915
Hey. Look at that.

273
01:00:55,918 --> 01:00:59,021
If this damn screen
lets in one more mosquito--

274
01:01:00,923 --> 01:01:02,858
You wouldn't happen to
have an extra, would you?

275
01:01:12,168 --> 01:01:17,472
I, uh,
try not to smoke
in front of Ted.

276
01:01:17,474 --> 01:01:20,142
Don't want him
picking up any bad habits.

277
01:01:20,144 --> 01:01:23,879
I swear,
the kid's got eyes growing
out the back of his head.

278
01:01:25,515 --> 01:01:27,282
Yeah.

279
01:01:27,284 --> 01:01:30,352
Can't do
anything around here
without him watching.

280
01:01:32,055 --> 01:01:33,789
Must be hard
growing up out here.

281
01:01:34,691 --> 01:01:36,625
Uh-huh.

282
01:01:36,627 --> 01:01:39,895
People here,
they come and go.

283
01:01:42,131 --> 01:01:44,232
Hard not to get attached
to the guests.

284
01:01:46,069 --> 01:01:47,569
That so?

285
01:01:50,306 --> 01:01:52,374
Yeah. We had this one time
a while back.

286
01:01:52,376 --> 01:01:54,076
We had a family
stayin' here,

287
01:01:54,078 --> 01:01:58,046
and Ted, he got
a puppy-dog crush
on one of their girls.

288
01:01:58,048 --> 01:02:01,483
He was following her
around everywhere.

289
01:02:01,485 --> 01:02:06,221
Yeah, that poor kid,
he had his heart broken
when they finally checked out.

290
01:02:06,223 --> 01:02:08,990
He climbed in the back
of their station wagon
when no one was looking.

291
01:02:10,760 --> 01:02:14,529
And that family,
they drove for about
an hour before, uh--

292
01:02:14,531 --> 01:02:17,299
before they realized
they had themselves
a little stowaway.

293
01:02:19,569 --> 01:02:22,938
Dad turned his car around.
Had to drive all the way back,
drop Ted off.

294
01:02:24,907 --> 01:02:26,775
Sobbed
the whole way home.

295
01:02:28,277 --> 01:02:30,445
I'll make sure to double-check
my trunk before I leave.

296
01:02:33,683 --> 01:02:35,283
Boy can't help it.

297
01:02:38,554 --> 01:02:41,189
What would make my life
a lot easier...

298
01:02:43,025 --> 01:02:45,193
is if you
kept some distance.

299
01:02:50,967 --> 01:02:53,168
Lot of responsibility
running a motel.

300
01:02:54,637 --> 01:02:56,838
Must be hard to find the time
to be a dad.

301
01:03:04,113 --> 01:03:05,947
Boy's growing
like a weed.

302
01:03:08,050 --> 01:03:09,985
Won't be long before
he's bigger than me.

303
01:03:12,288 --> 01:03:14,489
I'll call the garage
for you.

304
01:03:16,225 --> 01:03:18,527
Won't be much longer I bet,
and then I, uh--

305
01:03:19,929 --> 01:03:21,730
I guess
you'll be on your way.

306
01:05:17,179 --> 01:05:20,248
You stole my money!

307
01:05:20,250 --> 01:05:22,450
It's called
freezing your assets.

308
01:05:22,452 --> 01:05:25,287
- You stole it!
- Tough titty.

309
01:05:25,289 --> 01:05:28,723
I'm keeping it for you.
You're a flight risk.

310
01:05:28,725 --> 01:05:32,193
Hey!

311
01:05:32,195 --> 01:05:33,862
Go put fresh towels
in Room 2.

312
01:05:35,097 --> 01:05:37,132
No!
You go clean up Room 2
right now.

313
01:05:37,134 --> 01:05:39,134
What did you just--
Say it again, Ted.

314
01:05:39,136 --> 01:05:42,771
Say it again.
Say it again.

315
01:05:44,740 --> 01:05:46,207
No!

316
01:05:47,643 --> 01:05:49,177
You--

317
01:08:02,511 --> 01:08:04,179
<i>Whit, you there?</i>

318
01:08:08,284 --> 01:08:11,052
Yeah.

319
01:08:11,054 --> 01:08:13,855
<i> Did some more digging
 into those plates you ran.</i>

320
01:08:13,857 --> 01:08:16,624
<i> The owner's wife
 has been deceased
 as of two weeks now.</i>

321
01:08:16,626 --> 01:08:18,660
<i> Circumstances of her death
 are pretty suspicious.</i>

322
01:08:21,964 --> 01:08:23,131
Go on.

323
01:08:23,133 --> 01:08:25,767
<i>Firefighters picked up a 10-80.</i>

324
01:08:25,769 --> 01:08:28,436
<i> Figured it was
 an electrical fire.
 Nobody home.</i>

325
01:08:28,438 --> 01:08:31,639
<i>They found a body
in the kitchen.
Now they're suspecting arson.</i>

326
01:08:38,781 --> 01:08:40,882
<i> Still there,
 Whit?</i>

327
01:08:40,884 --> 01:08:43,218
'Preciate that there, Jim.

328
01:08:45,554 --> 01:08:47,322
<i>There's an open investigation.</i>

329
01:08:47,324 --> 01:08:48,990
<i>William Colby
is a person of interest,</i>

330
01:08:48,992 --> 01:08:51,759
<i>but there's
no solid evidence yet.</i>

331
01:08:51,761 --> 01:08:54,596
<i>Seems like this couple
has a history
of insurance claims.</i>

332
01:08:54,598 --> 01:08:56,564
<i>They've been on a watch list
for the past--</i>

333
01:09:23,626 --> 01:09:25,193
Mind if I join you?

334
01:09:28,597 --> 01:09:30,198
Everything
all right?

335
01:09:32,034 --> 01:09:34,068
Can't wait to get
outta this place.

336
01:09:42,611 --> 01:09:44,646
I don't know.

337
01:09:44,648 --> 01:09:47,015
You got everything
a kid could ever want
right here.

338
01:09:53,155 --> 01:09:55,723
My wife grew up
in a place like this.

339
01:09:55,725 --> 01:09:58,259
You have a wife?
Had.

340
01:09:59,795 --> 01:10:01,396
Where is she now?

341
01:10:07,002 --> 01:10:08,736
She's the one in the box.

342
01:10:11,574 --> 01:10:13,241
How'd she die?

343
01:10:18,247 --> 01:10:21,616
There was...
a fire in our house.

344
01:10:24,019 --> 01:10:25,753
I couldn't get to her in time.

345
01:10:29,592 --> 01:10:31,459
When you leave,

346
01:10:33,329 --> 01:10:35,063
can you
take me with you?

347
01:10:43,240 --> 01:10:44,839
Maybe next time.

348
01:10:49,345 --> 01:10:51,312
You said you'd take me
to Florida.

349
01:10:56,953 --> 01:10:59,187
My wife and I wanted
a son like you.

350
01:11:03,859 --> 01:11:06,494
Your wife is nothing
but a pile of dirt now.

351
01:14:50,620 --> 01:14:52,653
What did you do with her?
Huh?

352
01:14:52,655 --> 01:14:54,655
Dad!
What did you do
with her?

353
01:14:54,657 --> 01:14:56,424
Dad!
Where is the bag?

354
01:14:56,426 --> 01:14:59,260
Where's the bag?
Ow! I don't have it!

355
01:14:59,262 --> 01:15:00,995
Ow!

356
01:15:00,997 --> 01:15:04,499
<i>Listen up.
I am not fucking around!
Where is she?</i>

357
01:15:04,501 --> 01:15:08,369
In the junkyard!
I hid her in the junkyard.

358
01:15:08,371 --> 01:15:09,871
Show me!

359
01:15:40,002 --> 01:15:41,402
Okay.

360
01:15:43,138 --> 01:15:45,439
Where is she?
It's back there.

361
01:15:47,809 --> 01:15:49,810
Where in the fucking back?

362
01:15:54,516 --> 01:15:56,117
Give me
the fucking bag.

363
01:16:03,859 --> 01:16:05,326
Ted.

364
01:16:10,332 --> 01:16:12,867
Do you have any fucking idea
what I've been through?

365
01:16:15,038 --> 01:16:16,604
Don't do this, Ted.

366
01:16:22,377 --> 01:16:23,844
Ted.

367
01:16:24,713 --> 01:16:26,447
Where'd you put the bag?

368
01:16:30,419 --> 01:16:32,820
Give me the fucking bag!

369
01:18:29,338 --> 01:18:32,139
<i>to all you couples out there
on the dance floor.</i>

370
01:18:32,141 --> 01:18:35,543
<i>Let's give all you seniors
a night to remember.</i>

371
01:18:35,545 --> 01:18:38,846
<i>But don't forget.
When prom's over, let's all
try to be responsible...</i>

372
01:18:38,848 --> 01:18:41,082
<i>and get home safe and sound.</i>

373
01:18:41,084 --> 01:18:45,486
<i>To the graduating class of 1989,
this one's for you.</i>

374
01:18:45,488 --> 01:18:47,488
<i>Take it away, seniors.</i>

375
01:20:05,101 --> 01:20:07,334
Whoo-hoo!

376
01:20:21,683 --> 01:20:24,518
There you go.

377
01:20:24,520 --> 01:20:27,555
- Enjoy yourselves.
- Thanks.

378
01:20:30,992 --> 01:20:35,496
What about Room 2?
Oh. Occupied.

379
01:20:35,498 --> 01:20:37,198
Thought you said
we'd have the whole place
to ourselves.

380
01:20:37,200 --> 01:20:38,866
No, I said
that we have a customer...

381
01:20:38,868 --> 01:20:41,869
might need to stay
another night or
a little longer, and--

382
01:20:42,771 --> 01:20:44,371
Sorry about that.

383
01:20:44,373 --> 01:20:47,875
The fuck you're sorry.
We had a deal.

384
01:20:47,877 --> 01:20:49,877
Well, you got
the rest of the place
to yourself.

385
01:20:51,713 --> 01:20:55,115
Listen, old man,

386
01:20:55,117 --> 01:20:57,985
I can take my party
elsewhere.

387
01:20:57,987 --> 01:21:02,389
So...
you either cut me a deal,
or I'm gonna get outta here.

388
01:21:02,391 --> 01:21:04,558
I've already
given you a discount.

389
01:21:04,560 --> 01:21:07,461
Okay.
I've given you a discount. Sir--

390
01:21:07,463 --> 01:21:09,530
Okay, listen. Hey.
Come back here.
Come back here.

391
01:21:09,532 --> 01:21:10,798
Come back here.

392
01:21:17,839 --> 01:21:20,407
All right.

393
01:21:21,409 --> 01:21:23,978
I'll knock off 10%.

394
01:21:23,980 --> 01:21:25,980
Ted, show him his rooms.

395
01:21:25,982 --> 01:21:27,748
Pretty sure
I can find it.

396
01:21:33,655 --> 01:21:35,623
Oh, yeah!

397
01:21:39,861 --> 01:21:42,429
We're running a dead motel, Son.

398
01:21:44,266 --> 01:21:46,433
These rooms
just don't know it yet.

399
01:21:52,240 --> 01:21:54,341
What could we do?

400
01:21:54,343 --> 01:21:57,578
You're the one
with the business sense.
Maybe you could figure it out.

401
01:22:00,048 --> 01:22:01,982
We could leave.

402
01:22:03,718 --> 01:22:05,586
You take after your mother.

403
01:22:33,616 --> 01:22:36,884
- Is that a freshman?
- Hey.

404
01:22:36,886 --> 01:22:39,887
Hold up.
You're that kid
who lives here, aren't you?

405
01:22:39,889 --> 01:22:42,456
Do you have any extra soap?

406
01:22:45,393 --> 01:22:47,161
Come on.
Just a little sip.

407
01:22:47,163 --> 01:22:48,963
It'll put hair
on your chest.

408
01:22:57,839 --> 01:23:00,507
Oh.

409
01:23:03,011 --> 01:23:04,678
It burns.

410
01:23:04,680 --> 01:23:07,881
- Holy shit.
- "It burns. It burns."

411
01:23:09,918 --> 01:23:11,919
You put fire
in my throat.

412
01:23:12,921 --> 01:23:14,855
Come on.
We were just playing.

413
01:23:14,857 --> 01:23:16,357
Come back!

414
01:24:03,004 --> 01:24:05,105
Marcus. Shots.

415
01:24:07,876 --> 01:24:10,377
Fuck you doin'?

416
01:24:13,548 --> 01:24:15,049
Let's go.

417
01:24:25,527 --> 01:24:27,261
Forgot my beer.

418
01:25:35,097 --> 01:25:36,964
Fuck.

419
01:25:39,834 --> 01:25:41,468
What the fuck?

420
01:25:41,470 --> 01:25:44,004
Holy shit.

421
01:25:45,640 --> 01:25:48,609
- What the fuck
were you doing?

422
01:25:48,611 --> 01:25:52,746
Let me go! Let me go!

423
01:25:54,082 --> 01:25:56,049
The fuck was that?

424
01:25:59,821 --> 01:26:02,022
Get up!

425
01:26:02,024 --> 01:26:03,724
He was groping Sarah!

426
01:26:04,926 --> 01:26:06,660
Ow! Ow!

427
01:26:06,662 --> 01:26:10,130
What the fuck
were you gonna do?
Let me go!

428
01:26:10,132 --> 01:26:11,698
Hey.
Stop it.

429
01:26:13,369 --> 01:26:15,269
Whoa, man, check it out.

430
01:26:18,373 --> 01:26:20,040
Ow!

431
01:26:21,976 --> 01:26:23,977
What the fuck?

432
01:26:26,682 --> 01:26:28,982
- No! No!
- Stop it!

433
01:26:28,984 --> 01:26:30,918
Stop it.

434
01:26:32,453 --> 01:26:34,488
What the fuck
is your problem, asshole?

435
01:26:34,490 --> 01:26:37,324
Marcus! Marcus, stop!

436
01:26:37,326 --> 01:26:39,393
Please! No!

437
01:26:39,395 --> 01:26:41,795
Marcus! Marcus!

438
01:26:43,364 --> 01:26:45,566
Fuck off!
Get the fuck out!

439
01:26:47,669 --> 01:26:49,102
Are you okay?

440
01:27:38,119 --> 01:27:39,786
Dad!

441
01:27:43,958 --> 01:27:47,127
Dad! Dad!

442
01:28:08,250 --> 01:28:09,850
Dad?

443
01:28:10,718 --> 01:28:12,185
Ted?

444
01:28:14,555 --> 01:28:16,223
What--

445
01:28:18,159 --> 01:28:19,960
What did they do to you?

446
01:28:21,429 --> 01:28:23,497
Dad--
Oh, my God.

447
01:28:23,499 --> 01:28:25,799
What did they do to you?

448
01:28:25,801 --> 01:28:27,200
Ted--

449
01:28:28,336 --> 01:28:30,170
Oh, goddamn it.

450
01:28:30,172 --> 01:28:32,406
Oh, goddamn it.

451
01:28:32,408 --> 01:28:35,575
Why? Huh?

452
01:28:35,577 --> 01:28:37,344
Why couldn't you
listen to me?

453
01:28:37,346 --> 01:28:41,748
Ted, what did I tell you?
What did I say, huh?

454
01:28:41,750 --> 01:28:45,085
You just leave 'em alone, right?
You leave 'em alone!

455
01:28:45,087 --> 01:28:47,120
Huh? You gotta
do everything your own way!

456
01:28:47,122 --> 01:28:49,623
Right? Oh, Ted--

457
01:28:51,527 --> 01:28:54,094
All right, you--
You wanna do things
your own way?

458
01:28:54,096 --> 01:28:56,330
You wanna run this place?
Is that it?

459
01:28:56,332 --> 01:28:58,665
Huh? All right,
well, here's the first rule.

460
01:28:58,667 --> 01:29:01,368
All right.
Here's the first... rule.

461
01:29:01,370 --> 01:29:03,470
You leave
the customers alone!

462
01:29:03,472 --> 01:29:05,372
Ted?

463
01:29:06,607 --> 01:29:09,943
You leave the goddamn
customers alone!

464
01:29:11,879 --> 01:29:14,281
Goddamn it, Ted.

465
01:29:19,387 --> 01:29:22,622
Ted?

466
01:29:22,624 --> 01:29:24,358
Ted!

467
01:29:51,052 --> 01:29:53,453
A sophomore, right?
A rising sophomore.

468
01:30:05,900 --> 01:30:07,768
Turn that music louder.
Come on.

469
01:30:51,212 --> 01:30:54,247
Fuck, yeah!

470
01:30:54,249 --> 01:30:57,117
Chug, chug, chug, chug!

471
01:30:57,119 --> 01:31:00,454
Chug! Go! Go! Chug!

472
01:31:00,456 --> 01:31:02,956
Come on!

473
01:32:26,240 --> 01:32:27,874
Sarah.

474
01:32:28,976 --> 01:32:31,645
Wake up. Wake up.

475
01:34:32,700 --> 01:34:35,068
Welcome to
the Mountain Vista Motel.

476
01:37:20,301 --> 01:37:22,101
Hope you had
a lovely stay.

477
01:40:46,874 --> 01:40:49,509
This is gonna sting
a little bit, buddy.

478
01:40:49,511 --> 01:40:51,110
All right.
Hold still.

479
01:40:53,047 --> 01:40:54,547
It's okay.

480
01:40:56,016 --> 01:40:58,418
Yeah, that's okay, buddy.

481
01:41:50,704 --> 01:41:53,372
When was the last time
you saw the man in Room 2?

482
01:41:56,543 --> 01:41:59,879
A few hours ago.
He was looking in some windows.

483
01:42:08,222 --> 01:42:10,523
Didn't he say
his wife died
in a fire?

484
01:42:22,002 --> 01:42:24,737
We gonna need to do
a whole sweep of this area.

485
01:42:24,739 --> 01:42:28,241
Put out an APB
on a William Colby.
C-O-L-B-Y.

486
01:42:38,418 --> 01:42:40,386
Sorry to hear
about your dad.

487
01:42:42,456 --> 01:42:44,257
You have
any other family?

488
01:42:46,627 --> 01:42:48,594
I have a mom in Florida.
