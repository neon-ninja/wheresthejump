1
00:00:25,818 --> 00:00:27,527
Tonight's the night.

2
00:00:27,778 --> 00:00:29,654
Cropsy's going to get what he deserves.

3
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:32,073
- Remember what he did to you, Snoop?
- Yeah!

4
00:00:32,074 --> 00:00:33,994
And when he beat up Jamie
really bad for nothing?

5
00:00:34,743 --> 00:00:37,453
Billy says Cropsy's been getting away
with this shit for years.

6
00:00:37,454 --> 00:00:39,163
If we pull this off,
it'll be the biggest number

7
00:00:39,164 --> 00:00:41,124
Camp Blackfoot has ever seen.

8
00:00:41,125 --> 00:00:42,792
I wanna find out who's in, okay?

9
00:00:42,793 --> 00:00:43,876
We're all in.

10
00:00:43,877 --> 00:00:46,879
- Jamie, you with us?
- Right.

11
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:48,548
- Snoop?
- Yeah, I'm in.

12
00:00:49,049 --> 00:00:50,174
Billy?

13
00:00:50,175 --> 00:00:52,427
What, are you kidding?
I can't stand that creep.

14
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:54,053
What about you?

15
00:00:54,888 --> 00:00:58,266
As long as I get to see that
motherfucker squirm.

16
00:00:58,267 --> 00:01:01,853
Don't worry. Tonight's the night
that we scare the shit out of Cropsy.

17
00:01:01,854 --> 00:01:03,604
Because when he wakes up,

18
00:01:03,605 --> 00:01:06,899
when he sees it,
he's gonna have a heart attack.

19
00:01:07,151 --> 00:01:10,528
He's gonna go crazy. He's gonna go crazy.

20
00:01:10,529 --> 00:01:12,363
Okay, Billy, let's see what you got.

21
00:01:21,081 --> 00:01:22,832
All right, where's Kent?

22
00:01:24,084 --> 00:01:25,585
He's already inside.

23
00:01:26,086 --> 00:01:29,464
- Matches. Matches, matches!
- Here.

24
00:01:40,642 --> 00:01:41,851
Sit, wait.

25
00:02:24,812 --> 00:02:28,523
Hold it. Okay, guys, this is it.
Take the light.

26
00:02:28,524 --> 00:02:33,361
Give me the box. Run around the back.
Let's get him.

27
00:02:33,362 --> 00:02:34,695
Do it!

28
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:54,627
Holy shit! We gotta get him out of there.

29
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:34,792
- I can't believe it.
- Come on, let's get out of here. Come on!

30
00:05:57,691 --> 00:06:00,776
- So how long you been working here?
- I started working Sunday.

31
00:06:00,777 --> 00:06:02,945
- Oh, yeah, you like your job?
- Yeah, it's fine. Great.

32
00:06:02,946 --> 00:06:05,656
When you seen what I seen,
you'll soon change your mind.

33
00:06:05,657 --> 00:06:07,783
Hey, listen, after two months
of working here,

34
00:06:07,784 --> 00:06:09,368
you're gonna feel like an old man.

35
00:06:09,703 --> 00:06:11,829
Guys like you won't last five minutes.

36
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:12,955
- Listen, I...
- Hey, listen, you got a minute?

37
00:06:12,956 --> 00:06:13,998
No, I'm supposed to be on duty...

38
00:06:13,999 --> 00:06:15,291
I wanna show you something
down the hall.

39
00:06:15,292 --> 00:06:18,878
After you see this guy, you'll never
wanna come back in here again.

40
00:06:19,546 --> 00:06:23,049
Man, this guy's burned so bad,
he's cooked.

41
00:06:23,383 --> 00:06:26,552
A fucking Big Mac. Overdone.

42
00:06:26,803 --> 00:06:28,471
You know what I mean?

43
00:06:29,014 --> 00:06:31,182
It's a miracle he's still alive.

44
00:06:31,183 --> 00:06:33,851
Was me, I'd prefer to be dead.

45
00:06:34,186 --> 00:06:36,687
No way I'd wanna be like this freak.

46
00:06:36,855 --> 00:06:38,564
He's a monster, man.

47
00:06:39,649 --> 00:06:42,610
I been working here 10 years
and I'm telling you,

48
00:06:42,611 --> 00:06:45,363
I ain't never seen anything like this.

49
00:06:46,031 --> 00:06:48,157
- In here, man. Come on, take a look.
- Listen, I gotta go.

50
00:06:48,158 --> 00:06:51,744
You wanna be a doctor, right?
This is what you gotta see.

51
00:06:51,995 --> 00:06:54,455
This is where it's at.

52
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:02,088
Now this is burns.

53
00:07:05,592 --> 00:07:07,718
You ain't never gonna forget this man.

54
00:07:08,178 --> 00:07:11,972
As long as you live,
you never gonna see a freak like this.

55
00:07:17,396 --> 00:07:19,480
Come on, man, take a look.

56
00:07:20,649 --> 00:07:23,192
You ain't gonna see nothing
standing over there.

57
00:07:24,152 --> 00:07:26,529
Come on, man, take a look.

58
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:30,408
Come on.

59
00:07:36,873 --> 00:07:39,083
Come on, take a look.

60
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:48,092
Oh, my God!

61
00:09:31,112 --> 00:09:32,696
It's been a long struggle,

62
00:09:32,697 --> 00:09:35,908
but now that you've regained
your strength, it's time for you to leave.

63
00:09:36,117 --> 00:09:38,327
Considering how badly
you were burned, you're lucky to be alive.

64
00:09:38,495 --> 00:09:40,496
The first few months outside
will be the hardest.

65
00:09:40,497 --> 00:09:42,831
We're sorry,
the skin grafts just didn't take.

66
00:09:42,832 --> 00:09:44,959
There's nothing more we can do
for at least six months.

67
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:46,669
I know you still resent those kids,

68
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:49,463
but try not to blame anyone
for what happened.

69
00:09:49,464 --> 00:09:51,924
It was an accident, purely an accident.

70
00:09:51,925 --> 00:09:55,553
You've got to forget your hatred.
Control your feelings for revenge.

71
00:09:55,554 --> 00:09:59,181
Anger and resentment won't
bring back the past. You know that.

72
00:09:59,182 --> 00:10:02,935
You may find it difficult, at first,
to adjust to a normal life again.

73
00:10:02,936 --> 00:10:05,980
But with time you will adjust.

74
00:10:49,524 --> 00:10:51,525
Well, this is home, honey.

75
00:10:57,991 --> 00:11:00,242
Hey, if you're coming in,
why don't you come on in?

76
00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:02,745
I mean, ain't no use standing out there.

77
00:11:14,466 --> 00:11:17,885
Are you coming up? 'Cause I'm going in.

78
00:11:34,444 --> 00:11:38,030
Like the low-key lighting?
That's all right with me.

79
00:11:42,452 --> 00:11:44,411
Aren't you gonna take off your hat?

80
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:49,416
Of course, if you wanna keep your hat on,
keep your hat on.

81
00:11:49,417 --> 00:11:51,877
I mean, I got guys who wanna do
it wearing all sorts.

82
00:11:54,005 --> 00:11:56,256
Of course, you're the one who's paying.

83
00:11:57,092 --> 00:12:00,052
All right, do me a favor, will you, honey?
Let's move it?

84
00:12:00,345 --> 00:12:02,096
I mean, I gotta earn a living.

85
00:12:16,903 --> 00:12:18,070
Oh, my God!

86
00:12:19,823 --> 00:12:22,908
Who are you? Leave me alone.

87
00:12:22,909 --> 00:12:26,995
Will you, please? Please, just go.

88
00:12:28,081 --> 00:12:30,624
Just please go. I... Please go!

89
00:12:30,625 --> 00:12:34,753
No! No, get away!
Get away from me, please!

90
00:12:37,006 --> 00:12:37,923
Help!

91
00:12:40,885 --> 00:12:42,761
Help! Help!

92
00:13:20,175 --> 00:13:23,343
Rhoda! Rhoda! Rhoda!

93
00:13:26,723 --> 00:13:28,182
Come on!

94
00:13:47,786 --> 00:13:49,244
Throw the ball!

95
00:14:00,256 --> 00:14:03,550
- Look at that ass. See that?
- Oh, yeah.

96
00:14:03,551 --> 00:14:06,261
I want it, I want it.
I mean, you don't got to wrap it,

97
00:14:06,262 --> 00:14:10,098
you don't have to send it.
Take it home, now, as is.

98
00:14:10,099 --> 00:14:12,559
You're crazy, man. That's a no-sale.

99
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,895
Hey, it's mine by divine right.

100
00:14:14,896 --> 00:14:17,648
Hey, divine this, that's prime meat.
You ain't buying it.

101
00:14:19,442 --> 00:14:21,610
- You try it, man.
- Watch this.

102
00:14:21,611 --> 00:14:25,113
Now we're cooking on gas!
Throw the ball! Throw it!

103
00:14:26,533 --> 00:14:29,493
- You're not doing anything tonight, right?
- Why? Who wants to know?

104
00:14:29,494 --> 00:14:31,286
I want you at the rec room at 8:30.

105
00:14:31,287 --> 00:14:32,830
- Eddy!
- Just be there.

106
00:14:35,208 --> 00:14:37,292
Nice try, Eddy. Nice try.

107
00:14:37,293 --> 00:14:38,961
What do you say now, sucker?

108
00:14:38,962 --> 00:14:41,088
You old smoothie, you.
You're a devil, ain't you?

109
00:14:41,089 --> 00:14:42,965
Natch, baby, natch.

110
00:14:42,966 --> 00:14:44,716
Come on, come on!

111
00:14:47,679 --> 00:14:49,847
Tiger, run! That's yours!

112
00:15:24,299 --> 00:15:26,008
Jeez, it's gotta be here somewhere.

113
00:15:26,009 --> 00:15:29,761
Tiger, come on, forget it!
We'll use another ball.

114
00:15:38,855 --> 00:15:41,273
Come on, Tiger. Find the ball.

115
00:15:43,401 --> 00:15:45,235
Give me a chance. I'll find it.

116
00:16:04,088 --> 00:16:05,255
Got it!

117
00:16:05,256 --> 00:16:06,673
All right, Tiger!

118
00:16:30,114 --> 00:16:32,574
Karen, Todd and I have been
going out for years.

119
00:16:32,575 --> 00:16:35,577
You can't expect it to be the same
with Eddy. You just met him.

120
00:16:35,578 --> 00:16:39,081
- I know, but...
- Tiger! Stop it.

121
00:16:39,082 --> 00:16:40,666
Sophie, don't encourage her.

122
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:42,626
I really like Eddy.

123
00:16:42,627 --> 00:16:47,464
But every time I think he's serious and I
really start to get into him, he blows it.

124
00:16:47,465 --> 00:16:48,590
- I've had it.
- So...

125
00:16:49,676 --> 00:16:51,134
Oh, Tiger, stop that!

126
00:16:54,138 --> 00:16:58,141
Sometimes he really scares me. It's true.

127
00:16:59,102 --> 00:17:01,770
It's got so I told the supervisor
I didn't want to go on the overnight.

128
00:17:01,771 --> 00:17:04,106
You're kidding! What did he say?

129
00:17:05,316 --> 00:17:08,276
He said if things got too heavy
I could come back to camp.

130
00:17:08,277 --> 00:17:10,862
Karen, I think that if you feel
that badly about Eddy,

131
00:17:10,863 --> 00:17:12,903
you should just tell him that
you're not interested.

132
00:17:13,533 --> 00:17:14,700
I can't.

133
00:17:16,119 --> 00:17:20,372
See, sometimes I really like him.

134
00:17:21,082 --> 00:17:23,417
You better just get on with it, then.

135
00:18:43,873 --> 00:18:45,165
- Hey, Sally.
- Hi, Barb.

136
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:48,168
Hey, Dave show up last night?

137
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:22,888
Michelle? Michelle, is that you?

138
00:20:23,764 --> 00:20:26,433
Okay, everybody. Time to get up.
Come on.

139
00:20:27,935 --> 00:20:30,020
Wake up, Tiger. We're late. Come on.

140
00:20:30,897 --> 00:20:32,564
Sophie, my love.

141
00:20:33,065 --> 00:20:35,692
- Hey, gorgeous, rise and shine.
- Michelle.

142
00:20:35,693 --> 00:20:39,613
Come on, you guys. It's a beautiful day.

143
00:20:43,117 --> 00:20:44,910
Michelle, is that you?

144
00:20:48,164 --> 00:20:49,539
Who's there?

145
00:20:56,964 --> 00:20:58,256
Did you hear that?

146
00:21:06,557 --> 00:21:07,933
What's going on?

147
00:21:10,645 --> 00:21:13,104
Sally, Sally, what is it? What happened?

148
00:21:13,105 --> 00:21:17,442
Alfred. Alfred, he looked at me
in the shower and he wouldn't leave.

149
00:21:18,903 --> 00:21:21,154
Hold it, hold it. Where you going?

150
00:21:22,782 --> 00:21:25,075
Come here. Come on.

151
00:21:27,787 --> 00:21:30,538
You are sick. You know that?
You are really sick.

152
00:21:30,539 --> 00:21:32,040
Wait a minute. What's going on here?

153
00:21:32,208 --> 00:21:35,001
Alfred's been prowling around
the girls' shower.

154
00:21:39,006 --> 00:21:40,966
- Karen, take sally up to the bunk, okay?
- Okay.

155
00:21:40,967 --> 00:21:42,842
Just take it easy for a while, honey.

156
00:21:44,887 --> 00:21:47,305
What do you have to say
about that, Alfred?

157
00:21:47,807 --> 00:21:49,057
I only meant to scare her.

158
00:21:49,058 --> 00:21:52,727
You only meant to scare her!
Well, you sure as hell did scare her.

159
00:21:52,728 --> 00:21:55,768
- Okay. Eddy, take him up to the rec room.
- You are some sort of degenerate!

160
00:21:55,856 --> 00:21:58,733
- I'll talk with him.
- You'll talk with him?

161
00:22:03,489 --> 00:22:05,365
He's a sexual pervert.

162
00:22:05,366 --> 00:22:07,075
What do you expect me to do,
cut his balls off?

163
00:22:07,076 --> 00:22:08,243
That kid's weird, Todd.

164
00:22:08,244 --> 00:22:10,287
What the hell was he doing
snooping around here?

165
00:22:10,288 --> 00:22:13,248
- He's just a kid. Kids do that.
- Did you do that?

166
00:22:13,249 --> 00:22:15,333
Why the hell are you covering
for him anyway?

167
00:22:15,334 --> 00:22:16,918
I think we should throw him out.

168
00:22:16,919 --> 00:22:19,838
Okay. So he's a little strange. But I'll talk with him.
I'll straighten him out.

169
00:22:19,839 --> 00:22:21,464
You're a pushover.

170
00:22:22,508 --> 00:22:24,968
You always believe the best.
You're too easy.

171
00:22:26,053 --> 00:22:27,387
Okay, listen.

172
00:22:27,596 --> 00:22:31,266
If I think he's going to be a problem,
I'll make sure he's off the camp, okay?

173
00:22:33,144 --> 00:22:36,479
- Okay?
- Okay.

174
00:22:41,777 --> 00:22:43,903
All right, Alfred.
What the hell were you doing out there?

175
00:22:43,904 --> 00:22:45,655
What were you trying to pull?

176
00:22:45,656 --> 00:22:48,116
Come on, if you don't talk to me,
you're gonna be talking to the supervisor.

177
00:22:48,117 --> 00:22:50,327
And I don't think you want that.

178
00:22:50,328 --> 00:22:52,245
You know, I saved you
a lot of embarrassment out there

179
00:22:52,246 --> 00:22:54,914
by not bawling you out
in front of the other kids.

180
00:22:54,915 --> 00:22:58,251
I think you owe me something for that.
Start talking.

181
00:23:00,004 --> 00:23:02,130
I only wanted to scare her.

182
00:23:02,131 --> 00:23:04,090
You think she's gonna understand that?

183
00:23:04,091 --> 00:23:07,302
Or the supervisor? Or Glazer?
What about Glazer?

184
00:23:07,303 --> 00:23:10,722
Look, it's not just Glazer. It's everybody.

185
00:23:10,890 --> 00:23:14,559
I mean, they're all always picking on me.

186
00:23:15,061 --> 00:23:17,020
I don't have any friends.

187
00:23:18,356 --> 00:23:21,524
I didn't want to come to this camp
to begin with, you know.

188
00:23:21,525 --> 00:23:23,568
It's like the army. I mean,

189
00:23:24,195 --> 00:23:27,113
someone's always telling me
what to do all the time.

190
00:23:27,114 --> 00:23:28,907
It's the same thing every year.

191
00:23:28,908 --> 00:23:30,992
I sort of know what you're going through.

192
00:23:30,993 --> 00:23:34,079
Five years ago,
when I was in summer camp,

193
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:37,665
I didn't just get bawled out
by the counselor. I got sent home.

194
00:23:37,666 --> 00:23:39,334
- You did?
- Yeah.

195
00:23:39,335 --> 00:23:42,796
You don't have to take on
this whole camp by yourself.

196
00:23:42,797 --> 00:23:46,591
If you've got a problem,
if you want someone to talk to, I'm here.

197
00:23:46,592 --> 00:23:47,634
Okay?

198
00:23:50,012 --> 00:23:51,179
Okay.

199
00:23:52,681 --> 00:23:56,518
I'd have socked him right in the eye.
He's real spooky, that Alfred.

200
00:23:56,519 --> 00:24:00,188
- Imagine, creeping around the shower.
- I'm sure he didn't really mean it.

201
00:24:00,189 --> 00:24:03,316
He said he just wanted to scare you,
to get back at Glazer.

202
00:24:03,317 --> 00:24:04,692
That's great, isn't it?

203
00:24:04,693 --> 00:24:07,362
He wants to get back at Glazer,
so he scares the shit out of Sally?

204
00:24:07,363 --> 00:24:09,030
Let's forget about it?

205
00:24:09,031 --> 00:24:10,698
We have the canoe trip
to look forward to.

206
00:24:10,699 --> 00:24:14,411
Yeah, Sally, just think.
Three nights alone with Alfred.

207
00:24:15,538 --> 00:24:17,705
Hey, you gonna make it
with Glazer, Sally?

208
00:24:17,706 --> 00:24:18,790
Cool it, Marnie.

209
00:24:19,667 --> 00:24:22,585
- Imagine doing it with Glazer.
- Doing what?

210
00:24:23,045 --> 00:24:25,088
The weight of all those muscles on you.

211
00:24:28,509 --> 00:24:29,968
I'd take Alfred any day.

212
00:24:30,511 --> 00:24:32,137
Lay off, will you?

213
00:24:32,388 --> 00:24:34,514
Why's everyone so down on Glazer?

214
00:24:39,395 --> 00:24:41,271
Look out where you're going, punk.

215
00:24:41,814 --> 00:24:44,607
You know, I ought to break your legs?

216
00:24:44,859 --> 00:24:47,068
And twist your head off.

217
00:24:47,069 --> 00:24:49,612
Now, I'm gonna tell you just one time.

218
00:24:50,156 --> 00:24:53,575
You stay away from my girl.
You understand that?

219
00:24:59,790 --> 00:25:03,001
What are you staring at,
you little fucking weirdo?

220
00:25:03,627 --> 00:25:05,712
Look, I'm warning you.

221
00:25:05,713 --> 00:25:08,214
If I even catch you looking at her,

222
00:25:08,507 --> 00:25:13,470
I'm gonna tear you up so bad,
your own mother won't recognize you.

223
00:25:14,054 --> 00:25:15,305
- You dig?
- Glazer!

224
00:25:15,973 --> 00:25:19,559
- What's your problem?
- Oh, no problem, Todd. No problem.

225
00:25:20,436 --> 00:25:22,812
All right, get out of here, you understand?

226
00:25:27,485 --> 00:25:29,152
And remember, it's a long summer.

227
00:25:30,154 --> 00:25:32,363
Little jerk gives me the creeps.

228
00:25:33,324 --> 00:25:36,409
And when was the last time you won
a personality contest, Glazer?

229
00:25:36,410 --> 00:25:38,036
Hey, what's the matter, Todd?

230
00:25:38,287 --> 00:25:39,787
You ought to ease up on me, man.

231
00:25:39,788 --> 00:25:41,164
You're coming down on the wrong guy.

232
00:25:41,165 --> 00:25:43,541
He's the one that was caught
looking at the girls in the shower.

233
00:25:43,542 --> 00:25:45,293
You ought to be coming down
hard on him.

234
00:25:45,294 --> 00:25:48,630
- You know what your problem is?
- No, man, what's my problem?

235
00:25:48,631 --> 00:25:51,674
- You can't take anyone your own size.
- Oh, yeah? Well, that's bullshit.

236
00:25:51,675 --> 00:25:53,885
Yeah, well, let me tell you something.

237
00:25:53,886 --> 00:25:56,888
You cause any problems
for any kid on this camp,

238
00:25:56,889 --> 00:25:58,973
and I'm gonna bust your ass.

239
00:26:14,156 --> 00:26:16,449
Come on, Alfred. You gotta do
the swimming thing, all right?

240
00:26:16,450 --> 00:26:19,118
Because if you go in tomorrow,
I can't go in after you.

241
00:26:19,119 --> 00:26:21,079
I don't think this will work out.

242
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:23,957
Don't wuss out on us. Just...
Fish, listen to Fish.

243
00:26:23,958 --> 00:26:27,001
- He's been in, right?
- Look, it's beautiful water.

244
00:26:27,002 --> 00:26:28,670
There's no problem
in swimming or diving.

245
00:26:28,671 --> 00:26:30,672
- I mean, your head's the main thing.
- Head's the main thing.

246
00:26:30,673 --> 00:26:32,131
- It's the heaviest part of your body.
- Right.

247
00:26:32,132 --> 00:26:34,092
So, wherever your head goes,
your body's gotta follow. Right?

248
00:26:34,093 --> 00:26:36,261
And you'll be in big trouble if it doesn't.

249
00:26:36,262 --> 00:26:37,971
- Dave, Dave, look.
- Hi, girls.

250
00:26:37,972 --> 00:26:38,930
- Hey, girls!
- Hey!

251
00:26:39,890 --> 00:26:40,848
Hi, guys.

252
00:26:41,517 --> 00:26:43,268
Give him a little encouragement.

253
00:26:43,269 --> 00:26:44,352
Look, it's no problem.

254
00:26:44,353 --> 00:26:46,229
- Just watch Fish.
- Watch me.

255
00:26:46,230 --> 00:26:47,814
Esther Williams, look at that.

256
00:26:48,190 --> 00:26:51,150
- And we know Flipper!
- Go, go!

257
00:26:51,151 --> 00:26:53,736
- You see how easy that is?
- I hate swimming.

258
00:26:54,530 --> 00:26:58,116
Not much you do like? Drown.

259
00:26:59,285 --> 00:27:00,868
Follow me, Alfred, all right?

260
00:27:23,559 --> 00:27:25,476
Are you crazy? He can't swim.

261
00:27:25,477 --> 00:27:29,522
Yeah, I'm crazy, and you better save him
if you don't want him to drown.

262
00:27:30,065 --> 00:27:31,149
Help!

263
00:27:31,150 --> 00:27:34,027
Hey, Sally? I'm coming to get you, babe.

264
00:27:36,739 --> 00:27:40,241
- Are you okay, man?
- Hey, want me to fix Glazer for you, man?

265
00:27:40,242 --> 00:27:42,160
- Get him up.
- Come on, get him up. Get him up.

266
00:27:42,745 --> 00:27:44,078
Come on, bring him up.

267
00:27:44,079 --> 00:27:46,664
Lie down, on your back. On your back, Al.

268
00:27:47,583 --> 00:27:50,668
You all right? You breathing?
You breathing? That a boy.

269
00:27:50,669 --> 00:27:54,839
You all right? Speak to me.
Come on, speak to me, Al.

270
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:56,633
That's it, don't cough. Speak. Words.

271
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:59,761
- I'm okay.
- All right. All right.

272
00:28:03,599 --> 00:28:04,682
Hi, girls!

273
00:28:07,478 --> 00:28:09,854
You look like a bunch of mermaids
up here. You know that?

274
00:28:10,272 --> 00:28:12,774
- Don't worry. He'll get his.
- Yeah? I gotta tell you.

275
00:28:12,775 --> 00:28:14,734
Fifty bucks buys you the top torpedo
in town.

276
00:28:14,735 --> 00:28:16,778
- Who's that? Woodstock?
- Sure.

277
00:28:16,779 --> 00:28:19,781
Oh, come on. Woodstock couldn't knock
over an umbrella stand.

278
00:28:19,782 --> 00:28:24,369
- Got the pea-shooter with you, Woody?
- Yeah, I sure do.

279
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:25,703
Right there.

280
00:28:29,541 --> 00:28:32,335
- Hi, Sally. Hi, pretty girl.
- Hi.

281
00:28:32,836 --> 00:28:34,420
Hey, Sal, you wanna go
for a swim with me?

282
00:28:34,421 --> 00:28:35,505
No way.

283
00:28:36,632 --> 00:28:39,467
- What's the matter?
- I don't wanna get my hair wet.

284
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:46,891
All right, guys, I got him in my range.

285
00:28:47,810 --> 00:28:49,268
Hey, Dave.

286
00:28:50,145 --> 00:28:52,980
Are sure you want me
to go through with this?

287
00:28:53,482 --> 00:28:57,193
Alfred. This is about to be
the greatest moment in your life.

288
00:28:58,654 --> 00:29:05,576
There will be four commands:
Ready, aim, fire and run.

289
00:29:05,911 --> 00:29:09,288
Glazer's gonna go crazy. Shit!

290
00:29:09,957 --> 00:29:15,753
Ready. Aim. Pork him!

291
00:29:17,506 --> 00:29:19,173
Shit, what the hell was that?

292
00:29:26,306 --> 00:29:27,932
You think that's funny?

293
00:29:27,933 --> 00:29:29,809
Woodstock, I think you got him.

294
00:29:31,729 --> 00:29:34,188
You aren't gonna think it's so funny
when I get my hands on you.

295
00:29:34,189 --> 00:29:36,482
And Woodstock, you're a dead boy,
you hear me?

296
00:29:42,322 --> 00:29:43,698
Sorry, Glazer.

297
00:29:44,450 --> 00:29:47,368
You won't think that's so funny
when I get my hands on you.

298
00:29:47,369 --> 00:29:48,619
You're a dead boy...

299
00:29:58,547 --> 00:30:00,423
- How many?
- Give me three.

300
00:30:00,424 --> 00:30:03,217
- All right.
- I'll take three.

301
00:30:03,218 --> 00:30:04,552
All right.

302
00:30:10,642 --> 00:30:13,478
- Howdy do, boys? What are you doing?
- Hey, how you doing?

303
00:30:13,479 --> 00:30:16,814
He's under, he's up, he's in there.
All right.

304
00:30:16,815 --> 00:30:18,733
- Who ordered the Playboy?
- Over here.

305
00:30:18,734 --> 00:30:21,319
Dave, did you get my Hustler?

306
00:30:21,695 --> 00:30:23,446
Hustler? What do you want
with Hustler, Woodstock?

307
00:30:23,447 --> 00:30:26,699
- You're too small.
- Hey, size never stopped Woody.

308
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:29,076
That's the world bantam-weight
jerk-off champ over there?

309
00:30:29,077 --> 00:30:31,704
Just stick with me, kid.
Keep flexing the muscle?

310
00:30:55,354 --> 00:30:57,563
God bless her mom and dad.

311
00:30:57,564 --> 00:30:59,941
You guys are a real bunch of wimps.
You know that?

312
00:31:00,108 --> 00:31:03,528
Looking at girlie magazines.
You guys make me sick.

313
00:31:04,112 --> 00:31:05,738
You ought to try the real thing
sometimes, man.

314
00:31:05,739 --> 00:31:06,864
Let me tell you that.

315
00:31:06,865 --> 00:31:09,617
We make you sick, do we, Glazer?

316
00:31:09,618 --> 00:31:12,787
Well, then, you won't mind paying a
new market price for a bag of rubbers.

317
00:31:12,788 --> 00:31:14,121
Five bucks.

318
00:31:14,540 --> 00:31:17,291
- I'll pay. Get me what I asked for?
- Absolutely, absolutely.

319
00:31:17,292 --> 00:31:20,294
Absolutely? Absolutely shit, man.

320
00:31:20,712 --> 00:31:22,922
Look, I asked for lubricated rubbers.

321
00:31:22,923 --> 00:31:25,049
These aren't lubricated rubbers,
you understand that?

322
00:31:25,050 --> 00:31:26,634
What am I? Masters & Johnson?

323
00:31:26,635 --> 00:31:28,553
You want lubes, buy your own.

324
00:31:28,554 --> 00:31:31,848
All right, I'll buy my own.
And let me tell you something, pal.

325
00:31:31,849 --> 00:31:34,684
- I ain't paying for these. You got that?
- I got that.

326
00:31:50,993 --> 00:31:53,286
- What's up, man?
- My God!

327
00:31:54,413 --> 00:31:57,665
- What are you looking at?
- At the window, there.

328
00:31:58,250 --> 00:32:00,334
There, there, at the window.

329
00:32:00,794 --> 00:32:03,546
- Take it easy, man. What's going on?
- It was a face.

330
00:32:03,547 --> 00:32:05,631
A horrible face at the window.

331
00:32:07,384 --> 00:32:08,801
Yeah, forget it, girls.

332
00:32:09,636 --> 00:32:11,012
I saw it. It was there.

333
00:32:11,013 --> 00:32:13,097
Well, there sure as hell
ain't nothing out there now.

334
00:32:26,612 --> 00:32:28,237
What's that? Who's in there?

335
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:51,636
Hey, you wanna know something, man?
You're weird.

336
00:32:51,637 --> 00:32:54,055
That's your fucking problem, man.
You're a weirdo, man.

337
00:32:56,642 --> 00:32:58,851
Hey, what's keeping you guys?
There's not gonna be any dinner left.

338
00:32:58,852 --> 00:33:00,811
Come on, let's go. Come on.

339
00:33:01,229 --> 00:33:03,064
Forget this. Let's go get the girls.

340
00:33:03,065 --> 00:33:05,900
So you saw a face? Shit!

341
00:33:09,738 --> 00:33:12,907
- What was all that about?
- Nothing.

342
00:33:31,176 --> 00:33:34,220
We made it! Don't worry, guys.

343
00:33:34,805 --> 00:33:37,264
What's this? Oh, my God!

344
00:33:37,766 --> 00:33:39,850
Good shot, kid, good shot.

345
00:33:40,435 --> 00:33:44,939
Ladies! They're eating without us!
They're eating without us!

346
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:47,024
You're late! You are late!

347
00:33:49,778 --> 00:33:51,278
Hey, girls.

348
00:33:52,155 --> 00:33:54,031
- Hi, Sally.
- Oh, God.

349
00:33:54,032 --> 00:33:56,367
- How you doing?
- Okay.

350
00:33:56,368 --> 00:33:59,453
Okay? Just doing okay? You look good.

351
00:34:00,414 --> 00:34:03,457
Hey, what do you say you and me go
for a ride tomorrow in my canoe?

352
00:34:04,584 --> 00:34:07,211
- Maybe.
- Maybe? What do you mean, maybe?

353
00:34:07,212 --> 00:34:09,547
Hey, what's the matter?
You don't trust me?

354
00:34:10,590 --> 00:34:13,968
- Hey, Redford, let's go. Come on?
- Wait a minute, I'm talking to her.

355
00:34:13,969 --> 00:34:17,221
"Hey, I'm talking to her."
Can I talk to her, too?

356
00:34:17,806 --> 00:34:20,224
Hey, Todd! Todd?

357
00:34:20,225 --> 00:34:22,351
- Glazer, calm down.
- Yeah.

358
00:34:22,352 --> 00:34:25,980
- What are you staring at, you little creep?
- Hey, Glazer.

359
00:34:26,148 --> 00:34:28,315
Come off it, what harm is he doing?

360
00:34:28,608 --> 00:34:30,568
He's been staring at me,
that's the harm he's doing.

361
00:34:30,569 --> 00:34:32,028
Maybe he wants your body, Glazer.

362
00:34:33,321 --> 00:34:36,407
So, you girls all set
for the trip tomorrow?

363
00:34:36,408 --> 00:34:40,244
Nothing I can get you? Life jacket?
Spermicide?

364
00:34:41,329 --> 00:34:43,914
Hey, you gotta be prepared.
You know what I mean?

365
00:34:46,293 --> 00:34:47,209
Oh, God!

366
00:34:48,128 --> 00:34:50,087
All right, which one of you guys
got my vitamin E?

367
00:34:50,088 --> 00:34:53,132
Vitamin E? Christ, Woodstock,
you don't believe in all that crap?

368
00:34:53,133 --> 00:34:56,135
Just don't knock it.
You leave my champ alone?

369
00:34:56,720 --> 00:34:59,638
- Well, I haven't got it.
- Well, I'm going back to the cabin to get it.

370
00:35:00,849 --> 00:35:02,808
Quiet. Quiet, please.

371
00:35:05,020 --> 00:35:06,312
Quiet, please.

372
00:35:07,147 --> 00:35:09,523
Quiet. Quiet, please.

373
00:35:20,243 --> 00:35:23,788
- Come on, let's keep it... Come on, quiet.
- Quiet!

374
00:35:27,209 --> 00:35:28,375
That's better.

375
00:35:29,127 --> 00:35:32,630
Okay, I just want to say a couple of things
about the overnight.

376
00:35:32,881 --> 00:35:35,341
Some of you older ones
are leaving tomorrow

377
00:35:35,342 --> 00:35:37,301
for a three-day canoe
trip to Devil's Creek.

378
00:35:38,261 --> 00:35:41,514
I know you can all look after yourselves
pretty good.

379
00:35:41,515 --> 00:35:45,059
Just remember,
it's a long way from home.

380
00:36:19,928 --> 00:36:21,303
Shit!

381
00:36:39,447 --> 00:36:42,366
Well, I guess you've all
made friends by now,

382
00:36:42,367 --> 00:36:45,536
so however you team up,
stick with your buddy.

383
00:37:54,981 --> 00:37:58,984
- Woodstock?
- Todd, you scared the shit out of me.

384
00:37:58,985 --> 00:38:00,611
Come on, let's go.

385
00:38:06,159 --> 00:38:10,871
Sorry I scared you. Glazer and Fish said
you were really sick. I was worried.

386
00:38:11,873 --> 00:38:14,375
- Why'd they say that?
- I don't know.

387
00:38:15,627 --> 00:38:20,047
Just a dumb joke. I'm getting a little
fed up with Glazer's sense of humor.

388
00:38:22,133 --> 00:38:26,136
One other thing. I want
one good swimmer with each group.

389
00:38:26,638 --> 00:38:29,515
That means one in each canoe,
at all times.

390
00:38:30,141 --> 00:38:33,227
One more stunt like that
and you're on your way home, got it?

391
00:38:33,228 --> 00:38:34,478
That goes for you, too.

392
00:38:34,479 --> 00:38:36,897
Done this trip before,
and they know the scene.

393
00:38:36,898 --> 00:38:40,359
And one final thing.
Before you leave for the overnighter,

394
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:44,196
please check in with me to confirm
your travel arrangements home.

395
00:38:44,572 --> 00:38:46,907
- Got it?
- We got it.

396
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:10,597
Hey, Woodstock, straighten up.

397
00:39:11,266 --> 00:39:14,143
I'm doing the best I can, man.
Can't you take it easy?

398
00:39:14,144 --> 00:39:17,396
Hey, I told you not to beat your
schlong last night. It drains your power.

399
00:39:19,107 --> 00:39:20,190
Straighten up, Glazer.

400
00:39:20,191 --> 00:39:22,568
When Glazer straightens up, Sally,
you better run.

401
00:39:39,794 --> 00:39:42,796
- Michelle, control your campers.
- Todd!

402
00:39:50,138 --> 00:39:51,722
Come on, you guys.

403
00:39:53,641 --> 00:39:55,851
We're canoeing, not showering.

404
00:40:25,423 --> 00:40:29,051
There was a camp not far from here,
just across the lake.

405
00:40:30,470 --> 00:40:32,596
It was called Camp Blackfoot.

406
00:40:33,223 --> 00:40:37,142
No one goes there anymore.
Everything burned down.

407
00:40:37,519 --> 00:40:40,437
There's nothing left, except the ruins.

408
00:40:41,856 --> 00:40:45,734
Now this camp had a caretaker,
a really evil bastard.

409
00:40:46,611 --> 00:40:48,987
And his name was Cropsy.

410
00:40:51,533 --> 00:40:55,452
Everyone hated Cropsy.
For a start, he was a drunk.

411
00:40:56,121 --> 00:40:58,122
Two bottles of whisky a day, no problem.

412
00:40:58,123 --> 00:41:01,708
Like, most of the time he was
somewhere out in space,

413
00:41:01,709 --> 00:41:04,878
but if he caught you, look out!

414
00:41:06,339 --> 00:41:10,175
Because Cropsy could strip the paint
off the walls,

415
00:41:10,176 --> 00:41:12,219
just by breathing on them.

416
00:41:15,557 --> 00:41:17,724
Now this Cropsy was a sadist.

417
00:41:18,351 --> 00:41:23,021
I mean, he got real pleasure
out of hurting people, scaring them.

418
00:41:24,274 --> 00:41:28,777
And he had these garden shears,
you know?

419
00:41:29,237 --> 00:41:32,114
The kind with long thin blades.

420
00:41:33,074 --> 00:41:36,243
And he carried them all the time,
wherever he went.

421
00:41:36,703 --> 00:41:40,080
And he had this kind of demonic way
of looking at you.

422
00:41:40,748 --> 00:41:44,460
One time, this Cropsy really went after
this kid from Brooklyn.

423
00:41:45,044 --> 00:41:49,506
Followed him around night and day.
He made this kid's life a living hell.

424
00:41:50,341 --> 00:41:52,718
But this time he chose the wrong guy.

425
00:41:53,261 --> 00:41:56,096
Because the kid and some of his buddies
had planned a little prank

426
00:41:56,097 --> 00:41:59,141
that would scare the living shit
out of Cropsy.

427
00:41:59,767 --> 00:42:03,562
Only problem was, the gag went wrong.

428
00:42:04,314 --> 00:42:08,484
The next thing anyone knows, Cropsy's
trapped alive and burning in his bunk.

429
00:42:08,485 --> 00:42:11,570
They try to get him out but the fire's
so fierce they can't reach him.

430
00:42:11,571 --> 00:42:15,491
All they can do is stand outside,
and listen to him cry out in agony.

431
00:42:15,492 --> 00:42:19,578
They say he smashed his way through
the bunkroom door, just a mass of flames.

432
00:42:19,579 --> 00:42:24,249
And as he screamed out, burned alive,
he cried out,

433
00:42:24,250 --> 00:42:27,961
"I will return. I will have my revenge."

434
00:42:31,007 --> 00:42:35,511
They never found his body. He survived.

435
00:42:36,930 --> 00:42:41,225
He lives on whatever he can catch.
Eats them raw.

436
00:42:41,726 --> 00:42:45,938
Alive. No longer human.

437
00:42:47,857 --> 00:42:50,943
Right now, he's out there.

438
00:42:52,070 --> 00:42:56,114
Watching. Waiting.

439
00:42:56,115 --> 00:42:58,909
Don't look, he'll see you.

440
00:42:59,494 --> 00:43:03,372
Don't move, he'll hear you.

441
00:43:05,124 --> 00:43:07,459
Don't breathe...

442
00:43:07,835 --> 00:43:09,211
You're dead!

443
00:43:13,925 --> 00:43:15,133
Oh, shit!

444
00:43:24,269 --> 00:43:26,103
You asshole, Eddy.

445
00:43:26,104 --> 00:43:27,896
- Real funny, man.
- You freak.

446
00:43:27,897 --> 00:43:30,274
You motherfucker!

447
00:43:47,208 --> 00:43:48,584
You know,
that little joke you played

448
00:43:48,585 --> 00:43:50,752
back at the campfire wasn't very funny.

449
00:43:50,753 --> 00:43:54,381
- You don't think so?
- Not that you scared me, but...

450
00:43:54,382 --> 00:43:55,966
No, of course not.

451
00:43:56,801 --> 00:43:59,261
Eddy, is there really a Cropsy maniac?

452
00:43:59,262 --> 00:44:02,180
Sure there is. He's from my neighborhood.

453
00:44:02,682 --> 00:44:05,684
Know what he does?
He takes paper bags, see?

454
00:44:05,685 --> 00:44:08,437
He fills them with dog shit,
then he lights them

455
00:44:08,605 --> 00:44:11,148
and leaves them in front of somebody's
door and when they open the door,

456
00:44:11,149 --> 00:44:12,691
they go like that.

457
00:44:15,361 --> 00:44:19,156
- You're crazy.
- Yeah, I know. Crazy for you.

458
00:44:24,787 --> 00:44:27,539
I can't figure you out, you know.

459
00:44:28,249 --> 00:44:30,876
I mean, first you tell me you like me,
and then 10 seconds later

460
00:44:30,877 --> 00:44:33,253
you're looking off here, looking off there,
like you don't even know who I am.

461
00:44:33,254 --> 00:44:37,174
- I do like you, Eddy. But...
- But what?

462
00:44:37,467 --> 00:44:40,177
You're always talking about
how many women you've had.

463
00:44:40,178 --> 00:44:42,929
I don't want to be just another statistic.

464
00:44:42,930 --> 00:44:45,057
Karen, knock it off, will you?

465
00:44:45,725 --> 00:44:48,727
Come on, if two people like each other,

466
00:44:49,228 --> 00:44:51,688
if they want each other, so you do it.

467
00:44:51,981 --> 00:44:53,857
What's wrong with that?

468
00:44:54,651 --> 00:44:57,653
We like each other, right? And we're alone.

469
00:44:58,696 --> 00:45:02,783
You can't blame me for trying, can you?
Come on, what do you say?

470
00:45:03,660 --> 00:45:05,952
- Maybe.
- Maybe.

471
00:45:06,537 --> 00:45:08,789
- All right, let's take a swim.
- What? Now?

472
00:45:08,790 --> 00:45:09,790
I haven't got a swimsuit.

473
00:45:09,874 --> 00:45:12,250
So, who needs a bathing suit?
Who's gonna see you here?

474
00:45:13,503 --> 00:45:14,711
You.

475
00:45:21,552 --> 00:45:24,262
You're free to do what you want.
I'm taking a dip.

476
00:45:24,263 --> 00:45:26,556
- Eddy?
- What?

477
00:45:27,058 --> 00:45:28,058
Promise?

478
00:45:28,976 --> 00:45:32,896
Hey, relax.

479
00:45:33,189 --> 00:45:35,857
Just going to take a quiet swim around
and head back to the camp.

480
00:45:37,985 --> 00:45:39,236
Come on.

481
00:46:02,176 --> 00:46:03,844
Oh, this is great!

482
00:46:05,638 --> 00:46:08,140
You gotta come in. This is the best.

483
00:46:20,611 --> 00:46:23,029
- It's nice?
- It's freezing.

484
00:46:23,030 --> 00:46:25,282
Come here, I'll warm you up.

485
00:46:33,666 --> 00:46:34,666
Eddy.

486
00:46:35,501 --> 00:46:37,669
Don't fight it, don't fight it.

487
00:46:40,965 --> 00:46:43,759
You're not gonna start that now, are you?

488
00:46:48,556 --> 00:46:49,765
Eddy!

489
00:46:49,766 --> 00:46:52,142
Come on,
you gonna start that again, now?

490
00:46:55,897 --> 00:46:57,397
Cut it out, Eddy.

491
00:46:58,566 --> 00:47:00,776
Why'd you come out here, then?

492
00:47:03,905 --> 00:47:05,405
You promised!

493
00:47:05,907 --> 00:47:07,866
Get the fuck out of my face.

494
00:47:27,303 --> 00:47:28,261
Fuck!

495
00:47:36,437 --> 00:47:38,855
Oh, no! Where are my clothes?

496
00:47:51,118 --> 00:47:53,119
Come on, you guys.

497
00:47:56,165 --> 00:47:57,415
Come on.

498
00:48:02,797 --> 00:48:04,756
Where are my clothes?

499
00:48:06,008 --> 00:48:07,425
Come on, please?

500
00:48:12,223 --> 00:48:13,390
Oh, no.

501
00:49:53,866 --> 00:49:55,617
- Okay, Eddy, wake up.
- Get up.

502
00:49:55,618 --> 00:49:57,243
- Wake up.
- Where's Karen?

503
00:49:57,244 --> 00:49:59,079
- What do you mean?
- You know what he means.

504
00:49:59,080 --> 00:50:01,414
- Where's Karen?
- How should I know where she is?

505
00:50:01,415 --> 00:50:03,249
- You were with her last night, remember?
- So what?

506
00:50:03,250 --> 00:50:04,751
So she never came back.

507
00:50:04,752 --> 00:50:06,878
I didn't look for her
because I figured she was with you.

508
00:50:06,879 --> 00:50:08,088
Shit.

509
00:50:08,089 --> 00:50:10,215
So where is she, Eddy? Come on, get up.

510
00:50:10,216 --> 00:50:13,593
Hey, what the hell is this?
Some sort of interrogation here?

511
00:50:13,594 --> 00:50:15,637
Don't give me that! Where is she?

512
00:50:15,638 --> 00:50:17,347
All right. Okay.

513
00:50:18,057 --> 00:50:20,016
Hey, Karen!

514
00:50:20,393 --> 00:50:22,143
Cut the act, Eddy.

515
00:50:22,520 --> 00:50:24,771
We've already looked all over.
She's not here.

516
00:50:24,772 --> 00:50:27,273
Are you sure you didn't go
just a little too far?

517
00:50:27,274 --> 00:50:28,441
Hey, take it easy?

518
00:50:28,442 --> 00:50:31,236
"Take it easy"!
Christ, you guys make me sick.

519
00:50:32,613 --> 00:50:35,323
You know, Karen told me
she was really scared of you.

520
00:50:35,324 --> 00:50:37,784
Oh, yeah, she was scared of me, huh?
Then how come

521
00:50:37,785 --> 00:50:39,369
- she went with me last night?
- I don't know.

522
00:50:39,370 --> 00:50:41,037
Maybe it's because she likes you,
you dumb bastard.

523
00:50:41,038 --> 00:50:42,789
Now tell me, what happened?

524
00:50:42,790 --> 00:50:44,541
- Come here, will you?
- What?

525
00:50:46,252 --> 00:50:50,338
Look, all right, I must have come on
a little strong, okay?

526
00:50:50,339 --> 00:50:53,258
Came down here, went swimming,
and I don't know, she...

527
00:50:53,259 --> 00:50:55,176
- Look, what did she do?
- She didn't do anything.

528
00:50:55,177 --> 00:50:57,137
She called me a few names,
swam back to shore,

529
00:50:57,138 --> 00:50:58,979
and I figured she went back
with everyone else.

530
00:50:59,056 --> 00:51:00,265
You jerk!

531
00:51:02,143 --> 00:51:04,269
Michelle! Hey, Michelle.

532
00:51:04,270 --> 00:51:05,854
The canoes are gone.

533
00:51:05,855 --> 00:51:07,480
What do you mean, they're gone?

534
00:51:07,481 --> 00:51:09,399
They're gone. They're not here.

535
00:51:13,279 --> 00:51:14,654
Karen.

536
00:51:14,655 --> 00:51:17,449
- Why would she take the canoes?
- She might have let them go accidentally.

537
00:51:17,450 --> 00:51:18,491
Why?

538
00:51:18,492 --> 00:51:20,160
Because the supervisor
gave her permission

539
00:51:20,161 --> 00:51:22,829
to go back to camp if things got too heavy.

540
00:51:22,830 --> 00:51:26,374
Oh, come on, will you?
We had a fight. Nothing serious.

541
00:51:26,375 --> 00:51:28,418
She's gonna let all the canoes go?

542
00:51:28,627 --> 00:51:30,503
For Christ's sake.

543
00:51:31,088 --> 00:51:32,964
Okay. So they had a fight.

544
00:51:32,965 --> 00:51:35,675
She took one of the canoes back to the
main camp, but where are the other five?

545
00:51:35,676 --> 00:51:37,135
I don't know.

546
00:51:37,136 --> 00:51:39,804
Maybe the kids are just pulling a prank.

547
00:51:42,391 --> 00:51:43,475
Marnie!

548
00:51:43,476 --> 00:51:46,853
Get all the kids together
to where the canoes were moored.

549
00:51:46,854 --> 00:51:47,937
Okay!

550
00:52:02,244 --> 00:52:04,579
Okay, okay. Quiet, quiet.

551
00:52:04,580 --> 00:52:07,540
I'm not kidding now. Does anyone know
what happened to the canoes?

552
00:52:07,541 --> 00:52:10,668
Oh, yeah, Dave sold them
to some Indian guy.

553
00:52:10,669 --> 00:52:13,338
Come on, you guys, this could be serious.

554
00:52:13,339 --> 00:52:15,381
Yeah, they can't just vanish.
I want them found.

555
00:52:16,133 --> 00:52:19,010
There's your answer,
sitting right over there.

556
00:52:20,179 --> 00:52:22,806
What'd you do with the goddamn canoes,
you little freak?

557
00:52:23,265 --> 00:52:25,058
Look, I don't know
what you're talking about.

558
00:52:25,059 --> 00:52:27,435
Yeah, I bet you don't know
what we're talking about?

559
00:52:27,436 --> 00:52:30,105
Glazer, why don't you lay off him?
He doesn't know anything about it.

560
00:52:30,106 --> 00:52:31,815
Yeah, cut it out, Glazer.

561
00:52:35,277 --> 00:52:36,653
Look, here's what we're gonna do, okay?

562
00:52:36,654 --> 00:52:38,863
We're gonna split up
and search this whole area.

563
00:52:38,864 --> 00:52:39,989
They gotta be around here somewhere.

564
00:52:39,990 --> 00:52:42,534
What happens if we don't find them?

565
00:52:42,535 --> 00:52:45,453
I don't know.
We'll build a raft or something.

566
00:52:45,996 --> 00:52:47,831
Why don't we just walk back?

567
00:52:48,707 --> 00:52:50,542
Michelle, take a look around.

568
00:52:50,918 --> 00:52:52,710
It's thick forest for miles.

569
00:52:53,504 --> 00:52:56,506
No, we need those canoes.
Okay, come on, let's start looking.

570
00:52:56,924 --> 00:52:58,341
Come on, it will be fun.

571
00:52:58,884 --> 00:53:00,718
- I'm looking forward to it?
- Come on.

572
00:53:00,719 --> 00:53:02,846
- Come on, it will be fun.
- Yes.

573
00:53:03,305 --> 00:53:05,431
- Better lay off the girl.
- Okay.

574
00:53:05,432 --> 00:53:06,975
Come on, chief.

575
00:53:15,609 --> 00:53:18,736
- What are you thinking?
- I don't know.

576
00:53:19,446 --> 00:53:21,364
I just feel real uneasy.

577
00:53:21,782 --> 00:53:23,032
About Karen.

578
00:53:23,868 --> 00:53:25,618
Yeah, something's wrong.

579
00:53:26,453 --> 00:53:28,997
There's no way
all those canoes can just disappear

580
00:53:28,998 --> 00:53:33,042
and Karen wouldn't go back to
the main camp in the middle of the night.

581
00:53:34,253 --> 00:53:36,880
Well, what are we going to do
if we don't find the canoes?

582
00:53:36,881 --> 00:53:39,299
Are we really going to build a raft?

583
00:53:39,967 --> 00:53:41,467
We're gonna have to.

584
00:53:44,680 --> 00:53:47,098
Man, what the hell are we supposed to
be looking for, anyway?

585
00:53:47,099 --> 00:53:48,808
- Your mother!
- Your mother!

586
00:53:48,809 --> 00:53:50,643
Hey, guys, here's a piece of wood.

587
00:53:50,644 --> 00:53:55,064
I still don't understand how Todd expects
us to build a raft with all this stuff.

588
00:53:55,065 --> 00:53:57,025
Hey, Dave.
You know, you've never failed us.

589
00:53:57,026 --> 00:53:59,444
How about a big speedboat with
a Merkel engine on the back?

590
00:53:59,445 --> 00:54:01,237
Oh, why, certainly!

591
00:54:02,531 --> 00:54:05,283
- Hey, what about this?
- What about that?

592
00:54:05,284 --> 00:54:07,952
What do you expect?
This looks like a houseboat for ants.

593
00:54:07,953 --> 00:54:10,121
- It floats.
- It floats?

594
00:54:10,122 --> 00:54:11,414
- Dave.
- I told you.

595
00:54:11,415 --> 00:54:13,291
Come, Jane. We seek wood.

596
00:54:13,834 --> 00:54:15,919
- Come on.
- Come on, you guys.

597
00:54:17,046 --> 00:54:20,256
Mad at me, Sally.
I mean, shit, I try to be nice.

598
00:54:20,257 --> 00:54:22,175
I asked you to go swimming with me.
You wouldn't go.

599
00:54:22,176 --> 00:54:23,927
And then on the canoe ride,
you wouldn't even go with me.

600
00:54:23,928 --> 00:54:25,595
- There's a piece of wood.
- What's the matter?

601
00:54:25,596 --> 00:54:27,347
You won't even talk to me?
What do I got to do?

602
00:54:27,348 --> 00:54:29,265
- I mean, what do I gotta do?
- Glazer.

603
00:54:29,266 --> 00:54:32,936
- What's the matter?
- Just cool your engines.

604
00:54:33,562 --> 00:54:35,355
Come on, we're meant to be
looking for wood.

605
00:54:35,356 --> 00:54:36,439
Yeah, right.

606
00:54:37,149 --> 00:54:38,441
Glazer, no!

607
00:54:42,238 --> 00:54:44,739
Go ahead. Shit!

608
00:54:45,241 --> 00:54:46,991
You're something, ain't you?

609
00:54:47,326 --> 00:54:50,036
- Hey, Eddy throw me over that rope?
- All right.

610
00:54:50,037 --> 00:54:51,788
This is going to take
longer than you think.

611
00:54:51,789 --> 00:54:53,909
We'll be okay as long as
they leave by this afternoon.

612
00:54:54,083 --> 00:54:56,042
Hey, guys. Look what I found.

613
00:54:56,043 --> 00:54:57,418
- Oh, great!
- Oh, good.

614
00:54:57,419 --> 00:54:59,712
Eddy, give her a hand.
Take it over to the pile?

615
00:54:59,713 --> 00:55:01,506
- All right.
- Here you go.

616
00:55:19,566 --> 00:55:20,942
No, Glazer! No!

617
00:55:20,943 --> 00:55:23,194
- What's the matter?
- Not here!

618
00:55:23,195 --> 00:55:25,238
What's the matter now?
You know you want to.

619
00:55:25,239 --> 00:55:27,323
Later... Maybe.

620
00:55:29,618 --> 00:55:31,786
- You mean that?
- Sure.

621
00:55:33,080 --> 00:55:34,289
That a girl, Sally.

622
00:55:34,290 --> 00:55:36,332
Listen, you can trust me, you hear?

623
00:55:36,959 --> 00:55:38,918
It's gonna be real good.

624
00:55:39,461 --> 00:55:41,170
Real good, I promise.

625
00:55:58,731 --> 00:56:00,606
Okay, kids, listen up. Eddy's in charge.

626
00:56:00,607 --> 00:56:01,607
All right, Eddy!

627
00:56:01,608 --> 00:56:03,818
Okay? He'll get you back
to the main camp.

628
00:56:03,819 --> 00:56:06,404
Eddy, no side trips.
Straight back to camp, right?

629
00:56:06,405 --> 00:56:09,324
- No lefts, no rights, straight ahead.
- Remember, it's just like paddling a canoe.

630
00:56:09,325 --> 00:56:11,868
Try to make good time
so you get there before dark.

631
00:56:11,869 --> 00:56:13,328
You call this a paddle?
This is an eggbeater.

632
00:56:13,329 --> 00:56:15,872
If we're not back by tomorrow,
send in the Marines.

633
00:56:16,957 --> 00:56:19,584
All right, here we go. Bon voyage!

634
00:56:31,638 --> 00:56:36,976
Come on, paddle together!
Paddle together!

635
00:56:39,730 --> 00:56:42,565
I'll be 84 by the time you get help here.

636
00:56:42,566 --> 00:56:44,484
- Goodbye!
- Goodbye!

637
00:57:07,341 --> 00:57:09,092
Come on, dig in. Dig in.

638
00:57:10,052 --> 00:57:11,803
- I'm tired.
- I'm tired.

639
00:57:11,804 --> 00:57:13,888
What do you mean you're tired?
We're doing all the work up here.

640
00:57:13,889 --> 00:57:15,014
Shut up, Woodstock!

641
00:57:15,182 --> 00:57:18,309
Hey, hey, hey!
Will you all please shut the fuck up

642
00:57:18,310 --> 00:57:21,437
- and just keep paddling. Okay?
- All right.

643
00:57:21,438 --> 00:57:23,356
Let's go.

644
00:57:23,357 --> 00:57:26,651
- Eddy? Eddy?
- What?

645
00:57:27,569 --> 00:57:29,821
How come Karen left, really?

646
00:57:29,822 --> 00:57:34,784
Hey, look, it's like Michelle said, okay?
She was upset about something, all right?

647
00:57:39,873 --> 00:57:41,541
Come on.

648
00:57:41,542 --> 00:57:44,085
- Hey, you guys! Look over there!
- What?

649
00:57:44,086 --> 00:57:45,670
- It's one of our canoes! It is, it's ours!
- It is!

650
00:57:45,671 --> 00:57:47,171
- One of our canoes!
- No, it isn't.

651
00:57:47,172 --> 00:57:48,506
- It is, too.
- It's gotta be.

652
00:57:48,507 --> 00:57:50,883
Yeah, who else would be stupid enough
to lose it?

653
00:57:50,884 --> 00:57:54,137
- Come on!
- Dig in there. Let's go!

654
00:57:56,557 --> 00:57:59,725
Come on, Eddy, strong man, let's go.

655
00:57:59,726 --> 00:58:01,561
- Just keep going.
- I'm paddling, I'm paddling.

656
00:58:01,562 --> 00:58:03,729
- Let's go, Eddy.
- Let's go!

657
00:58:03,730 --> 00:58:06,357
Man, that looks like...

658
00:58:06,650 --> 00:58:08,734
- All right.
- There's some of that muscle.

659
00:58:08,735 --> 00:58:10,528
Hurry up, let's get ahead.

660
00:58:20,456 --> 00:58:23,416
- Come on!
- I'm coming.

661
00:58:38,807 --> 00:58:42,185
- Here we go, Fish.
- I'm going. I got seaweed on here.

662
00:58:43,437 --> 00:58:45,938
Don't worry about that,
we'll have a canoe!

663
00:58:47,107 --> 00:58:49,901
- I can't believe it!
- Eddy, Eddy!

664
00:58:49,902 --> 00:58:52,403
Get ready to grab it, man.
I'm going on board.

665
00:59:03,123 --> 00:59:05,041
- Woody, get ready to grab it.
- All right.

666
00:59:05,042 --> 00:59:07,168
We're going to go on,
so you got to get ready to hold on.

667
00:59:07,169 --> 00:59:08,127
All right.

668
00:59:52,548 --> 00:59:56,551
God, look at this.
We really could get lost so easily here.

669
00:59:57,177 --> 00:59:59,095
That's kind of what I was hoping for.

670
00:59:59,763 --> 01:00:01,389
Get out.

671
01:00:03,016 --> 01:00:05,560
Do you think those kids got back all right?

672
01:00:05,561 --> 01:00:07,520
Probably back right now.

673
01:00:08,897 --> 01:00:10,481
- I hope so.
- Come on, don't worry about them.

674
01:00:10,482 --> 01:00:11,774
Let's go.

675
01:00:11,775 --> 01:00:14,193
Come on, it's gonna get dark soon.

676
01:00:17,864 --> 01:00:19,365
Easy does it.

677
01:00:26,623 --> 01:00:28,416
Those kids really had fun today, though.

678
01:00:28,417 --> 01:00:33,004
I know. Look, the way we built that raft,

679
01:00:33,005 --> 01:00:36,048
- they're probably safer than we are.
- I was impressed.

680
01:00:39,469 --> 01:00:41,512
Where did you learn to build a raft?

681
01:00:42,097 --> 01:00:43,973
Raft building, in the Boy Scouts.

682
01:00:45,225 --> 01:00:47,226
Thank God for the Boy Scouts.

683
01:00:48,395 --> 01:00:50,771
- I've been wondering...
- About what?

684
01:00:52,232 --> 01:00:55,401
Well, about whether

685
01:00:55,402 --> 01:00:57,820
you're ticklish!

686
01:01:08,957 --> 01:01:12,251
Come on, we better get back
before it gets dark?

687
01:01:12,252 --> 01:01:14,128
I've got a better idea.

688
01:01:24,931 --> 01:01:26,349
Glazer!

689
01:01:26,350 --> 01:01:28,643
Don't you think we shouldn't be
so far away from the others?

690
01:01:28,644 --> 01:01:30,645
Trust me, baby. Trust me. It's okay.

691
01:01:31,188 --> 01:01:32,897
It's okay.

692
01:01:35,108 --> 01:01:37,026
Easy, Glazer, please.

693
01:01:37,027 --> 01:01:40,571
Relax, baby. Be good, it's gonna be good.
Trust me.

694
01:01:40,989 --> 01:01:43,199
- Relax.
- Easy.

695
01:01:43,950 --> 01:01:45,618
Stop!

696
01:01:47,412 --> 01:01:48,746
Hold still.

697
01:02:05,597 --> 01:02:08,724
- Shit!
- That's all?

698
01:02:10,811 --> 01:02:11,977
Is it?

699
01:02:14,106 --> 01:02:15,314
I'm sorry, Sally.

700
01:02:15,315 --> 01:02:17,233
- I don't know what happened.
- It's okay.

701
01:02:17,818 --> 01:02:19,652
It'll be better next time, baby. Trust me.

702
01:02:19,653 --> 01:02:21,487
"Trust me, baby."

703
01:02:23,740 --> 01:02:24,907
Sally?

704
01:02:26,493 --> 01:02:28,577
- You're cold?
- Yes.

705
01:02:30,205 --> 01:02:32,790
You didn't do too much to warm me up.

706
01:02:33,792 --> 01:02:36,544
So, I guess you wanna go back, is that it?

707
01:02:40,006 --> 01:02:41,340
No.

708
01:02:43,802 --> 01:02:46,345
Why don't we stay? We might...

709
01:02:49,224 --> 01:02:51,809
What are you saying? You mean that?

710
01:02:52,561 --> 01:02:54,562
Do you really mean that?

711
01:02:56,356 --> 01:02:57,648
I guess so.

712
01:03:02,195 --> 01:03:03,529
That's a girl.

713
01:03:12,330 --> 01:03:14,290
Hey, wanna know something?

714
01:03:14,875 --> 01:03:17,501
I'm gonna sneak on back to the campsite.

715
01:03:17,502 --> 01:03:19,253
Get some matches.

716
01:03:19,254 --> 01:03:21,839
Come back here and build us a hot fire.

717
01:03:22,174 --> 01:03:24,091
What do you think about that?

718
01:03:27,095 --> 01:03:30,431
- Don't be long.
- Not a second longer than I gotta be.

719
01:03:41,902 --> 01:03:45,154
Listen, you stay warm, you hear?
Because I'm coming right back.

720
01:04:27,989 --> 01:04:30,574
No, please, no! No!

721
01:05:57,537 --> 01:05:58,829
Sally?

722
01:05:59,623 --> 01:06:01,624
Sorry it took so long, babe.

723
01:06:02,542 --> 01:06:03,459
Hey, Sally?

724
01:06:04,085 --> 01:06:07,129
Hey, listen now,
you playing hide and seek?

725
01:06:11,551 --> 01:06:12,927
Peekaboo!

726
01:07:09,317 --> 01:07:12,069
Todd, Todd. You gotta wake up.
You gotta wake up.

727
01:07:13,279 --> 01:07:15,739
- Now, come on. Hurry up. Wake up.
- Come on, Alfred.

728
01:07:15,740 --> 01:07:17,950
No, come on, hurry.
You gotta wake up now, come on.

729
01:07:17,951 --> 01:07:20,536
- What time is it?
- Look, I couldn't help it.

730
01:07:20,537 --> 01:07:23,205
It happened so fast, it was like...
He was out.

731
01:07:23,206 --> 01:07:27,042
He was out and...
And he was on top of him in a second.

732
01:07:27,043 --> 01:07:30,921
I was... I didn't know.
I was following and he...

733
01:07:31,673 --> 01:07:34,508
Look... Glazer's dead.

734
01:07:36,803 --> 01:07:39,596
- What the fuck are you talking about?
- No, no, really.

735
01:07:39,597 --> 01:07:41,306
- I saw him. I saw him kill Glazer.
- Look, would you be quiet?

736
01:07:41,307 --> 01:07:44,101
- You're going to wake everybody up.
- The same guy at the window...

737
01:07:44,102 --> 01:07:45,269
That I saw at the window.

738
01:07:45,270 --> 01:07:47,104
Remember? I told him about
the guy at the window.

739
01:07:47,105 --> 01:07:48,731
- What guy?
- The burned face.

740
01:07:51,401 --> 01:07:52,693
He's dead.

741
01:07:56,281 --> 01:07:58,991
Alfred, if this is another one of your
tricks, you know, I'm not really...

742
01:07:58,992 --> 01:08:00,242
You don't believe me.

743
01:08:00,618 --> 01:08:02,578
You're just like the others,
you don't believe me.

744
01:08:02,829 --> 01:08:04,997
- I'm telling you, I saw him.
- Would you be quiet?

745
01:08:05,749 --> 01:08:07,916
I'll go with you, all right? Okay?

746
01:08:12,797 --> 01:08:13,964
Come on.

747
01:08:32,233 --> 01:08:33,525
Oh, my God.

748
01:08:38,198 --> 01:08:39,281
Todd!

749
01:09:49,561 --> 01:09:51,103
What do you see?

750
01:09:51,104 --> 01:09:52,980
- It's a raft.
- It's a raft.

751
01:09:52,981 --> 01:09:53,939
I don't know.

752
01:09:55,441 --> 01:09:57,442
- I know.
- What are they doing?

753
01:09:57,443 --> 01:09:59,611
Now, why would they get off the raft?

754
01:10:00,780 --> 01:10:02,865
You guys are really falling for this,
aren't you?

755
01:10:02,866 --> 01:10:03,949
For what?

756
01:10:03,950 --> 01:10:07,244
I mean, you still don't realize we got
Ringling Brothers out there.

757
01:10:07,245 --> 01:10:09,621
Hey, Eddy! You guys!

758
01:10:09,622 --> 01:10:12,249
All right, come on. Enough is enough?

759
01:10:12,250 --> 01:10:14,459
Come on, bring it in, you guys.

760
01:10:14,460 --> 01:10:16,628
This is ridiculous.
Come on, come on, come on. Let's go.

761
01:10:16,629 --> 01:10:19,464
- Dave, wait. Stay, I want to go in.
- Hey, can we go in?

762
01:10:19,465 --> 01:10:22,050
No, just stay here okay.
Let me check it out.

763
01:10:22,594 --> 01:10:24,553
Okay, we'll stay here.

764
01:10:24,554 --> 01:10:27,556
You guys are in trouble.
Counselor coming.

765
01:10:57,337 --> 01:11:00,088
Hey, Dave, what do you really
think is happening?

766
01:11:00,673 --> 01:11:03,175
I don't know. Am I swimming out there?
Hang on a minute.

767
01:11:12,352 --> 01:11:13,810
Is Alfred there?

768
01:11:13,811 --> 01:11:15,145
- Hey, there's Todd.
- Where?

769
01:11:15,146 --> 01:11:16,480
Hey, Todd!

770
01:11:16,481 --> 01:11:19,149
Todd.

771
01:11:23,696 --> 01:11:25,739
Can you do something about the raft?

772
01:11:31,621 --> 01:11:34,039
Stay! Stay here!

773
01:11:45,385 --> 01:11:48,178
I know we're gonna die, for real.

774
01:11:49,889 --> 01:11:51,473
We'll never get back.

775
01:12:00,984 --> 01:12:04,736
Just get back to camp and get me
some help. That's all I want you to do.

776
01:12:04,904 --> 01:12:06,905
Just get me some help.

777
01:12:08,574 --> 01:12:11,159
All right, come on, come on.

778
01:13:12,972 --> 01:13:14,139
Alfred!

779
01:13:48,132 --> 01:13:50,550
Michelle, I'm so tired.
I can't paddle anymore.

780
01:13:50,551 --> 01:13:55,180
Paddle! Now, we're almost there.
What do you want to do, stop right now?

781
01:13:56,766 --> 01:13:59,309
Deep down there you can do it. Come on.

782
01:13:59,936 --> 01:14:01,603
You can do it.

783
01:14:04,232 --> 01:14:06,274
- Come on.
- Let's go.

784
01:14:24,961 --> 01:14:25,461
Alfred!

785
01:14:38,099 --> 01:14:38,599
Todd?

786
01:14:52,447 --> 01:14:53,822
Grab this pole.

787
01:14:56,075 --> 01:14:58,243
Come on, just another inch. Pull it.

788
01:15:01,122 --> 01:15:03,081
What's with the raft?
Where are my canoes?

789
01:15:03,082 --> 01:15:04,458
Jeff, where's the outboard?

790
01:15:04,459 --> 01:15:06,918
What do you want with the outboard?

791
01:15:16,345 --> 01:15:18,847
Listen to me. There is a killer out there.

792
01:15:18,848 --> 01:15:21,349
Oh, come on, Michelle.
Todd put you up to this?

793
01:15:21,350 --> 01:15:23,101
God damn it! Look at those kids!

794
01:16:14,403 --> 01:16:16,071
Can't we go any faster?

795
01:16:16,239 --> 01:16:18,490
It's a small motor, Michelle.
It won't go any faster.

796
01:16:19,575 --> 01:16:21,326
How long before the police get there?

797
01:16:21,327 --> 01:16:23,119
Oh, God, I hope they're there.

798
01:16:23,120 --> 01:16:24,829
They said they were going by helicopter.

799
01:17:51,584 --> 01:17:53,543
Help! Help!

800
01:20:07,636 --> 01:20:08,803
Alfred?

801
01:20:10,389 --> 01:20:11,598
Alfred!

802
01:20:45,633 --> 01:20:46,591
Alfred.

803
01:22:14,054 --> 01:22:16,347
Cropsy's going to get
what he deserves.

804
01:22:16,348 --> 01:22:18,683
If we pull this off,
it'll be the biggest number

805
01:22:18,684 --> 01:22:20,435
Camp Blackfoot has ever seen.

806
01:22:22,980 --> 01:22:26,524
Tonight's the night
that we scare the shit out of Cropsy.

807
01:22:29,987 --> 01:22:32,280
- Jamie, you with us?
- Yeah, sure.

808
01:22:32,698 --> 01:22:33,781
- Snoop?
- I'm in.

809
01:22:36,285 --> 01:22:38,536
- Billy?
- I can't stand the son of a bitch.

810
01:22:39,163 --> 01:22:40,914
What about you, Todd?

811
01:23:47,272 --> 01:23:48,439
Alfred?

812
01:23:49,942 --> 01:23:51,025
Alfred.

813
01:25:04,600 --> 01:25:05,808
Todd!

814
01:25:11,982 --> 01:25:12,982
Todd.

815
01:25:21,700 --> 01:25:22,992
Todd!

816
01:25:22,993 --> 01:25:24,327
Alfred!

817
01:26:56,461 --> 01:26:57,712
Alfred, get out!

818
01:27:31,830 --> 01:27:33,372
Let's go.

819
01:28:02,319 --> 01:28:04,320
They never found
his body but they say

820
01:28:05,364 --> 01:28:08,532
his spirit lives in the forest.

821
01:28:10,077 --> 01:28:11,452
This forest.

822
01:28:12,329 --> 01:28:15,748
A maniac, a thing no longer human.

823
01:28:16,667 --> 01:28:18,376
They say

824
01:28:18,377 --> 01:28:21,337
he lives on whatever he can catch.

825
01:28:21,338 --> 01:28:23,339
Eats them raw, alive maybe.

826
01:28:24,841 --> 01:28:28,886
And every year
he picks on a summer camp

827
01:28:30,097 --> 01:28:33,391
and seeks his revenge
for the terrible things

828
01:28:34,268 --> 01:28:36,018
those kids did to him.

829
01:28:37,562 --> 01:28:39,313
Every year he kills.

830
01:28:41,275 --> 01:28:44,402
Right now, he's out there. Watching.

831
01:28:45,904 --> 01:28:47,113
Waiting.

832
01:28:48,573 --> 01:28:51,867
So don't look, he'll see you.

833
01:28:51,868 --> 01:28:53,828
Don't breathe, he'll hear you.

834
01:28:56,081 --> 01:28:58,249
Don't move, you're dead!
