1
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:42,609
Wait!

2
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:46,858
Stop!

3
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:52,090
Please wait!

4
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:57,534
Stop!

5
00:03:57,220 --> 00:03:59,893
Is anyone home?

6
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:29,694
Is there anyone home?

7
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:37,929
Can I come in?

8
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:48,973
Please, I am a foreigner.

9
00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:50,614
And I'm lost.

10
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:06,856
I know someone's there.

11
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:10,809
Hello?

12
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:23,932
Please, I need help.

13
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:34,858
This is completely new for me, professor.

14
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:37,016
I simply can't imagine
how a expert on insects...

15
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:39,489
...could be so helpful for the police.

16
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:44,011
Would you please explain that
more detailled.

17
00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:46,938
Of course. You can't see the
connections on first sight.

18
00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:50,928
When I decided to specialize
in animal cadavers, ...

19
00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:52,817
...I did not have the least idea of that.

20
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:54,134
John, do I really have to listen to that again?

21
00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:58,372
Oh yes, just as you had to
on the first murder case.

22
00:07:58,540 --> 00:08:00,735
You came to me because
you did not know how to go on.

23
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:03,977
We solved the case together.

24
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:09,419
When a dead body is exposed to nature
it will be eaten by insects sooner or later.

25
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:13,010
You naughty girl

26
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:17,697
Where did you find that?

27
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:20,254
You could hurt yourself.

28
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:23,571
It is sharp.

29
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:26,891
It is not a toy.

30
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:33,932
Outside?

31
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:38,372
And who, may I ask, put it out there?

32
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:44,337
Don't you ever play with this again.

33
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:52,214
I forgot to introduce you... this is Inga.

34
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:54,814
She's my nurse.

35
00:08:54,940 --> 00:08:58,728
If I pick out something with
my laser she'll bring it to me.

36
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:03,736
She's also my friend, too.

37
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:05,970
Aren't you?

38
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:10,652
But she is a very good nurse.

39
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:13,818
Cadaver-eating insects are
divided into eight groups.

40
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:17,774
These eight groups of insects come
to the corpse one after the other.

41
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:22,297
And this only in certain
moments and at a precise time.

42
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:25,338
Never sooner and never later.

43
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:28,654
We call them the eight squadrons of death.

44
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:34,336
First, the common fly comes to the
rotting corpse and lays its eggs.

45
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:37,331
This is the beginnig of the cycle.

46
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:40,976
Each group of insects stays for exactly fifteen days.

47
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:43,859
So, you have to multiply fifteen by eight.

48
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:47,209
The number of groups.
This equals four months.

49
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:51,572
Correct. In this case the cycle seems to be complete.

50
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:55,210
Yet, it is already in the second generation.

51
00:09:55,420 --> 00:10:00,619
From this we may conclude that
this head is rotting for eight months.

52
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:04,369
By calculating and determining the number,
the look and the kind of the insects, ...

53
00:10:04,460 --> 00:10:06,815
...you can find out the exact date of death.

54
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:08,214
or of the murder.

55
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:12,293
So our victim was decapitated
some 8 month ago.

56
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:13,939
And 15 days.

57
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:18,290
You must not forget, that the body was on
the bottom of the lake for fifteen days.

58
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:24,416
Before the gases which result from
decomposition brought it to the surface.

59
00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:27,297
Where the first flies were already waiting.

60
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:29,132
Exactly eight and a half months.

61
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:34,494
Perhaps less. It was extraordinary warm then.

62
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:41,214
However, I may assume that the person was
decapitated between the 7th and the 10th.

63
00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:42,895
Is that correct?

64
00:10:44,140 --> 00:10:45,414
Let's think about it.

65
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:50,257
The first girl disappeard on September 9.

66
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:52,655
A sixteen-year-old tourist from Denmark.

67
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:55,971
The body was never found.

68
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:58,370
Same as with the others.

69
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:00,413
It is not nice.

70
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:02,694
Like Greta.

71
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:05,769
Poor Greta.

72
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:11,652
She is also on the list.

73
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:14,734
She is missing but we have
no proof that she is dead.

74
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:17,892
After finding this what's the use
of hiding from the facts.

75
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:23,572
There is a killer.

76
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:28,734
A vicious killer.

77
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:30,333
We'll get him.

78
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:34,377
Someone has to catch this monster.

79
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:37,010
Good night, professor.

80
00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:07,491
Do you know this part of the country?

81
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:09,656
No, this is my first trip to europe.

82
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:14,098
People call it the swiss transylvania.

83
00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:16,980
Why?
- I don't know. They just do.

84
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:20,414
So, you are the Corvino girl!

85
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:23,254
You father is terribly...
- Yes, he is.

86
00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:25,411
I admire him very much.

87
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:27,099
I thought he might have come with you.

88
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:29,734
No, he is workin on the Philippins.

89
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:31,578
He'll be there for almost a year.

90
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:34,260
He can't even be reached by telephone.

91
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:38,017
Well in any case.
He has placed you in good hands.

92
00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:42,737
You know I'm sure you are
going to like our school.

93
00:12:42,980 --> 00:12:45,130
To begin with, we all speak english.

94
00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:48,656
And the our academic program
is based on the american one.

95
00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:50,373
Ah... a bee...

96
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:53,179
Be carefull it may sting you.

97
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:54,815
No!

98
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:02,854
Leave it alone!

99
00:13:04,060 --> 00:13:05,379
Don't kill her.

100
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:13,418
It won't hurt me.
Insects never hurt me. I love them.

101
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:16,058
You... you love them?

102
00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:18,853
Yes, I love all insects.

103
00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:22,457
If you mean...

104
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:42,658
Now Jennifer has arrived.

105
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:45,858
And the first night will come.

106
00:13:46,180 --> 00:13:49,570
A night she'll never forget.

107
00:13:52,420 --> 00:13:53,933
Take her baggage.

108
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:01,414
It is beautiful, isn't it?

109
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:05,934
The estate was once Richard Wagner's.

110
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:08,097
The school is occupied in the main building.

111
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:10,370
The others are closed because they are not safe.

112
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:11,290
Never go in there.

113
00:14:11,420 --> 00:14:13,138
Come on.

114
00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:41,575
I'm starved.
You got anythin to eat?

115
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:42,576
No, sorry.

116
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:46,369
I haven't eaten for two days now.

117
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:48,375
What is that?

118
00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:52,937
Baby food.

119
00:14:56,220 --> 00:15:00,179
My parents left it when they
visited me with my little brother.

120
00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:02,448
He's seven months old.

121
00:15:02,620 --> 00:15:06,295
I bet he is the only male who has
ever seen the inside of this place.

122
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:11,655
Vegetables, how nice. I'm vegetarian.
Do you have a spoon?

123
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:12,457
No.

124
00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:31,809
How is it?

125
00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:35,255
Like cat food.

126
00:15:35,460 --> 00:15:38,611
By the way, I'm Sophie. I'm French.
- Jenniffer.

127
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:41,135
Did you see the director already?

128
00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:43,132
If you talk of the devil...

129
00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:49,579
You are the new girl.
You were expected this afternoon.

130
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:53,813
The flight was delayed.

131
00:15:57,860 --> 00:16:01,375
The school has its rules.
I'm sorry, but I must confiscate this.

132
00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:04,096
Hey wait. You don't know who that is.
That's Paul Corvino.

133
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:08,373
Sophie that is enough. Get into bed!
And if I catch you smoking again, you'll be sorry.

134
00:16:09,220 --> 00:16:10,812
And you young lady... to bed.

135
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:14,608
And switch off the light.

136
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:22,568
That bitch stealing Paul Corvino.

137
00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:26,212
It is all right.
I have a bunch of them in the bag.

138
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:29,969
So tomorrow we put them
all up all over the room.

139
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:33,890
I've seen all his movies
I saw his last one three times.

140
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:38,008
Luck for you. He must have made
me zip through it at least 15 times.

141
00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:39,893
He said he trust in my opinon.

142
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:42,290
You mean you know him?

143
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:44,819
Yes, of course I do.

144
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:46,493
Have you been to bed with him?

145
00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:51,894
Paul Corvino is my father.
- Oh, sorry.

146
00:16:52,020 --> 00:16:52,896
It's all right.

147
00:16:53,540 --> 00:16:55,417
I do know everything about you!
- Do you?

148
00:16:55,660 --> 00:16:58,618
Your mother lived in India and owned a hotel.
She was married again.

149
00:16:58,820 --> 00:16:59,536
Not like your father.

150
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:01,173
You were only 7 when they split up.

151
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:03,130
No, 8.

152
00:17:03,340 --> 00:17:04,819
You were 7!

153
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:07,210
How do you know that?

154
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:09,570
I read Fangoria. - Oh!

155
00:17:11,420 --> 00:17:23,730
It was christmas. I was checking the
presents when the phone rings.

156
00:17:25,660 --> 00:17:29,858
Ma answered.

157
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:39,899
She said she will come soon.

158
00:17:46,780 --> 00:17:48,054
It was her lover.

159
00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:52,332
Then she went...

160
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:57,850
...and did never came back.

161
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:02,934
I always remember it.
Dad got 12 presents.

162
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:07,452
He said he got the 13. From mother to hurt him.

163
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:14,691
You didn't read that in Fangoria?

164
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:16,776
You know I am really glad you are here.

165
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:18,692
I always had to sleep alone.

166
00:18:18,820 --> 00:18:20,890
It can be very scary.

167
00:18:21,060 --> 00:18:22,413
Thank's for coming.

168
00:18:22,580 --> 00:18:24,616
I am the one who should thank you.

169
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:27,214
Don't let me forget that.
I owe you a meal.

170
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:31,851
You know... there is a murder around here!

171
00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:36,929
A maniac who kidnaps girls all ages and kills them.

172
00:18:37,820 --> 00:18:39,651
Could we change the subject?

173
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:42,857
I need my sleep.
I'm really tired from the trip.

174
00:18:43,420 --> 00:18:47,095
You're right.
Sometimes I can't sleep all night thinking about it.

175
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:50,209
What do you think about before you fall asleep?

176
00:18:53,540 --> 00:18:54,609
My father.

177
00:18:56,220 --> 00:18:59,337
If I thought about your father
I'd never get any sleep.

178
00:19:03,340 --> 00:19:06,252
Can I still watch some TV?
I have headphones as well

179
00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:09,688
No problem, good night, Sophie.

180
00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:10,809
Sleep well, Jenniffer.

181
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:54,739
Are you hurt?

182
00:25:22,180 --> 00:25:23,579
What you are doing on the street at night?

183
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:27,615
Can't you answer?

184
00:25:30,220 --> 00:25:31,699
Why are you dressed like that?

185
00:25:32,580 --> 00:25:37,608
Look at her eyes, she used drugs!

186
00:26:00,820 --> 00:26:02,173
Can you see anything?

187
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:05,098
What are we doing now?

188
00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:07,097
Lets run away.

189
00:27:01,140 --> 00:27:02,209
Where are you coming from?

190
00:27:07,420 --> 00:27:09,217
O.k., I'm coming with you.

191
00:27:36,220 --> 00:27:38,415
Is this the first time you've been sleepwalking?

192
00:27:39,420 --> 00:27:42,059
No.

193
00:27:43,420 --> 00:27:48,050
Do you know what happened?

194
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:58,338
I can't remember anything.

195
00:28:03,300 --> 00:28:04,813
My savior.

196
00:28:05,060 --> 00:28:06,698
Are you american?

197
00:28:06,940 --> 00:28:08,453
I am studying at the academy.

198
00:28:08,620 --> 00:28:09,655
Where are you from?

199
00:28:10,220 --> 00:28:14,133
I am from Scotland.
I came here as student and stayed to teach.

200
00:28:14,820 --> 00:28:16,811
Then I had this accident.

201
00:28:17,220 --> 00:28:19,097
I haven't moved since.

202
00:28:19,260 --> 00:28:20,534
What do you teach?

203
00:28:20,780 --> 00:28:24,534
Enthomology.
Study insects.

204
00:28:25,020 --> 00:28:25,770
Really?

205
00:28:26,020 --> 00:28:27,612
Do insects interest you?

206
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:30,494
Yeah. A lot!
I love them.

207
00:28:30,660 --> 00:28:31,410
You mean that?

208
00:28:32,060 --> 00:28:34,290
Absolutely! Why?

209
00:28:34,820 --> 00:28:40,292
You remind me of another girl.
Greta.

210
00:28:40,620 --> 00:28:43,657
Used to come here somtimes and help out.
Mostly secretarial work. And then...

211
00:28:44,020 --> 00:28:44,930
Then?

212
00:28:45,220 --> 00:28:48,098
She was supposed to come here one night.
She never arrived.

213
00:28:49,220 --> 00:28:50,335
The killer got her?

214
00:28:50,620 --> 00:28:51,973
How do you know about that?

215
00:28:55,220 --> 00:28:59,452
I thought so.

216
00:29:01,220 --> 00:29:05,133
You must be frozen, child.
She left a coat here.

217
00:29:05,420 --> 00:29:09,208
It's upstairs.
Here, she'll show you were it is.

218
00:29:44,140 --> 00:29:50,852
You are wonderful, Inge.

219
00:29:51,140 --> 00:29:53,256
Stop it, it hurts.

220
00:29:54,820 --> 00:30:00,099
Hold that.

221
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:02,811
That beats.

222
00:30:05,540 --> 00:30:10,978
They never miss.

223
00:30:11,340 --> 00:30:15,128
This special is supposed to be practically blind.

224
00:30:20,340 --> 00:30:22,410
Be careful, you are in range.

225
00:30:22,820 --> 00:30:23,809
Won't do anythink to me.

226
00:30:28,220 --> 00:30:32,850
In this coat you look like Greta.
She also liked the insects.

227
00:30:33,220 --> 00:30:37,008
But they didn't like her as they like you.

228
00:30:38,820 --> 00:30:39,809
Can you hear the chirping?

229
00:30:40,820 --> 00:30:42,731
This means something special.

230
00:30:44,820 --> 00:30:49,257
It is a mating call.
You are exciting him.

231
00:30:51,420 --> 00:30:52,250
Smell it!

232
00:30:52,420 --> 00:30:54,411
Really?
- Yes, smell.

233
00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:00,219
Sort of sweet.

234
00:31:00,540 --> 00:31:02,610
This substance is secreted by a gland.

235
00:31:03,420 --> 00:31:06,617
It is supposed to attract the female.

236
00:31:08,220 --> 00:31:11,815
You are exciting him and
he is doing his best to excite you.

237
00:31:12,820 --> 00:31:15,459
I don't think so. We only just met.

238
00:31:16,220 --> 00:31:20,054
It isn't the mating season.
I don't understand.

239
00:31:22,820 --> 00:31:24,970
I've never seen anything like that before.

240
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:30,575
Oh, thanks for everything.

241
00:31:36,220 --> 00:31:38,256
Come by any time.

242
00:31:40,620 --> 00:31:41,655
Night.

243
00:31:43,220 --> 00:31:45,017
To make an old man happy...

244
00:31:45,220 --> 00:31:48,337
...take the cablecar.
It is only a five minutes ride from town.

245
00:31:50,220 --> 00:31:51,414
I don't know. Maybe.

246
00:31:52,220 --> 00:31:55,417
And mind how you go. Without sleepwalking.

247
00:31:55,740 --> 00:32:00,530
If it happens to you again, you must say:
I am sleepwalking, I must wake up.

248
00:32:01,340 --> 00:32:04,298
I am sleepwalking, I must wake up.

249
00:32:06,420 --> 00:32:09,298
I am sleepwalking, I must wake up.

250
00:32:12,620 --> 00:32:17,978
I don't need that. I haven't had an attack for years.

251
00:32:19,820 --> 00:32:21,253
The journey was probably to exhausting.

252
00:32:23,060 --> 00:32:24,891
Or it was caused by the change of air.

253
00:32:29,260 --> 00:32:30,613
Maybe the wind.

254
00:32:31,820 --> 00:32:37,656
That is the foehn, a very strange wind.

255
00:32:38,140 --> 00:32:40,176
It is typical for this area here.

256
00:32:40,740 --> 00:32:42,856
It comes from the south over the Alps.

257
00:32:44,020 --> 00:32:46,818
Such a sudden blast of warm air
causes snow avalanches.

258
00:32:48,620 --> 00:32:52,898
Makes the flowers grow,
the larvae of the insects develop faster.

259
00:32:55,020 --> 00:32:56,419
And many complain about headaches.

260
00:32:57,620 --> 00:33:01,090
When it blows, they say
it drives some people to madness.

261
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:04,655
This is a rather strange part of the country here.

262
00:33:06,420 --> 00:33:09,093
This Swiss Transylvania.

263
00:33:16,380 --> 00:33:19,417
Would someone please tell me
what this examination is all about?

264
00:33:19,660 --> 00:33:22,413
What you did last night is highly irregular.

265
00:33:22,540 --> 00:33:25,532
No student ever left the
boarding school at night before.

266
00:33:26,020 --> 00:33:29,410
How many times do I have to tell you that
I did not leave school on purpose.

267
00:33:31,220 --> 00:33:35,179
I walked in my sleep.
This can happen.

268
00:33:36,340 --> 00:33:39,571
But this is not normal.
And it is our duty to find the reason for that.

269
00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:42,095
But don't you understand?
You will find out nothing.

270
00:33:43,220 --> 00:33:47,179
I've been examined by specialists before.
It is not an illness.

271
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:50,572
Not yet, but it could become more serious.

272
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:52,378
And you can't remember anything?

273
00:33:52,620 --> 00:33:55,373
Sleepwalking is far more serious
than talking in the sleep, ...

274
00:33:55,580 --> 00:33:56,808
...or ransacking the fridge.

275
00:33:57,060 --> 00:34:00,416
It could even lead to a new personality trying to emerge.

276
00:34:00,820 --> 00:34:05,575
Sometimes it is the first step on the path to schizophrenia.

277
00:34:06,820 --> 00:34:08,651
So you think I'm crasy?

278
00:34:09,220 --> 00:34:11,211
O.k., forget your EEG.

279
00:34:12,420 --> 00:34:15,969
Calm down, calm down.

280
00:34:16,340 --> 00:34:21,130
O.k., start it.
I will show you who is crazy.

281
00:34:37,620 --> 00:34:38,609
What is going on?

282
00:34:39,140 --> 00:34:40,414
That is strange.

283
00:34:52,020 --> 00:34:59,210
Do you suffer from epilepsy or
do you take something like... drugs?

284
00:35:02,420 --> 00:35:08,416
I am not schizophrenic, epileptic or stoned.

285
00:35:29,620 --> 00:35:31,531
Hello, Shapero Evans?

286
00:35:32,420 --> 00:35:36,493
Hi, I'd like to speak to Moris please?

287
00:35:37,540 --> 00:35:41,499
Jennifer Corvino.
Right, Paul Corvino's daughter.

288
00:35:44,220 --> 00:35:45,619
He is out of town?

289
00:35:48,140 --> 00:35:49,255
Three days?

290
00:35:50,300 --> 00:35:53,019
Holidays?

291
00:35:54,620 --> 00:35:56,815
Which holidays?

292
00:35:57,220 --> 00:35:59,211
Look who is there.

293
00:36:00,420 --> 00:36:01,535
Our zombie.

294
00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:05,095
Have you heard, she walks in her sleep.

295
00:36:05,380 --> 00:36:07,610
Walks in the sleep. If you ask me, she has got a problem.

296
00:36:07,820 --> 00:36:08,775
For me, she is ill.

297
00:36:08,940 --> 00:36:10,532
So thats Paul Corvino's daughter.

298
00:36:10,740 --> 00:36:13,618
That doesn't give her the right
to be such a show-off.

299
00:36:15,220 --> 00:36:17,450
Here she comes.

300
00:36:17,660 --> 00:36:18,888
Lets go.

301
00:36:19,140 --> 00:36:21,096
Yes, I don't want to be close to her.

302
00:36:21,380 --> 00:36:24,053
What's wrong?
- Damn Moris.

303
00:36:24,380 --> 00:36:25,529
Who is he? Your boyfriend?

304
00:36:25,780 --> 00:36:28,135
He's my fathers agent and atourney.

305
00:36:28,380 --> 00:36:30,940
I want him to get me out of this shitty school.

306
00:36:31,300 --> 00:36:33,018
Why do you want to leave?

307
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:36,258
Your little brother isn't the
only male to disgrace this place.

308
00:36:36,460 --> 00:36:38,098
First you forgot the doctor.

309
00:36:38,380 --> 00:36:41,770
He's not a man.
He's got more hands than the entire basketball team.

310
00:36:42,140 --> 00:36:44,495
Second you forgot the killer.
- The killer?

311
00:36:51,020 --> 00:36:54,217
What is the poet trying to say with these words?

312
00:36:54,460 --> 00:36:56,655
Well, who is going to answer?

313
00:36:58,420 --> 00:36:59,409
You, Elisabeth.

314
00:36:59,740 --> 00:37:01,571
Me?
- Yes you.

315
00:37:04,220 --> 00:37:09,897
I think the poet took the words
right out of a Bee Gees song.

316
00:37:11,220 --> 00:37:12,448
That's very funny.

317
00:37:12,660 --> 00:37:14,935
The poet in question is Abraham Kouli.

318
00:37:15,420 --> 00:37:17,058
What if the killer saw me?

319
00:37:19,220 --> 00:37:21,529
I am really scared.
- I would be too.

320
00:37:24,140 --> 00:37:27,576
Can you imagine if I walk in my sleep
again tonight I walk right into him.

321
00:37:31,220 --> 00:37:34,815
Please promise you keep an eye on me tonight.
And lock the door.

322
00:37:35,220 --> 00:37:38,292
And when you hear me get up do anything to wake me.

323
00:37:39,820 --> 00:37:43,654
Promise?
Please say yes.

324
00:37:44,140 --> 00:37:45,971
Sophie? You tell us!

325
00:37:46,220 --> 00:37:47,892
Me?
- Yes, stand up.

326
00:37:52,460 --> 00:37:54,928
The poet with it's eracular style...

327
00:37:55,140 --> 00:37:57,176
The poet with it's ericular style...

328
00:37:57,260 --> 00:37:59,330
Eracular style!
- Ähm... , eracular style.

329
00:37:59,580 --> 00:38:03,209
...tells of the danger we face, should we forget...
...the sense and the meaning of the past...

330
00:38:03,380 --> 00:38:08,090
...tells of the danger we face, should we forget
the sense and the meaning of the past...

331
00:38:08,420 --> 00:38:10,570
And do you believe that danger exists?

332
00:38:10,980 --> 00:38:12,254
Screw the past.

333
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:13,774
Screw the past.

334
00:38:19,420 --> 00:38:21,172
Well done, Sophie.

335
00:38:21,580 --> 00:38:28,179
And what about ancient greece? Shakespear?
Richard Wagner?

336
00:38:28,420 --> 00:38:29,648
And Michael Jackson.

337
00:40:38,700 --> 00:40:40,895
Like it?
- Nice! Were it comes from?

338
00:40:41,260 --> 00:40:44,616
I put in on by mistake.
Guess who it belongs to?

339
00:40:45,500 --> 00:40:48,492
Paul Corvino's daughter.
- The actor?

340
00:40:49,060 --> 00:40:52,655
Her name is Jennifer and she is my roommate.

341
00:40:53,140 --> 00:40:55,779
How is she?

342
00:40:56,220 --> 00:40:58,780
He is fantastic. All those muscles.

343
00:40:59,060 --> 00:41:01,176
Not him! Her?

344
00:41:01,820 --> 00:41:04,857
Oh, she is pretty.
She wears her hair like mine.

345
00:41:05,260 --> 00:41:08,058
You know, I have to watch her at night.
Because she walks in her sleep.

346
00:41:08,260 --> 00:41:09,739
Walks in her sleep?

347
00:41:10,060 --> 00:41:13,496
Yeah!
She gets up and she walks, like this.

348
00:41:18,500 --> 00:41:19,774
Come back.

349
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:32,413
I have to go.

350
00:41:32,620 --> 00:41:34,850
It takes long to come home.

351
00:41:35,020 --> 00:41:36,897
Oh, come on, stay a while longer.

352
00:41:37,100 --> 00:41:39,170
I really have to go now.

353
00:41:40,420 --> 00:41:42,729
You shit.
- What did you say?

354
00:41:43,140 --> 00:41:44,653
I said: Fuck you!

355
00:43:10,620 --> 00:43:20,939
Sleepwalking... I must... I must wake up.

356
00:47:31,740 --> 00:47:36,018
The police came this morning. My pale the head-mistress
told them not to believe anything I say, ...

357
00:47:36,180 --> 00:47:38,136
...because she thinks I'm crazy.

358
00:47:40,340 --> 00:47:40,977
Maybe you think I'm crazy too, dad.

359
00:47:41,140 --> 00:47:47,978
I mean there was really nothing I could do.

360
00:47:48,180 --> 00:47:50,740
I was so scared that I couldn't say anything
about what I saw or why I screamed.

361
00:48:20,980 --> 00:48:23,699
Do you think the glove belongs to the killer?

362
00:48:24,220 --> 00:48:28,008
Yeah! I'm sure of it!
- But why are there maggots?

363
00:48:29,620 --> 00:48:35,490
It is the larvae.
I am going to examine it.

364
00:48:37,700 --> 00:48:39,497
We know more after that if we are lucky.

365
00:48:41,140 --> 00:48:44,291
Maybe I can answer your questions also.

366
00:48:44,580 --> 00:48:48,858
You're the professor; I trust you.
You should examine me, too.

367
00:48:50,420 --> 00:48:51,899
Jenniffer.
- Yes?

368
00:48:53,140 --> 00:48:55,210
Don't forget your book.

369
00:48:58,420 --> 00:49:00,411
Have you any idea, why they behave like that?

370
00:49:01,820 --> 00:49:02,935
They have never done this before.

371
00:49:04,420 --> 00:49:08,732
I guess they sense the mood I'm in.

372
00:49:09,540 --> 00:49:14,216
I'm often in a bad mood.
Upset about something.

373
00:49:14,380 --> 00:49:16,450
But they don't carry on like this.

374
00:49:18,820 --> 00:49:22,779
In ancient Greece the butterfly symbolized the soul.

375
00:49:22,980 --> 00:49:24,493
The so-called psyche.

376
00:49:26,660 --> 00:49:30,175
That's why we speak of a butterfly-psyche.

377
00:49:30,420 --> 00:49:34,174
Is there an association between
the insects and the human soul?

378
00:49:36,820 --> 00:49:41,291
I think the key to this mystery
can only be found in the supernatural.

379
00:49:41,460 --> 00:49:45,135
And if you are a very sensitive
person you feel something of that.

380
00:49:46,020 --> 00:49:46,930
Right?

381
00:49:49,380 --> 00:49:50,529
Yes.

382
00:49:51,460 --> 00:49:56,409
How about the glove.

383
00:49:58,220 --> 00:50:02,054
A insect, a firefly showed me the way.

384
00:50:07,220 --> 00:50:08,414
The police was there.

385
00:50:10,820 --> 00:50:12,731
They asked me lots of questions.

386
00:50:13,740 --> 00:50:15,617
But I didn't tell them about the glove.

387
00:50:18,220 --> 00:50:20,450
I don't want them to think I'm crazy.

388
00:50:23,420 --> 00:50:26,139
You can tell me, I'm not the police.

389
00:50:27,140 --> 00:50:28,289
What happened?

390
00:50:33,740 --> 00:50:38,689
I was alone in the dark.

391
00:50:43,420 --> 00:50:45,172
And I was afraid.

392
00:50:45,700 --> 00:50:50,410
A firefly came.

393
00:50:50,820 --> 00:50:52,697
It was like it heard me.

394
00:50:52,940 --> 00:50:55,215
And it answerd my call.

395
00:51:01,220 --> 00:51:04,496
You calmed them down, just by telling that.

396
00:51:05,820 --> 00:51:08,778
That's ridiculous.
- No.

397
00:51:09,540 --> 00:51:12,134
That's the greatest discovery I've made.

398
00:51:13,020 --> 00:51:15,898
Through you my expectations were confirmed.

399
00:51:16,740 --> 00:51:19,698
Now I have the facts my
colleages considered absurd.

400
00:51:20,220 --> 00:51:25,135
The paranormal powers that
are unusual in human beeings...

401
00:51:26,420 --> 00:51:30,459
...are perfectly natural in insects.

402
00:51:31,100 --> 00:51:39,769
Some species communicate with each other
over far distances like telepathy.

403
00:51:41,420 --> 00:51:43,695
I could give you many samples.

404
00:51:43,900 --> 00:51:45,856
I wrote a book about it.

405
00:51:46,020 --> 00:51:47,009
You should read it.

406
00:51:47,220 --> 00:51:51,577
It's perfectly normal for insects
to be slightly telepathic.

407
00:51:52,420 --> 00:51:54,490
It's normal for insects.

408
00:51:59,220 --> 00:52:00,653
But am I normal?

409
00:52:15,140 --> 00:52:16,016
Jennifer!

410
00:52:31,020 --> 00:52:32,248
Why me?

411
00:52:32,460 --> 00:52:34,690
Fräulein Corvino can not be left alone.

412
00:52:35,180 --> 00:52:37,011
I want someone in here with her.

413
00:52:37,220 --> 00:52:39,893
I want to know everything she says and does.

414
00:52:40,140 --> 00:52:43,212
I'm scared of her.
She arrived and Sophie disappeared.

415
00:52:43,420 --> 00:52:45,650
Plus she's crazy.
Listen to this:

416
00:52:49,060 --> 00:52:52,735
Dear dad...
Ah, here it is.

417
00:52:53,220 --> 00:52:56,018
Do you remember what the doctor said about...

418
00:52:56,180 --> 00:52:58,740
...sleepwalking manifested
with split personality?

419
00:52:58,980 --> 00:53:02,336
It's true.
My second personality is there.

420
00:53:02,580 --> 00:53:05,333
Do you know how?
I communicate with insects.

421
00:53:08,140 --> 00:53:12,531
I mean I have discovered,
I have power over them.

422
00:53:12,700 --> 00:53:16,295
I'm not kidding.
I even have a witness.

423
00:53:16,500 --> 00:53:20,254
The famous enthemologist
John Mc Gregor who lives near here.

424
00:53:20,460 --> 00:53:21,449
We've become friends.

425
00:53:21,580 --> 00:53:22,615
See, she is crazy.

426
00:53:24,300 --> 00:53:25,858
This-is mine!

427
00:53:34,980 --> 00:53:37,289
Hey Jennifer listen!
- What?

428
00:53:39,340 --> 00:53:41,854
I'm a spider!
Look I'm a spider

429
00:53:44,220 --> 00:53:46,097
Stop it.

430
00:53:52,380 --> 00:53:53,369
I'm a killer-snake.

431
00:53:53,660 --> 00:53:54,649
I'm a fly.

432
00:53:54,940 --> 00:53:56,851
No!
Stop it!

433
00:54:07,820 --> 00:54:12,894
We worship you...
We worship you...

434
00:54:43,420 --> 00:54:44,489
I love you.

435
00:54:47,140 --> 00:54:48,368
I love you all.

436
00:54:52,900 --> 00:54:54,333
I love all of you.

437
00:56:01,787 --> 00:56:02,776
She's still asleep.

438
00:56:02,907 --> 00:56:05,182
I called an ambulance to have
her taken to the mental hospital.

439
00:56:05,347 --> 00:56:07,258
They'll be her any minute.

440
00:56:07,427 --> 00:56:10,499
At least they'll be better
equipt to keep her calm.

441
00:56:10,787 --> 00:56:12,982
Is she insane?

442
00:56:13,387 --> 00:56:15,105
Well, she is not normal.

443
00:56:15,427 --> 00:56:17,019
She is diabolic.

444
00:56:17,227 --> 00:56:18,785
Diabolic?
- Yes!

445
00:56:19,387 --> 00:56:23,539
Yes, the bible also refers
to the devil as Belzebub.

446
00:56:23,867 --> 00:56:25,539
Which means: Lord of the Flies.

447
00:56:26,987 --> 00:56:30,297
She is the Lord of the flies.

448
00:56:32,387 --> 00:56:34,025
Call me as soon as she wakes up.

449
00:59:10,107 --> 00:59:11,506
Diabolic?

450
00:59:14,307 --> 00:59:17,663
Does Jennifer look like the devil to you?

451
00:59:21,587 --> 00:59:24,101
No, you are not the devil.

452
00:59:25,187 --> 00:59:26,905
The only devil here is the killer.

453
00:59:27,987 --> 00:59:30,455
But I understand how you must be feeling.

454
00:59:32,307 --> 00:59:33,945
I know what it feels like to be different.

455
00:59:35,307 --> 00:59:41,701
And the conditions that go with it:
pityer, ironing, revotion, annoyance.

456
00:59:42,387 --> 00:59:45,902
People have the ability to almost hate yourself!

457
00:59:47,067 --> 00:59:49,661
There's a big difference between you and me.

458
00:59:50,307 --> 00:59:52,298
When that car bashed into me, I lost something.

459
00:59:52,507 --> 00:59:54,304
You gained something.

460
00:59:54,587 --> 00:59:59,456
You are in a position to do extraordinary things.

461
00:59:59,987 --> 01:00:03,662
With that gift of you...
Come on, I want to show you something.

462
01:00:03,827 --> 01:00:04,816
It is very interessant.

463
01:00:11,907 --> 01:00:12,896
Look.

464
01:00:16,307 --> 01:00:17,820
These were inside the glove.

465
01:00:19,307 --> 01:00:21,423
The larvae of the great sarcophacus.

466
01:00:22,187 --> 01:00:24,178
What a menacing name.

467
01:00:24,347 --> 01:00:26,303
Apropriate to the insect that bears it.

468
01:00:31,387 --> 01:00:36,142
It lives exclusivly of dead bodys.

469
01:00:38,387 --> 01:00:39,979
The great sarcophacus?

470
01:00:42,067 --> 01:00:49,985
A strange name.

471
01:00:50,587 --> 01:00:53,260
It is capeable of picking up the scent
of a dead body over fast distances.

472
01:00:54,987 --> 01:01:00,903
It's sensory reception is extraordinary, quite unique.

473
01:01:01,587 --> 01:01:03,896
But why do the gloves have so many lavae?

474
01:01:04,107 --> 01:01:06,496
Perhaps because when
the murderer hides his victims...

475
01:01:06,627 --> 01:01:09,095
...he likes to keep in physical contact with them.

476
01:01:09,267 --> 01:01:13,101
Conserving them.

477
01:01:15,387 --> 01:01:16,786
He is a psycho.

478
01:01:17,587 --> 01:01:24,345
If we need to get him, we have to call on the
services of 2 of the greatest detectives ever known.

479
01:01:25,947 --> 01:01:28,222
Perhaps I should say unknown. - Up to now.

480
01:01:28,987 --> 01:01:30,420
But this will change.

481
01:01:31,667 --> 01:01:32,656
Who were they?

482
01:01:34,067 --> 01:01:43,578
You and him: the great sarcophocus.

483
01:01:46,787 --> 01:01:48,015
Spread your hand.

484
01:01:57,587 --> 01:02:01,580
See, he's not afraid of you.
He won't do that for me.

485
01:02:02,387 --> 01:02:04,821
Ask him to lead you where
the dead bodies are hidden.

486
01:02:05,587 --> 01:02:07,066
He'll lead you.

487
01:02:08,387 --> 01:02:10,617
That fly is your magic wand.

488
01:02:11,987 --> 01:02:13,056
You mean that is working?

489
01:02:14,907 --> 01:02:16,943
Of course!

490
01:02:17,587 --> 01:02:21,102
It will take time.
It could be anywhere.

491
01:02:22,387 --> 01:02:26,665
Not anywhere. On a 52 kilometer route.

492
01:02:27,987 --> 01:02:30,581
The first girl to dissapear was a danish tourist.

493
01:02:30,987 --> 01:02:33,979
She took a bus of the red line.

494
01:02:34,187 --> 01:02:37,816
It starts on the city square on a 52 kilometer route.

495
01:02:37,947 --> 01:02:40,415
Stops at various tourist traps on the way.

496
01:02:40,987 --> 01:02:42,659
She was seen getting on that bus.

497
01:02:44,387 --> 01:02:48,665
When you get near to the killers house,
you'll know about it soon enough.

498
01:02:48,787 --> 01:02:50,778
Because the sarcopocus will go crazy.

499
01:02:51,187 --> 01:02:55,544
And head straight for the dead body.

500
01:02:55,907 --> 01:02:59,263
All you have to do is follow
him and come straight back.

501
01:03:00,387 --> 01:03:01,422
Do you feel up to it?

502
01:03:03,387 --> 01:03:11,579
Yeah!

503
01:03:15,907 --> 01:03:18,944
I want him caught... for Sophia.

504
01:03:19,707 --> 01:03:20,856
And Greta.

505
01:03:21,227 --> 01:03:25,937
I wish you all the luck in the world,
my two detectives.

506
01:04:54,227 --> 01:04:58,698
Excuse me!

507
01:04:59,067 --> 01:05:00,386
What do you want?

508
01:05:00,987 --> 01:05:03,137
Can you please close the window?

509
01:05:03,267 --> 01:05:04,222
No!

510
01:05:04,747 --> 01:05:06,817
You naughty girl.

511
01:05:50,587 --> 01:05:52,145
Wait, Wait, Wait.

512
01:05:53,947 --> 01:05:55,699
Thanks.

513
01:10:39,867 --> 01:10:40,697
What are you doing here?

514
01:10:42,467 --> 01:10:44,344
Ahm... I was following the...

515
01:10:44,467 --> 01:10:45,616
You came here to steal, did you?

516
01:10:47,987 --> 01:10:49,340
No, I was looking for someone.

517
01:10:49,507 --> 01:10:55,104
The house is empty. No one's left here.

518
01:10:55,227 --> 01:10:58,344
The former attendance moved out 8 month ago.
The house is for sale.

519
01:10:58,547 --> 01:11:02,301
I'm sorry, I'm really sorry.

520
01:12:05,827 --> 01:12:08,022
May I help you?
- Who are you??

521
01:12:08,267 --> 01:12:12,340
I am the estate agent.
If you are looking for a house, I am your man.

522
01:12:12,507 --> 01:12:16,022
Anyone living in the house now?

523
01:12:16,307 --> 01:12:20,698
No. By the way, where did you come from?
I didn't hear you drive up.

524
01:12:20,987 --> 01:12:25,219
How long has the house been empty?

525
01:12:25,587 --> 01:12:29,865
I don't know. 7 to 8 month maybe.
Who was living here before?

526
01:12:30,227 --> 01:12:33,742
We do not give out that kind of information.

527
01:12:33,987 --> 01:12:36,979
It's absolutely confidential
and against our company...

528
01:12:37,147 --> 01:12:40,662
I'm Inspector Geiger, Kantonpolizei.

529
01:14:29,947 --> 01:14:34,145
You locked yourself out.

530
01:14:35,987 --> 01:14:37,181
This damn machine.

531
01:14:40,987 --> 01:14:42,784
I wonder what is going on around here?

532
01:14:45,387 --> 01:14:48,857
Is there someone there?

533
01:14:50,307 --> 01:14:56,826
Who... Who is it?

534
01:14:57,307 --> 01:15:01,266
Hey, answer me. Who are you?

535
01:16:36,307 --> 01:16:38,537
Most of our patients are kept under restraint.

536
01:16:39,707 --> 01:16:43,541
Take my word for it inspector:
The person you are looking for, is not one of ours.

537
01:16:43,747 --> 01:16:45,339
No one's ever escaped from here.

538
01:16:46,467 --> 01:16:47,422
Correct.

539
01:16:48,587 --> 01:16:52,023
But I'm working from the
exact opposite assumption.

540
01:16:52,707 --> 01:16:54,459
I gonna explain?

541
01:16:56,707 --> 01:17:04,341
It isn't if someone got out
of your institution but rather got in.

542
01:17:04,707 --> 01:17:06,902
You have had such a case I believe?

543
01:17:07,067 --> 01:17:08,785
Yes, a curious incident.

544
01:17:09,267 --> 01:17:11,098
It happened about 15 years ago.

545
01:17:11,387 --> 01:17:15,426
Here on our basement level. Since then it has
only been accessible from members of our staff.

546
01:17:16,107 --> 01:17:20,862
The more down one goes in this place
the more monsterous the inmates become.

547
01:17:21,067 --> 01:17:22,705
Probably the same in hell.

548
01:17:22,907 --> 01:17:25,705
Until you reach the last circle.
The one without a center.

549
01:17:42,347 --> 01:17:43,496
Shit Moris. I'm telling you.

550
01:17:43,667 --> 01:17:45,623
I won't stay a minute longer.

551
01:17:45,987 --> 01:17:49,024
I wanna come home and I
don't have the money for a ticket.

552
01:17:52,587 --> 01:17:54,384
I run away.

553
01:17:55,227 --> 01:17:57,297
The want to keep me in the clinic.

554
01:17:58,547 --> 01:17:59,616
What?

555
01:18:03,587 --> 01:18:05,020
It is a long story.

556
01:18:05,227 --> 01:18:07,787
Take me back and I tell you.

557
01:18:08,587 --> 01:18:10,225
Where can you transfer the money?

558
01:18:11,187 --> 01:18:12,666
SKA, how is the address?

559
01:18:14,187 --> 01:18:16,940
Send me some money.

560
01:18:17,907 --> 01:18:21,456
Do it Moris, I don't want to be murdered.

561
01:18:23,707 --> 01:18:25,584
Yes, I said murdered.

562
01:18:26,387 --> 01:18:29,345
Someone tried it already.

563
01:19:16,067 --> 01:19:19,104
I am sorry,
there is nothing here in your name.

564
01:19:20,107 --> 01:19:22,701
Are you sure?
- I'm afraid yes.

565
01:19:24,987 --> 01:19:28,218
Maybe it has just arrived and
is not in the computer yet?

566
01:19:28,347 --> 01:19:29,336
I will check.

567
01:19:36,227 --> 01:19:38,582
No, sorry.

568
01:19:38,747 --> 01:19:41,944
Now what am I supposed to do?
It is an emergency.

569
01:19:42,227 --> 01:19:45,424
It could arrive at any time.
Look, why don't you come back later.

570
01:19:45,667 --> 01:19:50,343
Can I wait here?

571
01:19:50,547 --> 01:19:51,866
Sure you can wait over there.

572
01:19:52,067 --> 01:19:54,456
But I suggest you go for a walk.

573
01:19:56,507 --> 01:19:57,622
I wait.

574
01:20:36,507 --> 01:20:37,656
Hello Jenifer.

575
01:20:38,067 --> 01:20:42,106
Your fathers atorney,
Mr. Shapiro called us from New York.

576
01:20:44,587 --> 01:20:51,140
He was very worried about you and extremely
angry with us for, lets say, loosing you.

577
01:20:51,227 --> 01:20:52,421
What a bastard.

578
01:20:52,707 --> 01:20:54,902
He sounded very resonably on the phone.

579
01:20:55,067 --> 01:20:59,299
He spoke to me and only calmed down when
I told him I would come for you myself.

580
01:20:59,587 --> 01:21:01,145
He said I would find you here.

581
01:21:02,107 --> 01:21:04,780
I'm not going back to that school.
- Of course not.

582
01:21:05,387 --> 01:21:07,947
He said you want to go back
to America immidiately?

583
01:21:08,307 --> 01:21:09,456
Is that true?
- Yes.

584
01:21:09,747 --> 01:21:12,466
Well, he authorised me to buy you a ticket
and to give you some money.

585
01:21:12,667 --> 01:21:13,656
Is that all right?

586
01:21:16,347 --> 01:21:18,338
Ok.
- Good.

587
01:21:27,387 --> 01:21:28,661
Good Luck.

588
01:21:30,387 --> 01:21:31,581
What time is my flight?

589
01:21:31,987 --> 01:21:34,979
Twelve noon, tomorrow.
The last flight of the day has already left.

590
01:21:35,507 --> 01:21:39,420
And what about tonight?
- I'm not gonna sleep in the school.

591
01:21:40,387 --> 01:21:43,140
I'm not going back there, I'm not gonna sleep there,
I never wanna to see this place again.

592
01:21:43,307 --> 01:21:45,821
Don't worry, if that's what you want, it's all right.

593
01:21:46,107 --> 01:21:48,701
Mr. Shapiro said to do whatever you want.

594
01:21:54,787 --> 01:21:56,505
You can stay with me tonight.

595
01:21:58,587 --> 01:22:01,420
It's enormous.
Do you live here alone?

596
01:22:01,587 --> 01:22:02,383
No.

597
01:22:20,787 --> 01:22:24,177
You sleep in here Jennifer.
I hope you find it comfortable enough.

598
01:22:24,627 --> 01:22:26,538
I hope you like it here.

599
01:22:29,987 --> 01:22:31,659
Looks fine, thank you.

600
01:22:33,307 --> 01:22:35,457
Why are the mirrors covered like that.

601
01:22:36,067 --> 01:22:37,978
I told you I don't live alone.

602
01:22:38,147 --> 01:22:40,502
I have a small son.
He is very sick.

603
01:22:41,587 --> 01:22:44,818
I covered the mirrors for his sake.
He doesn't want to see his reflection.

604
01:22:46,987 --> 01:22:50,423
I worry about him very much.
He's changed my life completely.

605
01:22:50,627 --> 01:22:53,585
Sometimes I think he's driving me crazy.

606
01:22:54,987 --> 01:22:56,136
I'm sorry.

607
01:22:56,467 --> 01:22:59,698
These are things that can happen in a womans life.

608
01:23:00,387 --> 01:23:02,582
But don't worry.
You won't see him.

609
01:23:02,987 --> 01:23:04,500
Oh, I don't mind if...

610
01:23:04,987 --> 01:23:06,739
It's better if you don't.

611
01:23:07,747 --> 01:23:10,102
He stays in his room with his crazy thoughts.

612
01:23:11,667 --> 01:23:13,862
Would you like something?
A cup of tea?

613
01:23:14,347 --> 01:23:15,905
No, I don't wanna bother you.

614
01:23:16,067 --> 01:23:17,261
It's no bother.

615
01:24:05,987 --> 01:24:08,820
I am sorry, I kicked the train by mistake.

616
01:24:08,987 --> 01:24:11,581
I've hit him.
Maybe he's hurt?

617
01:24:11,987 --> 01:24:13,261
Hurt?

618
01:24:17,787 --> 01:24:20,255
Don't grab him like that.
- Why not?

619
01:24:20,587 --> 01:24:23,340
What on earth are you thinking?

620
01:24:24,387 --> 01:24:29,097
It's only a doll.
You are a very sensitive young lady.

621
01:24:30,387 --> 01:24:32,503
Are you frightened?
- No.

622
01:24:32,907 --> 01:24:36,820
Yes, you are.
I can see it in your eyes.

623
01:24:39,387 --> 01:24:42,026
You are burning up.
You have a fever?

624
01:24:42,427 --> 01:24:44,463
No, I don't.
- Yes, you do.

625
01:24:44,787 --> 01:24:48,097
In this part of the country, with this wind,
it's hardly surprising.

626
01:24:48,467 --> 01:24:51,140
I'll get you a pill.

627
01:24:51,907 --> 01:24:53,863
You don't want to leave
with a cold tomorrow, do you?

628
01:24:55,907 --> 01:24:57,738
Imagine what Mr. Shapiro would say.

629
01:25:14,067 --> 01:25:17,059
You should take them both,
but if you prefere, one is enough.

630
01:25:18,067 --> 01:25:19,785
I don't want any pills.

631
01:25:21,507 --> 01:25:24,101
Where is the bathroom?
- The bathroom is over there.

632
01:25:24,747 --> 01:25:26,100
And you will take the pills!

633
01:25:26,387 --> 01:25:28,537
I never take any pills.

634
01:25:29,347 --> 01:25:31,622
Do what you are told.
You are my responsibility.

635
01:25:31,947 --> 01:25:33,824
I'm not ill.

636
01:25:36,427 --> 01:25:39,703
What kind of tabletts are this?

637
01:25:39,987 --> 01:25:45,345
Against fever, now take it.

638
01:25:45,667 --> 01:25:49,785
You are hurting me.
- Take the pills!

639
01:25:52,547 --> 01:25:55,186
All right I'll take the pills.

640
01:25:55,987 --> 01:25:57,818
I'll get you some water.
- I can get it myself.

641
01:25:59,947 --> 01:26:01,141
Shit. Get out of the way.

642
01:26:04,307 --> 01:26:05,581
May I close the door?

643
01:26:13,307 --> 01:26:14,660
What a bitch.

644
01:27:35,987 --> 01:27:39,536
The larvae of the great sarcophcus
exclusively live of bodies.

645
01:27:39,747 --> 01:27:42,056
Even of human bodies.

646
01:28:29,067 --> 01:28:31,740
Jennifer, what are you doing.

647
01:28:31,987 --> 01:28:36,265
Jennifer, answer me!
Open the door!

648
01:28:36,587 --> 01:28:40,978
Answer me!
How dare you act like this.

649
01:28:41,387 --> 01:28:44,743
Let me in!

650
01:28:45,547 --> 01:28:52,737
Open the door!

651
01:29:32,347 --> 01:29:34,907
Why didn't you open the door?
What were you doing?

652
01:29:35,227 --> 01:29:37,661
Did you take the pills?
What were you doing?

653
01:29:57,987 --> 01:30:03,015
Who do you call?
- Morris, just to tell him I'm o.k.

654
01:30:03,147 --> 01:30:05,945
Tomorrow.
- Now.

655
01:30:06,107 --> 01:30:08,462
Just a short call.
- No!

656
01:30:09,307 --> 01:30:10,979
Let me go.

657
01:30:24,707 --> 01:30:27,540
I said no, do you understand?

658
01:30:27,747 --> 01:30:31,183
You are in my house
and you are doing what I say.

659
01:31:42,027 --> 01:31:45,099
What I wanted to ask.

660
01:31:45,347 --> 01:31:51,786
15 years ago, when you were still
working in Basel, you were assaulted?

661
01:31:52,587 --> 01:31:55,226
Surely you haven't forgotten the incident.

662
01:31:56,387 --> 01:31:58,901
No.
Look at this.

663
01:32:01,587 --> 01:32:05,500
He pulled me to him to the bars.

664
01:32:05,827 --> 01:32:08,341
I understand Frau Bruckner forgive me.

665
01:32:09,187 --> 01:32:12,543
But we have to be precise.

666
01:32:12,987 --> 01:32:16,821
So you moved here 8 months ago.
Is that correct?

667
01:32:16,947 --> 01:32:19,939
Yes that is so, Inspector.
Please come this way.

668
01:32:21,907 --> 01:32:23,135
And where were you living before that?

669
01:32:23,907 --> 01:32:25,545
Outside Zürich.

670
01:32:57,987 --> 01:33:00,581
Perhaps the murderer hides his victims.

671
01:33:00,707 --> 01:33:02,982
He likes to keep in
physical contact with them.

672
01:33:03,107 --> 01:33:06,338
He's a psychopath.

673
01:35:57,387 --> 01:35:58,536
Mr. Schapiero?
- Yes.

674
01:35:58,747 --> 01:36:00,977
Your car rental agency.
Your car is right outside.

675
01:36:01,147 --> 01:36:02,987
Here is the key.
Do you need a map, sir?

676
01:36:02,987 --> 01:36:04,898
No, thank you, I know the area.

677
01:37:47,227 --> 01:37:51,778
Don't be afraid. I'm Inspector Geiger.
I want to help you.

678
01:37:51,987 --> 01:37:53,579
Stop shouting.

679
01:40:29,107 --> 01:40:33,544
Go away. You scare me.
- I won't hurt you.

680
01:40:33,867 --> 01:40:37,576
I don't want you here.
- I know your mother was bad.

681
01:40:38,987 --> 01:40:43,265
I wanna help.
- You can't help.

682
01:40:47,387 --> 01:40:49,582
You don't have to worry
about the mirrors anymore.

683
01:40:57,147 --> 01:40:58,978
It's all over.

684
01:46:55,707 --> 01:46:57,584
Morris!
- Jenniffer!

685
01:47:10,067 --> 01:47:15,425
He was desceived but he was my son.

686
01:47:15,987 --> 01:47:20,265
And you killed him.
Why didn't I kill you before?

687
01:47:20,987 --> 01:47:27,506
I killed the Inspector and your Professor friend.

688
01:47:27,667 --> 01:47:30,261
And now I may kill you to avenge him.

689
01:47:30,547 --> 01:47:35,063
Why don't you call your insects
Go on! Call them! Call them.
