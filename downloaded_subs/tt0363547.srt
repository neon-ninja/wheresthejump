Where's he...

347
00:32:46,465 --> 00:32:48,833
No, no. I mean,
they saw us.

348
00:32:48,834 --> 00:32:51,936
So, I mean, they're gonna
be coming back, baby.
Don't worry.

349
00:32:51,937 --> 00:32:54,872
I mean, they're gonna
send somebody or something.

350

ANA: It's safe here.
We'll just wait for them
to come back.

351
00:33:17,162 --> 00:33:20,655
I don't want anybody
sneaking around
and stealing shit.

352
00:33:23,201 --> 00:33:24,567

353
00:33:27,906 --> 00:33:29,374
Sweet dreams.

354

Those assholes
are gonna get us killed.

355

to create problems
for Luda and me.

357

The helicopter's
coming back soon.

358
00:33:48,026 --> 00:33:49,357
I hope so.

359
00:33:50,629 --> 00:33:52,363
And what's that
supposed to mean?

360
00:33:52,364 --> 00:33:55,533
It means it might come
and it might not.
We don't know.

361
00:33:55,534 --> 00:33:57,501
What do you mean
it not come back?

362

You said it was
coming back!

363

Hey, baby, listen, listen.

he doesn't know shit.

I hear you talking a lot.

saying something.

that we should listen, huh?

Hey, Officer,
how you like following
a guy that sells TVs?

374
00:34:40,045 --> 00:34:43,504
About as much
as I like following a guy
who steals them.

375
00:34:45,617 --> 00:34:47,518
I'm not following anyone.

376
00:34:47,519 --> 00:34:50,420

to get my brother.

to feed on warm flesh.

if any, reasoning power.

are so full of shit.

the same damn thing
all day.

they kill gets up.

something that sucks?

at Dairy Queen?

I don't know when
we'll be back on the air.

Yeah.

390
00:35:29,661 --> 00:35:31,729
She was coming
over tonight.

391
00:35:31,730 --> 00:35:34,028
I would have tapped
that shit for sure.

everybody's dead, okay?

to report the news to you
in these past 26 years.

That sucks too.

399

Hell is overflowing.

400
00:35:56,221 --> 00:35:59,714
And Satan is sending
his dead to us.

401
00:36:02,060 --> 00:36:04,791
Why? Because

402
00:36:06,431 --> 00:36:08,559
you have sex out of wedlock.

403
00:36:11,303 --> 00:36:13,601

your god will judge you?

407

Well, friends,

408
00:36:31,222 --> 00:36:32,622
now we know.

409
00:36:37,228 --> 00:36:40,096
When there is
no more room in hell,

410
00:36:43,034 --> 00:36:46,436
the dead will walk the earth

411
00:37:17,035 --> 00:37:18,730

I wish somebody was working
at Hallowed Grounds.

How hard is it
to make a cup of coffee?

420

mocha latte with foam.

What's the news?

424
00:38:12,724 --> 00:38:13,924

I'm telling you.

of shit, right?

Yeah, I do all that
kind of shit.

Is this the end of times?

I'm telling you,
I'm fucked.

bad things in my life, man.

you've done.

No, he plays the organ.
