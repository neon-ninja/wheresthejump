1
00:00:26,110 --> 00:00:28,420
An ordinary university student, Kurono Kei...

2
00:00:29,090 --> 00:00:32,800
...and Katou Masaru, who is working
to support his younger brother.

3
00:00:33,860 --> 00:00:36,800
The two people who were childhood friends
coincidentally encountered each other again.

4
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:39,110
And then...

5
00:00:39,590 --> 00:00:40,430
...they died.

6
00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:45,390
The two who were supposed to be dead
woke up in an apartment...

7
00:00:45,770 --> 00:00:50,540
...in which a black mysterious sphere
called GANTZ is placed.

8
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:53,650
In that room which they can't get out of,

9
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:57,420
they received a command from GANTZ.

10
00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:59,160
"If you want to go back, go crush this guy."

11
00:00:59,390 --> 00:01:02,400
That was... to battle with the aliens
who would invade the Earth...

12
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:05,830
An inescapable command.

13
00:01:09,650 --> 00:01:12,270
They were then sent to a parallel world...

14
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:15,060
...and without knowing what was going on,
they battled with the aliens.

15
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:17,500
They barely got their victory.

16
00:01:21,770 --> 00:01:24,150
What awaited Kurono and the others
when they returned to the room was...

17
00:01:24,610 --> 00:01:26,510
...were the remarks that GANTZ gave them
for battling.

18
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:29,540
and the total points they got
for defeating the aliens.

19
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:30,810
If they get 100 points,

20
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:32,950
they can be released from this world,

21
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:36,320
or revive a beloved person of theirs.

22
00:01:36,510 --> 00:01:38,110
It was a frightening reality.

23
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:42,160
They have their life all thrown out of order...

24
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:44,500
...while being able to return to normal life
when day comes.

25
00:01:44,830 --> 00:01:46,170
People who were supposed to die...

26
00:01:47,530 --> 00:01:49,910
Kurono, who came to terms with reality
while battling...

27
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:52,520
...and Katou,
who continued to deny this battle.

28
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:56,670
The tough and painful battle goes on anyway.

29
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:59,200
...and their friends died one by one.

30
00:01:59,830 --> 00:02:00,790
And, in the end,

31
00:02:01,130 --> 00:02:05,500
while facing the huge Goddess of Mercy,
even Katou's life was taken away.

32
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:09,000
When Kurono was about to give in to sadness,

33
00:02:09,410 --> 00:02:11,520
Kojima Tae helped him stand on his feet
again with her honest feelings.

34
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:15,670
He swore in his heart that he would earn
100 points in order to revive Katou.

35
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:18,030
In a battle that sees no end,

36
00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:21,490

Soon it will be five months since the day
the National Museum was collapsed,

67
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:11,880
and yet the cause of the incident
still remains unknown.

68
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:15,520
According to the police, there's a possibility
that it's an act of terrorism.

so will you give me some of your time?

132
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:28,260
Since you abruptly announced your break from activities,
there have been many speculations going around, haven't there?

133
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:32,860

your illness, marriage, pregnancy, or your move to overseas.

134

136
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:50,170

sequence of events that've been happening.

155
00:20:57,620 --> 00:20:59,260

we can go where we want.

156
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:02,860

the black sphere?

157
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:05,420

158
00:21:05,860 --> 00:21:06,580
Where did you hear about it?

159
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:08,780
I came here today to ask about that.

160
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:11,500
Where is that room?

161
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:16,240
It's not in this reality.

162
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:19,780
What do you mean?

163
00:21:20,860 --> 00:21:22,740
You can't to go to that room
if it's not necessary.

164
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:42,290

165
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:45,000
That's the fifth question.

166
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:46,640

after the same incident as I do?

168
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:48,580

00:22:21,660 --> 00:22:24,620
Until your brother comes back, Kurono-kun...

178
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:27,340
Seems that
he can't think of any other thing.

179
00:22:31,540 --> 00:22:32,120
But I'm fine.

180
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:36,380
When things calm down,
I'll try asking him once.

181
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:37,480
Seriously?

182
00:22:38,250 --> 00:22:39,590
Seriously.

183
00:22:39,990 --> 00:22:42,040
Ok! Homework.

184
00:22:51,940 --> 00:22:56,120
[Total 94 points. 6 points until it's over]

185
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:56,120
It's gonna be soon, huh?

186
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:01,520
Yes.

187
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:04,940
Let me go!
Where's the heck is this place?

188
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:07,160
- Where am I?
- Please calm down.

189
00:23:11,750 --> 00:23:14,040
Speaking of which, who are you people?

190
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:16,460
Who cares about that.

191
00:23:16,970 --> 00:23:19,020
I was an office worker.

192
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:24,520
For the last 20 years, I have worked
for the company every day.

193
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:28,700
Well, I was dismissed because of
a restructure though.

194
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:31,850
I'm a nurse.

195
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:34,900
That's during the day.
At night, she's a hostess.

196
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:36,890
You lie about you age, right?

197
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:40,630
This auntie's still popular at this age.
Can you believe it?

198
00:23:41,060 --> 00:23:43,340
He's women's enemy even during the day.

199
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:47,480
I'm a freeter. Right now, I'm working
part-time at a curry shop.

200
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:50,700
It's a small shop, but the food is delicious.

201
00:23:52,820 --> 00:23:57,250
I'm a system engineer
at this company named Orient.

202
00:23:57,250 --> 00:23:59,090
Please contact me if need be.

203
00:24:00,290 --> 00:24:02,310
And, how about you?

204
00:24:04,580 --> 00:24:05,760
I'm a hairdresser.

205
00:24:08,830 --> 00:24:12,220
Kurono-san is really
a normal university student?

206
00:24:14,260 --> 00:24:18,010
Since... you're really strong and everything.

207
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:21,890
He is, indeed.

208
00:24:22,980 --> 00:24:23,890
Why are you so strong?

209
00:24:26,620 --> 00:24:28,680
Because there's someone I want to revive.

210
00:24:30,420 --> 00:24:31,100
GANTZ.

211
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:44,550
He was one of us before.
He fought with us.

212
00:24:45,780 --> 00:24:48,850
Kurono-kun wants to revive him.

213
00:24:50,590 --> 00:24:54,080
But... not only him.

214
00:24:56,020 --> 00:24:58,410
I want to revive everyone who's died here.

215
00:24:59,970 --> 00:25:04,580
And then, let us all be released from here
and become free together.

216
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:17,630
[Nakamura]
[Special trait: Noisy]
[Favorite thing: Jogging]

217
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:23,490
[You got the third key]

218
00:25:22,490 --> 00:25:23,490
[You got the third key]

219
00:25:26,750 --> 00:25:30,010
[You got the third key]

220
00:25:29,970 --> 00:25:33,070
[One more left, and you can go back]

221
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:41,270
[The last key is this person.]

00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:58,950
[Kojima Tae]

223

[Special trait: Weak]
[Favorite thing: Kurono-kun]

224
00:26:06,230 --> 00:26:08,080
Did you come on time the other day?

225
00:26:08,860 --> 00:26:10,830
Hmm? For what?

226
00:26:11,970 --> 00:26:12,840
Your part-time job?

227
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:17,310
Part-time...? Oh, yeah I did.

228
00:26:19,430 --> 00:26:20,760
Tough, isn't it?

229
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:25,770
It is. There is this person named Suzuki,
and for some reason she didn't turn up.

230
00:26:26,230 --> 00:26:30,490
That's why the shop didn't have enough
people, so they just called me out.

231
00:26:34,710 --> 00:26:35,700
What's wrong?

232
00:26:38,010 --> 00:26:41,140
Kurono-kun, did something good happen?

233
00:26:47,430 --> 00:26:48,550
There's something, right?

234
00:26:50,470 --> 00:26:51,230
You can tell?

235
00:26:52,410 --> 00:26:53,140
What? What?

236
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:57,250
Well actually, I was gonna tell Ayumu.

237
00:26:58,360 --> 00:26:59,820
Katou is gonna come home soon.

238
00:27:01,820 --> 00:27:02,750
Eh?

239
00:27:05,410 --> 00:27:07,260
He's been contacting you?

240
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:08,400
Hm?

241
00:27:10,460 --> 00:27:11,600
Katou asked me...

242
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:13,600
...to keep it from other people.

243
00:27:15,230 --> 00:27:16,840
I see.

244
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:22,100
More importantly, there's some information
I want to give Kojima-san...

245
00:27:22,410 --> 00:27:23,850
Well, "information" isn't exactly the word...

246
00:27:28,850 --> 00:27:30,260
Wanna go to amusement park?

247
00:27:34,460 --> 00:27:34,850
Let's go?

248
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:37,190
Just the two of us, once in a while.

249
00:27:41,220 --> 00:27:45,050
You mean... that time I confessed to you?

250
00:27:45,710 --> 00:27:46,630
That was...

251
00:27:48,990 --> 00:27:51,080
I told you it was
just at the surge of the moment.

252
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:54,990
Please forget about it.

253
00:27:55,380 --> 00:27:56,760
How can I forget it?

254
00:27:57,030 --> 00:27:58,710
Hey, let's go.

255
00:27:58,790 --> 00:28:00,260
Impossible, impossible.

256
00:28:00,450 --> 00:28:01,430
Absolutely impossible.

257
00:28:02,590 --> 00:28:05,410
I have acrophobia.

258
00:28:06,020 --> 00:28:09,130
I can't handle the ferris wheel
or roller coaster at all...

259
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:12,750
Look.

260
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:17,020
You even drew it in your sketchbook, right?
The scene at the amusement park?

261
00:28:18,410 --> 00:28:23,390
Maybe if you go there, it can become
your source to draw manga.

262
00:28:25,450 --> 00:28:26,060
Then...

263
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:28,970
There's one condition.

264
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:30,480
What is it?

265
00:28:34,710 --> 00:28:37,130
Please start calling me
by my first name from now on.

266
00:28:37,130 --> 00:28:38,010
Eh?

267
00:28:39,180 --> 00:28:40,360
Call me now.

268
00:28:44,060 --> 00:28:45,150
Please.

269
00:28:46,730 --> 00:28:50,370
Well, that's a little...

270
00:28:51,370 --> 00:28:53,920
Maybe now is not the right time.

271
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:58,170
The next time we meet,
I'll call you that, ok?

272
00:29:03,270 --> 00:29:06,460
I'll definitely call you that when we
met at the amusement park.

273
00:29:14,650 --> 00:29:14,960
Yes.

274
00:29:17,050 --> 00:29:17,520
Definitely.

275
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:25,580
See you.

276
00:29:59,610 --> 00:30:01,420
Welcome back, Kei-chan.

277
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:08,360
How are you alive?

278
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:17,370
GANTZ did something?

279
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:28,440
You don't remember?

280
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:29,320
How many people are there?

281
00:30:35,420 --> 00:30:38,940
Eight people, including me.

282
00:30:39,850 --> 00:30:41,790
Recently, we got three more people.

283
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:49,630
GANTZ...

284
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:51,720
I want to put an end to it.

285
00:30:53,530 --> 00:30:54,360
How?

286
00:30:57,330 --> 00:31:01,400
You don't know?
There's a ball this big.

287
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:08,720
No idea.

288
00:31:14,010 --> 00:31:15,750
I'll come again.

289
00:31:15,930 --> 00:31:17,760
If you know something, tell me.

290
00:31:54,190 --> 00:31:56,070
GANTZ, show me people who've died.

291
00:31:59,900 --> 00:32:00,900
What's the matter?

292
00:32:01,010 --> 00:32:02,290
Katou was revived.

293
00:32:02,650 --> 00:32:04,310
Eh? How come?

294
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:07,660
Well, I don't know about that.
But look, he's still in here.

295
00:32:11,650 --> 00:32:13,300
What is going on?

296

299
00:32:31,490 --> 00:32:32,530
What?

300
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:46,170
Um...

301
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:52,030
I'm Kojima, Kurono-kun's classmate
at the college.

302
00:33:04,110 --> 00:33:05,560
Ayumu-kun, come see him.

303
00:33:08,330 --> 00:33:09,140
Ayumu-kun?

304
00:33:10,180 --> 00:33:12,970
What's so important that you
even neglect your younger brother?

305
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:16,300
It's because you have work to do, right?

306
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:18,300
I'm asking you, Nii-chan.

307
00:33:21,250 --> 00:33:21,880
Because I have work.

308
00:33:23,150 --> 00:33:24,020
Really?

309
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:26,650
Really.

310
00:33:27,690 --> 00:33:28,330
Oh, yeah?

311
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:36,910
Should I go back?

312
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:46,600
There are things you can't talk
when I'm here, so...

313
00:33:46,820 --> 00:33:47,690
I'm taking my leave.

314
00:33:50,750 --> 00:33:52,160

when you weren't home.

This is Kojima.

320
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:23,100
Erm, Ayumu-kun's brother
came home earlier.

321
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:26,450
And also, there's something I want to ask...

322
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:31,250
About the amusement park, Ayumu-kun
and his brother are coming too...

323
00:35:31,620 --> 00:35:33,790
That's why, it won't be a date.

324
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:37,260
I want to see you.

325
00:35:38,730 --> 00:35:40,610

I stopped this after my child was born.

334

I have to get released soon for
the sake of my family.

Take care of the front part of the train.

357
00:43:13,420 --> 00:43:14,990
Ayukawa Eriko?

358
00:43:15,110 --> 00:43:16,600
She's riding the train by herself?

359
00:43:32,660 --> 00:43:36,600
Everyone, we are not
a suspicious group of people.

360
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:38,620
We are not doing anything to harm you either.

361
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:44,480
What? Is it like an event or something?

362
00:44:02,460 --> 00:44:03,210
Kurono-san!

363
00:44:03,420 --> 00:44:05,690
Don't shoot!
Don't drag others into this!

364
00:44:05,740 --> 00:44:06,720
Can you hear people screaming?

365
00:44:07,940 --> 00:44:08,970
It smells weird too.

366
00:44:11,950 --> 00:44:15,130
What the? What's going on?
Isn't this dangerous?

367
00:45:19,620 --> 00:45:20,150
Takahashi!

368
00:46:18,580 --> 00:46:20,620
You guys are so amazing.

369
00:46:22,590 --> 00:46:23,400
Damn it.

370
00:46:24,060 --> 00:46:25,020
I remember...

371
00:46:25,930 --> 00:46:27,390
I remember!

372
00:46:44,510 --> 00:46:45,420
I remember.

373
00:46:45,980 --> 00:46:47,560
I've done the same thing before.

374
00:46:48,340 --> 00:46:49,150
What?

375
00:46:49,260 --> 00:46:52,190
The two who were in the room before,
Nakamura-san and Kobayashi-san too.

376
00:46:52,950 --> 00:46:54,130
Eh?

377
00:46:57,330 --> 00:46:59,600
Stop! It's dangerous here!

378
00:46:59,630 --> 00:47:00,560
Out of the way!

379
00:47:37,840 --> 00:47:38,420
Come.

380
00:49:58,430 --> 00:50:00,130
Kurono Kei.

381
00:50:39,640 --> 00:50:40,700
Kurono-kun?

382
00:50:49,490 --> 00:50:50,600
Run away from here.

383
00:51:02,060 --> 00:51:03,020
Wait.

384
00:51:07,870 --> 00:51:08,880
Sorry.

385
00:55:39,290 --> 00:55:40,440
Stop it!

386
00:55:55,670 --> 00:55:58,240
You're heavy. Move aside.

387
00:56:00,670 --> 00:56:02,230
I'm covering for you.

388
00:56:05,010 --> 00:56:07,100
She's tough.

389
00:56:07,440 --> 00:56:08,290
Yeah.

390
00:57:15,860 --> 00:57:17,070
This is revenge.

391
00:57:27,020 --> 00:57:28,030
This is revenge.

392
00:57:31,060 --> 00:57:33,440
You people were the ones
who started this first.

393
00:57:34,750 --> 00:57:37,980
You people have killed
so many of my friends.

394
00:57:43,230 --> 00:57:46,670
I'll never forgive you-

395
00:58:16,790 --> 00:58:18,780
Everyone's safe, right?

396
00:58:20,680 --> 00:58:21,590
Auntie isn't here.

397
00:58:26,490 --> 00:58:28,330
[Well then, let's see the points]

398
00:58:31,450 --> 00:58:32,670
Hold on a second.

399
00:58:33,700 --> 00:58:35,240
Oi!

403
00:58:45,930 --> 00:58:46,940
Oi.

404
00:58:49,920 --> 00:58:51,050
I told you Auntie isn't here.

405
00:58:52,800 --> 00:58:53,930
Auntie isn't here!

406
00:58:54,790 --> 00:58:56,360
Auntie isn't here!

407
00:58:57,040 --> 00:58:59,240

"The black sphere...
and the room that contains it."

415
01:00:23,070 --> 01:00:24,330
Black sphere?

01:00:28,200 --> 01:00:29,450
Room?

417
01:00:36,750 --> 01:00:37,480
GANTZ!

01:00:53,350 --> 01:00:54,300
[It totally depends on me how to use your life]

419
01:00:54,780 --> 01:00:57,400
[That's on theory.]

420
01:01:25,260 --> 01:01:26,660
This is revenge.

That's her, right?

425
01:02:32,320 --> 01:02:33,380
Is this for real?

426
01:02:34,060 --> 01:02:34,950
Isn't that Ayukawa?

427
01:02:35,500 --> 01:02:37,650
Ayukawa... Eriko?

428
01:02:38,280 --> 01:02:40,130
You finally came, huh?

429
01:02:40,750 --> 01:02:41,740
Yes.

430
01:02:43,200 --> 01:02:44,140
Seems so.

This woman... was the one who killed me.

434
01:03:00,020 --> 01:03:03,810
Long time no see, Kobayashi-san.

435
01:03:05,770 --> 01:03:06,680
Huh?

436
01:03:07,800 --> 01:03:11,830
Kobayashi-san,
don't you remember this room?

437
01:03:13,580 --> 01:03:15,220
You don't remember me?

438
01:03:15,870 --> 01:03:17,250

We defeated these aliens dressed in black...

...two years ago in Shibuya.

And then, everyone could stop doing this.

448
01:03:55,850 --> 01:03:59,810
We had our memory erased...
and were set free.

449
01:04:04,260 --> 01:04:05,560
Ah...

450
01:04:07,260 --> 01:04:07,690
Yes.

451
01:04:08,950 --> 01:04:11,280
So if we get 100 points,
we can really be released, huh?

460
01:05:23,290 --> 01:05:27,910
Suzuki-san, with this, you'll be a free man.

461
01:05:31,550 --> 01:05:33,140
I'll choose the second option.

I'm sorry.

464
01:05:59,290 --> 01:06:02,630
First of all, let's revive Katou-kun.

465
01:06:03,760 --> 01:06:04,390
No...

466
01:06:05,230 --> 01:06:06,490
But, he...

467
01:06:08,180 --> 01:06:10,910
I was... killed by him.

468
01:06:12,900 --> 01:06:17,120
"This is revenge. You people killed my friends."
He said that and killed me.

469
01:06:18,280 --> 01:06:20,190
That's the same thing
as what the girl said earlier.

470
01:06:20,300 --> 01:06:24,220
Then... this Katou is?

471
01:06:29,240 --> 01:06:30,350
Let's confirm it.

01:08:59,880 --> 01:09:00,990
What happened to it?

487
01:09:12,760 --> 01:09:16,670
Was I... dead?

488
01:09:25,460 --> 01:09:26,740
Was I alive?

489
01:09:33,160 --> 01:09:34,790
I'm alive, and I can go back.

490
01:09:42,030 --> 01:09:43,700
Suzuki-san used his points to revive you.

491
01:09:46,400 --> 01:09:50,210
It's nothing. Well, it's been
my objective from the beginning...

492
01:09:50,210 --> 01:09:53,010
...to get 100 points and revive Katou-kun.

493
01:09:58,220 --> 01:09:59,130
Thank you very much.

494
01:10:00,980 --> 01:10:02,060

Ah, it's nothing.

496
01:10:07,600 --> 01:10:10,710
Anyway, with this,
we've made it clear, right?

Yes.

498
01:10:15,430 --> 01:10:16,820
The other guy is an alien.

499
01:11:04,180 --> 01:11:05,790

I have you revived.

01:12:34,700 --> 01:12:35,870
I was dead?

510
01:12:35,870 --> 01:12:37,100
Yeah.

511
01:12:38,470 --> 01:12:40,130
That's so uncool!

512
01:12:42,160 --> 01:12:44,080
Right now, you're important to us.

513
01:12:44,580 --> 01:12:45,540
Now, explain to us.

514
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:47,200
Something strange is happening to GANTZ.

515
01:12:49,780 --> 01:12:50,980
You guys...

516
01:12:54,820 --> 01:12:55,530
Long time no see.

517
01:12:56,600 --> 01:12:58,620
You're still doing this, huh?

518
01:12:59,310 --> 01:13:00,440
Why are you here?

519
01:13:01,640 --> 01:13:03,160
We were summoned by GANTZ.

520
01:13:04,590 --> 01:13:07,740
A black ball was sent to my place.

521
01:13:08,630 --> 01:13:11,640
Ex-members like us
were brought back here.

522
01:13:12,450 --> 01:13:13,520
That's not the only thing.

523
01:13:15,510 --> 01:13:18,130
There were people who were dragged into
the mission and got killed.

524
01:13:19,210 --> 01:13:20,770
This has never happened before.

525
01:13:21,380 --> 01:13:21,830
Say,

526
01:13:23,410 --> 01:13:24,500
what's going on now?

527
01:13:34,090 --> 01:13:36,280
How long have I been dead?

528
01:13:38,440 --> 01:13:39,130
Five months.

529
01:13:42,020 --> 01:13:43,770
It's gathering people because of this?

530
01:13:44,910 --> 01:13:45,820
What is it?

531
01:13:46,940 --> 01:13:48,130
Oi, spill it.

532
01:13:52,560 --> 01:13:55,440
GANTZ runs using battery.

533
01:13:55,850 --> 01:13:56,720
Huh?

534
01:13:57,290 --> 01:13:59,440
This thing runs using battery?

535
01:14:00,610 --> 01:14:03,930
From what I observe,
even though this is just a guess...

536
01:14:04,630 --> 01:14:06,570
GANTZ moves by sucking his energy.

537
01:14:08,130 --> 01:14:09,940
That's why, if this bald-headed guy
wakes up,

538
01:14:10,960 --> 01:14:13,180
it's also the end of GANTZ.

539
01:14:14,530 --> 01:14:18,000
If GANTZ dies, what will happen to us?

540
01:14:19,030 --> 01:14:22,650
That is...
Right?

541
01:14:24,120 --> 01:14:27,440
Extermination... perhaps.

542
01:14:28,800 --> 01:14:31,180
We, who were revived by GANTZ...

543
01:14:31,580 --> 01:14:33,650
...will also disappear together with it.

544
01:14:34,290 --> 01:14:35,880
What the heck is that?

545
01:14:35,970 --> 01:14:37,530
Maybe GANTZ is rushing too.

546
01:14:38,150 --> 01:14:41,160
Before its lifetime ends, it wants
to defeat all the aliens.

547
01:14:41,710 --> 01:14:44,160
That's why it summoned us
ex-members here.

548
01:14:44,540 --> 01:14:48,670
I see what you mean.
So it's like homecoming, huh?

549
01:14:49,360 --> 01:14:50,410
Perhaps...

550
01:14:53,060 --> 01:14:56,150
...the archrival still remains.
The Last Boss, that is.

551
01:14:57,250 --> 01:14:58,780
Don't tell me...

552
01:14:59,400 --> 01:14:59,970
...that is...?

553
01:15:02,860 --> 01:15:05,810
Today I met an alien who appeared
in the form of your body.

554
01:15:07,010 --> 01:15:07,810
Eh?

555
01:15:08,180 --> 01:15:10,650
The one who killed me is also...
...that guy.

556
01:15:27,400 --> 01:15:28,000
He's an alien.

557
01:15:42,570 --> 01:15:43,010
There it goes again.

558
01:15:44,010 --> 01:15:47,430
"A new morning has come"

559
01:15:47,710 --> 01:15:51,370
"It's a morning of hope"

560
01:15:51,650 --> 01:15:55,170
"Open your heart with joy"

561
01:15:55,460 --> 01:15:57,230
Today's mission just ended though.

562
01:15:55,480 --> 01:15:59,180
"Look up to the blue sky"

563
01:15:59,450 --> 01:16:02,910
"Listen to the radio"

564
01:16:03,460 --> 01:16:07,050
"Take a deep breath"

565
01:16:07,330 --> 01:16:10,960
"And take in the fragrance
of the wind"

566
01:16:11,230 --> 01:16:14,960
"And then - one, two, three"

567
01:16:19,190 --> 01:16:24,800
[Emergency mission]
[Go crush this person]

568
01:16:39,500 --> 01:16:46,740
[Kojima Tae]

569
01:16:42,500 --> 01:16:46,740
[Special trait: Weak]
[Favorite thing: Kurono-kun]

570
01:16:43,110 --> 01:16:44,140
What the heck?

571
01:16:44,540 --> 01:16:45,500
An ordinary girl?

572
01:16:45,880 --> 01:16:46,540
Wait, look...

573
01:16:47,220 --> 01:16:47,900
Her favorite thing is...

574
01:16:51,410 --> 01:16:53,160
What the heck is this?

575
01:16:54,290 --> 01:16:56,200
Why is she the target?

576
01:16:57,780 --> 01:16:59,700
Shouldn't it be that fake Katou?

577
01:17:05,150 --> 01:17:09,670
[People who crushed her will get 100 points.]
[The others will have their points taken away.]

578
01:17:15,520 --> 01:17:16,570
This girl is...

579
01:17:17,800 --> 01:17:20,550
Kojima Tae is not an alien.

580
01:17:22,620 --> 01:17:23,510
That's why...

581
01:17:26,330 --> 01:17:27,490
...please don't kill her.

582
01:17:29,870 --> 01:17:30,880
Please.

583
01:17:31,480 --> 01:17:35,100
She may look like that, but
she might actually be an alien.

584
01:17:35,100 --> 01:17:35,640
That's not true!

585
01:17:36,770 --> 01:17:39,240
The last person who appeared
on the black ball...

586
01:17:40,280 --> 01:17:41,610
...was this girl.

587
01:17:42,750 --> 01:17:45,630
So that means... she's also
an ex-member of the group?

588
01:17:46,340 --> 01:17:49,040
No. I've never seen her.

589
01:17:50,430 --> 01:17:52,710
Then... she's really an alien?

590
01:17:53,650 --> 01:17:54,530
Hang on.

591
01:17:55,560 --> 01:17:57,000
Where is that ball now?

592
01:17:57,920 --> 01:17:59,480
The one who killed me...

593
01:18:04,660 --> 01:18:06,800
So it's with that Katou alien, huh?

594
01:18:11,030 --> 01:18:12,160
Isn't that bad?

595
01:18:13,070 --> 01:18:15,400
Maybe he already killed
Kojima Tae before us.

596
01:18:16,500 --> 01:18:19,430
The ones who hold the ball
can be transmitted around.

597
01:18:19,770 --> 01:18:20,570
Seriously?

598
01:18:20,750 --> 01:18:23,570
GANTZ wants to prevent that, right?

599
01:18:24,530 --> 01:18:25,260
Anyway...

600
01:18:25,990 --> 01:18:28,750
...if it's GANTZ's order, we just have to do it.

601
01:18:35,600 --> 01:18:37,880
If I can get 100 points by killing
this one girl,

602
01:18:39,110 --> 01:18:40,450
I'll kill Kojima Tae.

603
01:19:00,590 --> 01:19:01,100
GANTZ.

604
01:19:02,460 --> 01:19:04,270
Transmit me first.

605
01:19:05,150 --> 01:19:05,710
Kei-chan.

606
01:19:06,660 --> 01:19:09,760
I'll go to Kojima-san.
You go to Ayumu's place.

607
01:19:10,520 --> 01:19:12,310
Sorry. I'll see you later.

608
01:19:12,860 --> 01:19:13,590
Be careful.

609
01:19:15,230 --> 01:19:15,780
Wait.

610
01:19:18,280 --> 01:19:19,990
You intend to protect her?

611
01:19:36,960 --> 01:19:39,360
I want to revive Auntie.

612
01:19:41,470 --> 01:19:42,510
That's why...

613
01:19:43,970 --> 01:19:45,050
...I have to gain more points.

614
01:19:46,970 --> 01:19:47,830
Stop it!

615
01:19:51,580 --> 01:19:53,160
Transmit me quickly.

616
01:19:58,060 --> 01:19:59,040
GANTZ!

617
01:20:14,120 --> 01:20:15,380
My house?

618
01:20:35,770 --> 01:20:37,350
I will explain everything to you later.

619
01:20:38,420 --> 01:20:39,400
Right now, let's run away together.

620
01:20:41,420 --> 01:20:44,140
Um, what happened in the subway earlier...

621
01:20:44,830 --> 01:20:46,650
It didn't make any sense at all.

622
01:20:47,380 --> 01:20:48,900
But I believe...

623
01:20:50,110 --> 01:20:52,220
I believe you, Kurono-kun.

624
01:21:06,550 --> 01:21:07,120
This way!

625
01:21:09,220 --> 01:21:10,620
Wasn't that Ayumu-kun's brother?

626
01:21:10,620 --> 01:21:10,920
It wasn't him!

627
01:21:38,080 --> 01:21:41,590
Urgent! Urgent! Calling headquarters.
Found one suspect just now.

628
01:21:42,080 --> 01:21:44,130
The suspect is heading
towards the north direction.

629
01:21:44,520 --> 01:21:46,530
The suspect is a man who possesses
a weapon and is chasing after someone else.

630
01:21:48,440 --> 01:21:50,180
Quickly send more backups to the subway.

631
01:21:50,350 --> 01:21:51,600
"Roger."

632
01:23:48,070 --> 01:23:49,460
Found you.

633
01:23:54,660 --> 01:23:55,750
Kurono-kun.

634
01:24:10,390 --> 01:24:11,330
Let's stop this.

635
01:24:12,240 --> 01:24:13,330
If GANTZ dies,

636
01:24:13,650 --> 01:24:14,850
everyone will be exterminated.

637
01:24:15,980 --> 01:24:18,210
Doing this to another human being
is just strange.

638
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:22,160
Though you can kill so many aliens?

639
01:24:26,650 --> 01:24:27,410
Suzuki-san.

640
01:24:28,510 --> 01:24:29,840
Since I'm thrown into this,

641
01:24:30,290 --> 01:24:31,910
before GANTZ comes to an end,

642
01:24:32,810 --> 01:24:34,020
I will get 100 points one more time.

643
01:24:36,010 --> 01:24:36,790
Nice.

644
01:24:43,100 --> 01:24:43,850
Kurono-san.

645
01:24:44,880 --> 01:24:45,640
Run away.

646
01:24:46,590 --> 01:24:47,650
If you move, we'll shoot.

647
01:24:50,660 --> 01:24:53,080
No, you won't.

648
01:25:09,970 --> 01:25:11,000
Suzuki-san too!

649
01:25:11,570 --> 01:25:12,200
Me too?

650
01:25:18,990 --> 01:25:20,520
They're shooting!

651
01:25:36,530 --> 01:25:37,670
Please go first.

652
01:25:37,990 --> 01:25:38,970
I will block them.

653
01:25:39,480 --> 01:25:40,480
Sakurai-kun!

654
01:25:41,530 --> 01:25:43,300
They won't get any points killing me.

655
01:25:45,790 --> 01:25:48,110
Hurry up! I'll catch up with you later.

656
01:25:50,070 --> 01:25:50,610
Thanks.

657
01:26:10,130 --> 01:26:11,710
I'll aim at him for real.

658
01:27:27,720 --> 01:27:28,130
Let's go.

659
01:27:39,410 --> 01:27:40,950
[Katou]

660
01:27:42,640 --> 01:27:43,490
Ayumu.

661
01:27:45,210 --> 01:27:45,820
Ayumu!

662
01:28:31,970 --> 01:28:32,460
Ayumu.

663
01:28:34,860 --> 01:28:35,740
Ayumu.

664
01:28:38,050 --> 01:28:38,750
Ayumu...

665
01:29:22,200 --> 01:29:23,340
Calling headquarters.

666
01:29:23,660 --> 01:29:25,650
Right now, the suspect is heading further
to the north direction.

667
01:29:25,650 --> 01:29:26,900
I'm chasing after him.

668
01:30:13,330 --> 01:30:15,090
It's me, Kei-chan.

669
01:30:18,240 --> 01:30:19,020
By any chance...

670
01:30:19,440 --> 01:30:20,100
...he is...?

671
01:30:20,780 --> 01:30:21,550
Suzuki-san.

672
01:30:22,310 --> 01:30:25,260
The two of you, please get as far away
from Tokyo as you can.

673
01:30:30,400 --> 01:30:31,030
Hurry up!

674
01:30:32,560 --> 01:30:34,740
I don't want to go!
I want to be with you, Kurono-kun.

675
01:30:34,740 --> 01:30:35,380
Tae-chan.

676
01:30:38,910 --> 01:30:40,820
I will definitely come pick you up later.

677
01:30:45,700 --> 01:30:46,630
Let's go.

678
01:31:01,380 --> 01:31:02,240
Let's make sure...

679
01:31:04,770 --> 01:31:05,750
...we go to the amusement park.

680
01:31:42,010 --> 01:31:42,860
This way!

681
01:32:09,590 --> 01:32:11,860
Don't... get in my way.

682
01:32:24,570 --> 01:32:26,060
You came to take revenge?

683
01:32:57,520 --> 01:33:01,210
Why did you... have to kill Ayumu?

684
01:33:03,260 --> 01:33:05,260
You also killed your father.

685
01:34:04,930 --> 01:34:06,580
Give Ayumu back!

686
01:34:15,730 --> 01:34:17,470
Someone who killed his father like you...

687
01:34:20,020 --> 01:34:22,420
...can get angry when your brother is killed?

688
01:34:31,950 --> 01:34:36,190
Because of those emotions...
you killed your father.

689
01:34:36,800 --> 01:34:38,900
That was to save Ayumu.
It couldn't be helped!

690
01:34:38,900 --> 01:34:39,740
It couldn't be helped?

691
01:34:41,250 --> 01:34:42,810
That's forever your excuse.

692
01:34:45,280 --> 01:34:49,440
You always make that excuse...
and run away from everything.

693
01:34:51,400 --> 01:34:51,810
Katou!

694
01:35:05,230 --> 01:35:06,160
Kei-chan.

695
01:36:13,970 --> 01:36:15,180
Please tell me.

696
01:36:21,550 --> 01:36:25,930
What's happening to Kurono-kun?

697
01:36:36,080 --> 01:36:38,190
It's hard to explain, but...

698
01:36:42,970 --> 01:36:44,310
He's fighting...

699
01:36:45,890 --> 01:36:47,270
...to protect you.

700
01:36:50,150 --> 01:36:52,990
For... my sake?

701
01:36:55,120 --> 01:36:58,060
He might... even die.

702
01:37:22,060 --> 01:37:23,030
I'm sorry.

703
01:37:26,110 --> 01:37:28,080
My wife passed away.

704
01:37:32,380 --> 01:37:33,440
I want to get her back.

705
01:37:37,160 --> 01:37:41,310
I have to gain enough points before GANTZ is over.

706
01:37:59,070 --> 01:38:00,280
Please run away.

707
01:38:01,050 --> 01:38:03,640
If not, I will have to shoot you.

708
01:38:04,720 --> 01:38:08,370
Kurono-kun will definitely come to pick you up.

709
01:38:40,670 --> 01:38:41,910
It doesn't work on him at all.

710
01:38:57,350 --> 01:38:57,900
This way!

711
01:39:15,100 --> 01:39:17,290
You're in the way. Move aside!

712
01:39:19,270 --> 01:39:20,300
I give up!

713
01:39:22,080 --> 01:39:23,010
Let's stop.

714
01:39:23,720 --> 01:39:24,620
Let's stop here.

715
01:39:25,300 --> 01:39:25,730
Okay?

716
01:39:39,790 --> 01:39:41,050
What are you shooting?

717
01:39:42,250 --> 01:39:43,640
But...

718
01:39:44,460 --> 01:39:44,940
But...

719
01:39:45,230 --> 01:39:45,910
...he-

720
01:40:08,850 --> 01:40:09,480
[Kojima Tae]

721
01:40:14,200 --> 01:40:17,810
someone saying something

722
01:40:18,270 --> 01:40:20,030
the same someone saying something again

723
01:41:01,390 --> 01:41:01,840
Oi.

724
01:41:04,350 --> 01:41:05,190
Oi!

725
01:41:07,180 --> 01:41:08,060
Oi!!

726
01:42:37,030 --> 01:42:39,060
You want to know why I killed your brother?

727
01:43:01,880 --> 01:43:02,720
This is revenge.

728
01:43:06,680 --> 01:43:08,160
You people did the same thing to me.

729
01:43:14,000 --> 01:43:17,410
We tasted the same hatred...

730
01:43:15,910 --> 01:43:17,410
...and sorrow.

731
01:43:19,160 --> 01:43:20,610
Like me, you people are...

732
01:43:21,070 --> 01:43:23,430
...not fighting for anyone's sake,

733
01:43:23,950 --> 01:43:25,390
Nor are you protecting anyone.

734
01:43:26,410 --> 01:43:29,280
You're just...

735
01:43:30,440 --> 01:43:32,130
...being controlled by that black sphere.

736
01:45:00,200 --> 01:45:00,940
Katou.

737
01:45:27,250 --> 01:45:28,430
Kurono-kun!

738
01:45:37,980 --> 01:45:39,450
No way...

739
01:45:53,190 --> 01:45:55,040
Kurono-kun.

740
01:46:03,550 --> 01:46:05,030
I got you.

741
01:47:46,480 --> 01:47:48,270
Kurono-kun.

742
01:47:51,840 --> 01:47:53,220
Tae-chan.

743
01:47:54,530 --> 01:47:56,410
Let's go home.

744
01:48:00,180 --> 01:48:00,920
You mustn't...

745
01:48:03,110 --> 01:48:04,160
You mustn't die.

746
01:48:10,220 --> 01:48:11,150
Kei-chan.

747
01:48:15,350 --> 01:48:16,300
Kei-chan.

748
01:50:38,840 --> 01:50:41,460
So you're saying that I should keep...

749
01:50:43,270 --> 01:50:44,960
...fighting until forever?

750
01:50:54,930 --> 01:50:56,710
That's why, you...

751
01:51:01,820 --> 01:51:03,350
...made Tae-chan your target?

752
01:52:22,030 --> 01:52:23,870
You can go to that room using it, right?

753
01:52:29,110 --> 01:52:30,200
Hand the ball to me.

754
01:52:42,530 --> 01:52:45,050
[Mission cleared.]

755
01:53:43,560 --> 01:53:45,410
[Damn it Damn it Damn it]

756
01:53:53,100 --> 01:53:57,050
[Someone, crush the alien in this room]

757
01:53:57,760 --> 01:53:58,960
In here?

758
01:54:01,490 --> 01:54:02,490
Not here.

759
01:54:03,440 --> 01:54:06,960
The ones who were supposed
to have been killed by the alien earlier are...

760
01:54:29,150 --> 01:54:30,530
We finally found you.

761
01:54:50,040 --> 01:54:52,120
It is you who wished to start this fight.

762
01:55:19,000 --> 01:55:19,830
[Start]

763
01:58:45,810 --> 01:58:48,470
I understand now, GANTZ.

764
01:58:55,400 --> 01:58:56,280
[Choose]

765
01:59:03,910 --> 01:59:04,900
Kei-chan.

766
01:59:20,580 --> 01:59:21,780
How about the aliens?

767
01:59:23,770 --> 01:59:27,070
I don't think all of them have died.

768
01:59:29,110 --> 01:59:30,280
That's great.

769
01:59:31,710 --> 01:59:32,740
That's great?

770
01:59:37,670 --> 01:59:42,350
Because we have to get more points.

771
02:00:10,890 --> 02:00:12,510
What do humans fight for?

772
02:00:20,580 --> 02:00:22,180
What do you people fight for?

773
02:00:24,930 --> 02:00:26,380
For the sake of my loved ones.

774
02:00:30,740 --> 02:00:32,140
When are you gonna keep fighting until?

775
02:00:34,280 --> 02:00:38,850
Until... I can revive my wife.

776
02:00:51,910 --> 02:00:52,850
Stop it.

777
02:01:04,350 --> 02:01:05,640
I have to live.

778
02:01:08,160 --> 02:01:08,970
I...

779
02:01:11,160 --> 02:01:14,200
People in this world are longing to see me.

780
02:01:30,430 --> 02:01:31,640
You're kidding, right?

781
02:01:33,820 --> 02:01:34,600
GANTZ.

782
02:01:44,930 --> 02:01:46,160
Stop it.

783
02:01:56,110 --> 02:01:56,680
Shoot.

784
02:02:01,350 --> 02:02:03,600
I can't stop this fight with you people.

785
02:02:08,790 --> 02:02:09,490
Shoot!

786
02:02:28,370 --> 02:02:28,990
Stop...

787
02:02:32,270 --> 02:02:33,040
...already

788
02:02:40,400 --> 02:02:43,940
Let's... stop this.

789
02:04:07,350 --> 02:04:08,300
Why?

790
02:04:11,480 --> 02:04:13,180
There's no way but to kill him.

791
02:04:25,230 --> 02:04:25,940
Kei-chan.

792
02:04:39,160 --> 02:04:43,100
[Well then, let's see the points]

793
02:04:46,000 --> 02:04:51,630
[Kurono]
[Full points]

794
02:04:51,630 --> 02:04:54,620
[Please choose from the "full points" menu.]

795
02:04:58,980 --> 02:05:00,860
[Full points menu~]
[Forever...]

796
02:05:07,970 --> 02:05:11,100
Oi! What's next?

797
02:05:13,550 --> 02:05:14,510
What is it?

798
02:05:23,050 --> 02:05:23,830
GANTZ is...

799
02:05:26,920 --> 02:05:27,670
...over?

800
02:05:36,510 --> 02:05:37,210
With this...

801
02:05:40,170 --> 02:05:42,040
...no one will be revived.

802
02:05:46,340 --> 02:05:47,320
Neither will us.

803
02:05:49,240 --> 02:05:49,860
No.

804
02:05:51,920 --> 02:05:54,350
There's still... a way out.

805
02:06:03,290 --> 02:06:04,020
Kei-chan.

806
02:06:06,610 --> 02:06:07,610
GANTZ...

807
02:06:10,960 --> 02:06:11,940
...has decided already.

808
02:06:17,830 --> 02:06:19,930
[Kurono-kun]
[Thank you]

809
02:06:24,570 --> 02:06:25,220
Kei-chan?

810
02:06:26,180 --> 02:06:27,620
What did you do?

811
02:06:32,060 --> 02:06:33,630
Everything will end.

812
02:06:36,510 --> 02:06:40,490
No one will be summoned here anymore.

813
02:06:48,480 --> 02:06:49,960
You've gotta be kidding me!

814
02:06:51,140 --> 02:06:52,780
What did you do?

815
02:06:57,760 --> 02:06:58,360
Katou.

816
02:07:02,510 --> 02:07:03,870
Thank you so much...

817
02:07:06,370 --> 02:07:08,390
...for remembering our childhood together.

818
02:07:09,710 --> 02:07:10,310
I...

819
02:07:12,520 --> 02:07:14,350
...was really happy.

820
02:07:22,810 --> 02:07:23,490
But...

821
02:07:25,810 --> 02:07:27,400
...from now on, forget about me.

822
02:07:32,580 --> 02:07:34,000
How can I forget?

823
02:07:34,090 --> 02:07:35,540
How can I forget??

824
02:07:38,440 --> 02:07:39,210
Katou.

825
02:07:47,360 --> 02:07:49,180
Take good care of Ayumu.

826
02:07:52,600 --> 02:07:54,300
We're going back together!

827
02:07:54,750 --> 02:07:56,200
Together!

828
02:07:56,450 --> 02:07:57,260
Kei-chan!

829
02:07:58,260 --> 02:07:59,320
Kei-chan!

830
02:08:03,330 --> 02:08:06,180
Kei-chan!

831
02:09:50,200 --> 02:09:51,560
Thank you very much.

832
02:09:57,980 --> 02:09:58,830
Wanna buy something?

833
02:09:59,440 --> 02:10:01,770
- Yeah, buy me a map.
- Okay.

834
02:10:03,260 --> 02:10:04,230
- I'll take them.
- Oh, thanks.

835
02:10:06,070 --> 02:10:07,030
Map, huh?

836
02:10:07,190 --> 02:10:08,300
Welcome.

837
02:10:08,490 --> 02:10:09,350
Welcome.

838
02:10:30,520 --> 02:10:34,240
"Ayukawa Eriko-san returned to
the entertainment industry"

839
02:10:34,390 --> 02:10:38,430
It's confirmed that all of the members
present in your list are existent.

840
02:10:39,520 --> 02:10:40,920
Please take some time off for yourself.

841
02:10:41,950 --> 02:10:43,230
We will handle the investigation.

842
02:10:45,210 --> 02:10:46,100
I saw them.

843
02:10:47,890 --> 02:10:49,190
I saw those guys with my own eyes.

844
02:10:49,980 --> 02:10:50,830
That room too.

845
02:10:53,020 --> 02:10:54,070
I was just so close.

846
02:11:49,450 --> 02:11:51,070
I'm made breakfast,
so you will do the cleaning.

847
02:12:01,420 --> 02:12:04,610
Okay, hurry up.
Quickly put the mattress away.

848
02:12:10,850 --> 02:12:11,990
Huh?

849
02:12:14,900 --> 02:12:19,200
Well, just that... it feels as if
I haven't seen you for a long time.

850
02:12:21,560 --> 02:12:22,160
You're so strange.

851
02:12:25,270 --> 02:12:29,520
I have... always wanted to do this.

852
02:12:36,850 --> 02:12:37,430
I...

853
02:12:41,070 --> 02:12:42,520
...won't go anywhere anymore.

854
02:12:47,970 --> 02:12:50,590
I know that already, so go to work.

855
02:13:22,930 --> 02:13:26,190
Who... gave me this again?

856
02:13:37,630 --> 02:13:40,850
"Draw the Ferris wheel here"

857
02:13:48,130 --> 02:13:51,560
"To Tae-chan"

858
02:13:58,580 --> 02:14:03,400
"I love you. Kurono Kei"

859
02:14:05,330 --> 02:14:07,950
Kurono... Kei?

860
02:16:06,500 --> 02:16:10,880
[Everyone, please be happy]
