00:00:27,819 --> 00:00:30,820
Please. Please, I'm sorry.

3
00:00:30,822 --> 00:00:32,789
Please!

4
00:00:32,791 --> 00:00:34,490
I don't wanna go in.

5
00:00:34,492 --> 00:00:36,759
Please don't make me go in.

6
00:00:36,761 --> 00:00:38,297
Please.

7
00:00:40,831 --> 00:00:42,000
Please.

8
00:00:42,566 --> 00:00:43,799
Please.

9
00:00:43,801 --> 00:00:44,866
Please.

<i>"A doorway
leading to another world.</i>

00:02:07,718 --> 00:02:10,085
<i>A place where nature behaves

- No, oasis.

14
00:02:13,757 --> 00:02:15,424
Thank you. You know,
your sister's handwriting

15
00:02:15,426 --> 00:02:17,025
just sucks, probably why
she tore out all these pages,

16
00:02:17,027 --> 00:02:18,660
she couldn't read it herself.

17
00:02:21,499 --> 00:02:22,864
Uh, drive's taking
a little longer

18
00:02:22,866 --> 00:02:23,866
than we thought, huh?

19
00:02:23,868 --> 00:02:26,835
We should probably leave
early Sunday morning.

20
00:02:26,837 --> 00:02:29,108
Sunday? I mean, is that even
gonna be enough time?

21
00:02:30,007 --> 00:02:31,141
It's five days.

22
00:02:31,143 --> 00:02:32,845
I mean, how long did you plan
on staying out there?

23
00:02:33,845 --> 00:02:34,944
I don't know. I mean...

24
00:02:34,946 --> 00:02:36,779
But Marylyn is obviously
my priority.

25
00:02:36,781 --> 00:02:38,547
So, what if we don't find her?

26
00:02:38,549 --> 00:02:39,849
Jesus, we will.

27
00:02:39,851 --> 00:02:41,551
Okay? But I have
to be back to work

28
00:02:41,553 --> 00:02:43,785
- by Monday morning.
- Yeah. Me, too.

29
00:02:43,787 --> 00:02:45,654
Yeah, that Days Inn
is really understaffed

30
00:02:45,656 --> 00:02:46,956
this time of year, huh, Gerrik?

31
00:02:48,025 --> 00:02:50,091
Fuck off. It's just temporary.

32
00:02:50,093 --> 00:02:52,128
They'd ship me away if I didn't
fulfill my work visa.

33
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:54,699
Oh, you are the cutest bellboy.

34
00:02:55,532 --> 00:02:57,132
Kenz, don't worry.

35
00:02:57,134 --> 00:02:58,567
Five days is plenty of time.

36
00:02:58,569 --> 00:02:59,905
We'll find her long before then.

37
00:03:00,871 --> 00:03:01,973
Okay.

38
00:03:05,776 --> 00:03:07,542
How do we know Marylyn
is in trouble,

39
00:03:07,544 --> 00:03:09,545
and not just being Marylyn

40
00:03:09,547 --> 00:03:12,682
and, you know, kicking it out
some hippie commune

41
00:03:12,684 --> 00:03:13,982
or something?

42
00:03:13,984 --> 00:03:15,851
Yeah, I wouldn't put it
past Marylyn.

43
00:03:15,853 --> 00:03:18,688
Okay, well, you guys
don't really understand.

44
00:03:18,690 --> 00:03:21,256
'Cause even if she was
in a hippie commune,

45
00:03:21,258 --> 00:03:22,924
Marylyn would let me know.

46
00:03:22,926 --> 00:03:24,493
I mean, Jesus,
when she went camping

47
00:03:24,495 --> 00:03:26,595
in that glacier last summer,
at Logan's Pass,

48
00:03:26,597 --> 00:03:28,096
she still wrote to me.

49
00:03:28,098 --> 00:03:30,533
And she was
in a fucking glacier.

50
00:03:30,535 --> 00:03:32,767
She wrote to you
from Logan's Pass?

51
00:03:32,769 --> 00:03:33,935
Yeah.

52
00:03:33,937 --> 00:03:35,771
Several times.

53
00:03:35,773 --> 00:03:37,106
Which is more
than I even hear from you.

54
00:03:37,108 --> 00:03:38,773
And you guys
live down the street.

55
00:03:38,775 --> 00:03:42,612
Okay, that's enough of that.

56
00:03:42,614 --> 00:03:47,617
Uh, I definitely didn't expect
the car ride to be so long.

57
00:03:47,619 --> 00:03:49,652
The sun's supposed
to set tonight at 8:45,

58
00:03:49,654 --> 00:03:51,220
so as long as we get there
before then,

59
00:03:51,222 --> 00:03:53,122
and set up our tents,
we'll be fine.

60
00:03:53,124 --> 00:03:54,724
Jesus, we better get there
before then.

61
00:03:54,726 --> 00:03:56,725
I am dying of boredom.

62
00:03:56,727 --> 00:03:57,959
Oh, my god, Gerrik,

63
00:03:57,961 --> 00:03:59,695
you knew how long
this was going to be.

64
00:03:59,697 --> 00:04:01,530
Why did you even come?

65
00:04:01,532 --> 00:04:03,231
Because McKenzie invited me.

66
00:04:03,233 --> 00:04:05,567
No, no, no, I didn't.

67
00:04:05,569 --> 00:04:06,636
I asked Martin to come

68
00:04:06,638 --> 00:04:08,637
and he insisted
that you guys go.

69
00:04:08,639 --> 00:04:10,074
Well, the more the merrier,
right?

70
00:04:11,709 --> 00:04:14,076
But seriously,
how long do we have left?

71
00:04:14,078 --> 00:04:15,311
At least another three hours.

72
00:04:16,813 --> 00:04:18,146
Okay, shut up.

73
00:04:18,148 --> 00:04:20,917
I'm the one driving,
so just take a fucking nap.

74
00:04:20,919 --> 00:04:23,585
Well, I was excited
for the car ride.

75
00:04:23,587 --> 00:04:26,888
I really expected it
to be a bit more fun, you know?

76
00:04:26,890 --> 00:04:28,023
Drinking beers.

77
00:04:28,025 --> 00:04:30,326
Stopping off at old gas stations
where some old man works

78
00:04:30,328 --> 00:04:31,727
and is creepy to you girls,

79
00:04:31,729 --> 00:04:33,562
and Edgar would, like,
spit in his face.

80
00:04:33,564 --> 00:04:35,665
And he would follow us because
he'd know where we're going.

81
00:04:35,667 --> 00:04:36,766
Oh, my god, Gerrik.

82
00:04:36,768 --> 00:04:38,568
Do you hear yourself talk?

83
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:40,569
And just so you know,
we are having fun, okay?

84
00:04:40,571 --> 00:04:42,304
Think about it this way,
we're going on a manhunt.

85
00:04:42,306 --> 00:04:44,674
I've never been on a manhunt,
so I'm really excited,

86
00:04:44,676 --> 00:04:45,878
because we are going
on a manhunt.

87
00:04:46,344 --> 00:04:47,876
Me, neither.

88
00:04:47,878 --> 00:04:49,978
It's like, uh,
the most dangerous game.

89
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:51,114
- Mm.
- You know?

90
00:04:51,116 --> 00:04:53,148
Except for the fact that
we are trying to find Marylyn,

91
00:04:53,150 --> 00:04:54,249
and not kill her.

92
00:04:54,251 --> 00:04:56,651
Yeah, that's a big
difference there.

93
00:04:56,653 --> 00:04:59,689
Hey, do we know anything else
about this guy

94
00:04:59,691 --> 00:05:01,723
that we're supposed
to be meeting?

95
00:05:01,725 --> 00:05:03,792
Besides the fact
that this asshole

96
00:05:03,794 --> 00:05:06,227
is trying to ask for money
before he tells us what he knows

97
00:05:06,229 --> 00:05:07,929
about our missing sister?

98
00:05:07,931 --> 00:05:09,831
Yeah, fuck that guy.

99
00:05:09,833 --> 00:05:12,367
Okay, he's not asking for money.

100
00:05:12,369 --> 00:05:15,136
Well, then,
what is he asking for?

101
00:05:16,907 --> 00:05:18,307
I mean, I guess
we're gonna find out.

102
00:05:18,309 --> 00:05:21,212
He's the only one that responded
to the post. So...

103
00:05:22,379 --> 00:05:24,179
"Looking for sister,
Marylyn Cody,

104
00:05:24,181 --> 00:05:25,715
last seen headed
for Cinder Park,

105
00:05:25,717 --> 00:05:27,152
any information, please call."

106
00:05:28,152 --> 00:05:30,720
You posted this on Craigslist?

107
00:05:30,722 --> 00:05:32,088
Without any sexual
favors attached,

108
00:05:32,090 --> 00:05:34,323
and somebody actually responded?

109
00:05:34,325 --> 00:05:37,259
Yeah, I mean people always
respond to stuff on Craigslist

110
00:05:37,261 --> 00:05:38,393
if they know something.

111
00:05:38,395 --> 00:05:40,095
It's true.
It's how that guy in Germany

112
00:05:40,097 --> 00:05:41,797
found someone who would
let him eat him.

113
00:05:41,799 --> 00:05:44,400
Oh, god.
I forgot about that guy.

114
00:05:44,402 --> 00:05:46,167
Mm-mm. Armin Meiwes.

115
00:05:46,169 --> 00:05:47,335
His friends were probably like,

116
00:05:47,337 --> 00:05:48,937
"No one's gonna respond
to that."

117
00:05:48,939 --> 00:05:50,239
Well, he probably didn't have
any friends.

118
00:05:50,241 --> 00:05:51,374
But he did have faith.

119
00:05:51,376 --> 00:05:54,175
And so he posted
his cannibal ad on Craigslist.

120
00:05:54,177 --> 00:05:56,646
And then a week later,
he met that Danish guy...

121
00:05:56,648 --> 00:05:58,913
- Yep.
- he let him eat him.

122
00:05:58,915 --> 00:06:00,217
Sometimes you have
to have a little bit of hope.

123
00:06:01,686 --> 00:06:04,720
- Is that real?
- Real as shit, look it up.

124
00:06:04,722 --> 00:06:07,125
Oh, my god.
People are so fucked up.

125
00:06:08,426 --> 00:06:10,326
I gotta pee.

126
00:06:10,328 --> 00:06:11,863
- Seconded.
- And third.

127
00:06:12,729 --> 00:06:13,896
Fuck it.

128
00:06:13,898 --> 00:06:15,364
Anyone else want one?

129
00:06:15,366 --> 00:06:17,198
Oh, my god. Yes.
Thank you.

130
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:19,001
Uh, uh, uh!

131
00:06:19,003 --> 00:06:21,771
Are bipolar people
allowed to drink?

132
00:06:21,773 --> 00:06:23,304
Come on, man.

133
00:06:23,306 --> 00:06:25,807
Yes, I can have a beer,
you dick.

134
00:06:26,744 --> 00:06:28,343
Just don't feed me
after midnight, though.

135
00:06:28,345 --> 00:06:30,011
That's the one thing.

136
00:06:30,013 --> 00:06:32,213
- I'm sorry, man.
- That's fine.

137
00:06:32,215 --> 00:06:33,016
It's just...

138
00:06:34,451 --> 00:06:37,352
you know, with the hospital stay
and all.

139
00:06:37,354 --> 00:06:41,756
Okay, guys, I'm fine.

140
00:06:41,758 --> 00:06:43,092
All right? The manic episode,

141
00:06:43,094 --> 00:06:45,360
as the doctors are calling it,
was due to stress.

142
00:06:45,362 --> 00:06:47,162
So all I have to do
is just take...

143
00:06:47,164 --> 00:06:50,035
Just take the shit they gave me
and take it easy.

144
00:06:51,469 --> 00:06:54,335
And honestly, this is like
the best thing for me.

145
00:06:54,337 --> 00:06:56,708
It's been way too long
since I've been camping.

146
00:06:58,075 --> 00:07:00,775
I, mean, shit I need this.

147
00:07:00,777 --> 00:07:02,381
Edgar's the best person
to have out here.

148
00:07:03,715 --> 00:07:04,614
It wasn't that long ago,

149
00:07:04,616 --> 00:07:06,418
he was guiding raft trips
in Colorado.

150
00:07:09,287 --> 00:07:11,920
Marylyn would always talk
about the shit you did.

151
00:07:11,922 --> 00:07:13,021
Said it was really dangerous.

152
00:07:13,023 --> 00:07:16,258
So, by her standard,
it must mean it was impressive.

153
00:07:17,261 --> 00:07:19,227
Marylyn
really said that about Edgar?

154
00:07:19,229 --> 00:07:20,732
Yes. She did.

155
00:07:21,833 --> 00:07:23,299
Fuck, man.

156
00:07:23,301 --> 00:07:25,134
- I'm impressed.
- Eh.

157
00:07:25,136 --> 00:07:27,371
Your older sister is one fine...

158
00:07:28,338 --> 00:07:29,771
independent woman.

159
00:07:29,773 --> 00:07:31,008
She must be found.

160
00:07:33,410 --> 00:07:35,845
- On that note, shall we?
- Yes.

161
00:07:39,249 --> 00:07:40,451
Come on, McKenzie.

162
00:07:58,436 --> 00:08:00,035
<i>Okay.</i>

163
00:08:00,037 --> 00:08:02,170
We must be close.

164
00:08:02,172 --> 00:08:05,176
Actually, I think we're here.

165
00:08:08,212 --> 00:08:09,377
Oh, shit.

166
00:08:09,379 --> 00:08:10,915
That place looks fucked.

167
00:08:12,482 --> 00:08:15,283
Okay, no.

168
00:08:15,285 --> 00:08:16,919
You just know
some old creepy guy

169
00:08:16,921 --> 00:08:19,088
with like half his teeth,
works in there.

170
00:08:19,090 --> 00:08:21,489
Yeah. Some like,
retired serial killer?

171
00:08:21,491 --> 00:08:23,424
Praying for a group of city folk
to travel through

172
00:08:23,426 --> 00:08:25,960
and fall into his web.

173
00:08:25,962 --> 00:08:28,396
You think there are
retired serial killers?

174
00:08:28,398 --> 00:08:29,864
Like the ones
who never get caught

175
00:08:29,866 --> 00:08:30,865
then get too old and give it up?

176
00:08:30,867 --> 00:08:34,336
Yeah. Yeah, just like
living normal lives now.

177
00:08:34,338 --> 00:08:36,505
Guaranteed our landlord
might be one.

178
00:08:36,507 --> 00:08:39,275
All right, who's coming in?

179
00:08:39,277 --> 00:08:41,209
I'm good.

180
00:08:41,211 --> 00:08:43,181
Yeah.
No, I think you guys got this.

181
00:08:47,484 --> 00:08:49,050
Why did we even bring
these pussies?

182
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:51,523
Come on, I gotta pee.

183
00:09:00,598 --> 00:09:01,867
You got this, sis.

184
00:09:04,067 --> 00:09:06,937
Oh, this place
is fucking creepy.

185
00:09:31,561 --> 00:09:34,063
Maybe this guy really is
a retired serial killer.

186
00:09:34,065 --> 00:09:37,135
Ha. Shut the fuck up.
Don't say that.

187
00:09:38,201 --> 00:09:41,437
Cooks his victims into the food.

188
00:09:41,439 --> 00:09:42,671
Gross, Darcy.

189
00:09:42,673 --> 00:09:45,576
I'm just saying. Brace yourself
for something fucking weird.

190
00:09:51,114 --> 00:09:52,615
Hello?

191
00:09:52,617 --> 00:09:54,916
Jesus.

192
00:09:54,918 --> 00:09:56,420
Hi, there.

193
00:09:57,521 --> 00:09:59,188
- Jesus Christ.
- Holy hell.

194
00:09:59,190 --> 00:10:00,421
Holy Hell. You girls,

195
00:10:00,423 --> 00:10:01,957
you scared the living shit
out of me.

196
00:10:01,959 --> 00:10:03,358
Oh, yeah?
We scared the hell out of you?

197
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:05,961
You were the one that just
crept up behind us, and...

198
00:10:05,963 --> 00:10:07,029
- Who does that?
- I said...

199
00:10:07,031 --> 00:10:07,997
I said hello.

200
00:10:07,999 --> 00:10:09,330
Yeah, but can you do it
before you're like,

201
00:10:09,332 --> 00:10:10,598
two feet behind us?

202
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:12,400
I'm so sorry,
I was out in the back

203
00:10:12,402 --> 00:10:13,968
fixing the dishwasher.

204
00:10:13,970 --> 00:10:15,503
Didn't hear you come in
till the bell rang.

205
00:10:15,505 --> 00:10:17,906
Yeah, well the guys
are probably freaking out now.

206
00:10:17,908 --> 00:10:19,241
Tell me about it.

207
00:10:19,243 --> 00:10:20,541
Well, I have to use
the bathroom,

208
00:10:20,543 --> 00:10:23,078
so could you please tell me
where that is?

209
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,579
But I don't want
to leave you here, though.

210
00:10:24,581 --> 00:10:25,948
It's fine.

211
00:10:25,950 --> 00:10:27,482
Are you sure?

212
00:10:27,484 --> 00:10:29,017
Yeah, Darcy it's fine.

213
00:10:29,019 --> 00:10:30,287
The bathroom is out,
on the side.

214
00:10:31,555 --> 00:10:32,621
Thank you.

215
00:10:32,623 --> 00:10:34,025
Sorry for freaking you out.

216
00:10:38,396 --> 00:10:40,996
Hi, I'm looking for a man
named Leonard.

217
00:10:40,998 --> 00:10:42,197
Is he here?

218
00:10:42,199 --> 00:10:44,266
Yeah, that's me. Leon.

219
00:10:44,268 --> 00:10:47,269
Oh, okay. Well, I'm McKenzie.

220
00:10:47,271 --> 00:10:48,940
- We spoke online...
- You're Marylyn's sister.

221
00:10:49,639 --> 00:10:50,939
Yes.

222
00:10:50,941 --> 00:10:52,006
Do you know...

223
00:10:52,008 --> 00:10:53,708
Do you know where she is?

224
00:11:00,417 --> 00:11:02,684
Now these,
these are heart rate monitors.

225
00:11:02,686 --> 00:11:04,453
They go on your wrist,
easy-peasy.

226
00:11:04,455 --> 00:11:08,323
Uh, this cell phone,
it's tweaked to work in there.

227
00:11:08,325 --> 00:11:10,391
Now, I usually get
a deposit for this stuff,

228
00:11:10,393 --> 00:11:11,526
most of it's expensive.

229
00:11:11,528 --> 00:11:12,663
Especially these.

230
00:11:15,499 --> 00:11:17,366
Each of you, you drink
one of these before you go in.

231
00:11:17,368 --> 00:11:18,534
Not after.

232
00:11:18,536 --> 00:11:19,734
Now, it doesn't taste great.

233
00:11:19,736 --> 00:11:21,337
But it keeps them
from talking to you.

234
00:11:21,339 --> 00:11:23,671
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Just slow down.

235
00:11:23,673 --> 00:11:26,742
I don't know
if I need any of this,

236
00:11:26,744 --> 00:11:29,078
whatever this shit is.

237
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:30,482
All I wanna do
is find my sister.

238
00:11:32,082 --> 00:11:34,585
Okay, so I know
that she is in, um...

239
00:11:35,686 --> 00:11:37,285
Cinder Park.

240
00:11:37,287 --> 00:11:39,288
If she is in Cinder...

241
00:11:39,290 --> 00:11:41,022
Cinder Park.

242
00:11:41,024 --> 00:11:43,391
I just don't know whether
she's in the rolling hills,

243
00:11:43,393 --> 00:11:45,626
or the falls,
or if there's another place

244
00:11:45,628 --> 00:11:46,694
that I don't even...

245
00:11:46,696 --> 00:11:47,997
- What the fuck?
- That map's

246
00:11:47,999 --> 00:11:49,064
not going to do you any good.

247
00:11:49,066 --> 00:11:50,100
You're gonna need this.

248
00:11:54,604 --> 00:11:56,137
Okay, but she's in Cinder Park.

249
00:11:56,139 --> 00:11:57,405
That's, that's where we need
to go.

250
00:11:57,407 --> 00:11:58,473
No.

251
00:11:58,475 --> 00:12:00,675
The signs might say Cinder Park,

252
00:12:00,677 --> 00:12:02,013
but that's not where
you're going.

253
00:12:03,614 --> 00:12:06,151
Okay, I'm sorry.
I don't understand.

254
00:12:08,385 --> 00:12:09,386
You don't know?

255
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:12,320
What exactly did your sister
tell you

256
00:12:12,322 --> 00:12:13,725
about what she was looking for
out here?

257
00:12:16,224 --> 00:12:17,261
She didn't tell me shit,
but, um...

258
00:12:21,197 --> 00:12:22,199
...this did.

259
00:12:23,033 --> 00:12:24,168
You stole her journal?

260
00:12:24,667 --> 00:12:25,669
Yeah.

261
00:12:27,138 --> 00:12:29,438
It's a sisters thing.
You wouldn't understand.

262
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:30,709
Yeah. Yeah, sure.

263
00:12:32,442 --> 00:12:34,309
Okay, so she keeps mentioning

264
00:12:34,311 --> 00:12:38,046
this secret passageway
in the forest,

265
00:12:38,048 --> 00:12:40,049
but she never says
where it goes or anything else,

266
00:12:40,051 --> 00:12:41,319
and it really doesn't make
any sense.

267
00:12:42,085 --> 00:12:42,952
Uh...

268
00:12:42,954 --> 00:12:44,752
She also keeps mentioning
this place

269
00:12:44,754 --> 00:12:47,522
which I can't find
on any of the maps.

270
00:12:47,524 --> 00:12:49,593
Um, I think it's called...

271
00:12:50,460 --> 00:12:51,528
The Axiom.

272
00:12:52,763 --> 00:12:54,128
Yeah.

273
00:12:54,130 --> 00:12:57,565
Wow. Your sister's
truly amazing.

274
00:12:57,567 --> 00:12:59,303
How she learned all this,
I'll never know.

275
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:04,241
Well, in these pages...

276
00:13:06,676 --> 00:13:10,679
She talks a lot about
how the forest is dangerous.

277
00:13:10,681 --> 00:13:14,282
And how a lot of people
are known to have disappeared.

278
00:13:14,284 --> 00:13:16,751
It's dangerous if you're stupid.

279
00:13:16,753 --> 00:13:18,252
It's dangerous
if you don't listen to people

280
00:13:18,254 --> 00:13:19,523
who are trying to help you.

281
00:13:20,691 --> 00:13:22,524
Cinder Park.

282
00:13:22,526 --> 00:13:25,093
You follow this path.

283
00:13:25,095 --> 00:13:26,594
The passageway,
the door that your sister

284
00:13:26,596 --> 00:13:27,631
writes about in here.

285
00:13:28,599 --> 00:13:29,600
It's real.

286
00:13:30,367 --> 00:13:31,369
It's right here.

287
00:13:34,205 --> 00:13:38,107
And what's so special about
this passageway, this path?

288
00:13:38,109 --> 00:13:39,109
Where does it go?

289
00:13:40,244 --> 00:13:42,211
I thought you'd never ask.

290
00:13:42,213 --> 00:13:44,813
Please, just promise me
you won't say anything.

291
00:13:44,815 --> 00:13:46,814
I can't believe you told Edgar
and not me.

292
00:13:46,816 --> 00:13:47,782
Oh, my god.

293
00:13:47,784 --> 00:13:49,650
Come on, as her brother
and his best friend,

294
00:13:49,652 --> 00:13:50,718
I need to know these things.

295
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:52,621
You're not his best friend.

296
00:13:52,623 --> 00:13:54,758
We're all best friends, equally.

297
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:57,892
Who the hell's gonna be
your best man?

298
00:13:57,894 --> 00:14:00,161
Just both of you,
shut up, please?

299
00:14:00,163 --> 00:14:01,665
She doesn't want
to tell anybody yet.

300
00:14:02,666 --> 00:14:03,866
Oh, here she comes.

301
00:14:03,868 --> 00:14:05,070
Shut up, shut up.

302
00:14:09,874 --> 00:14:12,406
Classy.
And that's your future wife.

303
00:14:12,408 --> 00:14:14,376
Goddamn right, it is.

304
00:14:14,378 --> 00:14:16,211
McKenzie's still in there?

305
00:14:16,213 --> 00:14:17,445
Yeah, she is.

306
00:14:17,447 --> 00:14:18,646
She's been in there for a while.

307
00:14:18,648 --> 00:14:19,650
You should go check on her.

308
00:14:20,283 --> 00:14:21,583
Can't you?

309
00:14:21,585 --> 00:14:23,385
We talked about this.

310
00:14:23,387 --> 00:14:26,354
Uh-oh, is there some trouble
in the Cody family

311
00:14:26,356 --> 00:14:27,923
we aren't aware of?

312
00:14:27,925 --> 00:14:29,625
- Sibling quarrels?
- No.

313
00:14:29,627 --> 00:14:31,293
No, we're fine.

314
00:14:31,295 --> 00:14:33,795
They're definitely not fine.

315
00:14:33,797 --> 00:14:37,933
I told McKenzie about Darcy
and I moving to Clayton

316
00:14:37,935 --> 00:14:39,267
just before we left.

317
00:14:39,269 --> 00:14:40,769
So...

318
00:14:40,771 --> 00:14:42,838
So, what, it's like 20 miles
out from town?

319
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:44,772
Exactly, but, I mean,
you know McKenzie.

320
00:14:44,774 --> 00:14:48,410
She, she wants the family
to be around like, all the time.

321
00:14:48,412 --> 00:14:50,578
It's like... It's a bit much.

322
00:14:50,580 --> 00:14:51,914
She just loves you.

323
00:14:51,916 --> 00:14:53,551
She wants to be around you.

324
00:14:54,685 --> 00:14:56,318
- It's not nuts.
- Oh, now, we know

325
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:58,587
why you're hunting
so hard for Marylyn.

326
00:14:58,589 --> 00:15:00,358
She's cutting her losses
with you.

327
00:15:01,892 --> 00:15:03,695
I'm perfectly okay with that.

328
00:15:04,662 --> 00:15:06,495
You're her big brother.

329
00:15:06,497 --> 00:15:07,532
That means something.

330
00:15:08,766 --> 00:15:09,767
Huh.

331
00:15:14,205 --> 00:15:17,142
Uh, come on, please? For me?

332
00:15:18,274 --> 00:15:20,375
God.

333
00:15:20,377 --> 00:15:21,309
I'll do really naughty things

334
00:15:21,311 --> 00:15:23,281
- to you later.
- Hey, I'll be right back.

335
00:15:25,816 --> 00:15:27,248
Goddamn it.

336
00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:28,385
Winner.

337
00:15:49,373 --> 00:15:50,608
That's what I thought.

338
00:15:52,942 --> 00:15:54,008
You're a fucking liar.

339
00:15:54,010 --> 00:15:55,810
- I'm not lying.
- It's not possible.

340
00:15:55,812 --> 00:15:57,779
Look, I know it's hard
to take at first.

341
00:15:57,781 --> 00:15:59,747
You've just gotta try
and keep an open mind.

342
00:16:02,619 --> 00:16:05,286
I just don't get why you're
fucking with me right now.

343
00:16:05,288 --> 00:16:06,887
Oh, look, sweetheart,
I don't give a damn

344
00:16:06,889 --> 00:16:07,856
if you don't believe me.

345
00:16:07,858 --> 00:16:10,559
You'll see.
You go there, you'll feel it.

346
00:16:10,561 --> 00:16:11,593
It's warm.

347
00:16:11,595 --> 00:16:13,929
The closer you get,
you can feel it vibrating.

348
00:16:13,931 --> 00:16:15,997
Like there's loud music
coming from the other side.

349
00:16:15,999 --> 00:16:17,933
That's how you'll know
where it is.

350
00:16:17,935 --> 00:16:20,301
So you listen to me.

351
00:16:20,303 --> 00:16:22,871
You take this stuff
and you put it

352
00:16:22,873 --> 00:16:24,676
into your little backpack here.

353
00:16:33,883 --> 00:16:34,885
Hello, there.

354
00:16:36,586 --> 00:16:38,322
- You okay?
- Yeah.

355
00:16:40,891 --> 00:16:42,056
I'm Martin.

356
00:16:42,058 --> 00:16:43,891
Martin. I'm Leon.

357
00:16:43,893 --> 00:16:44,959
Nice to meet you.

358
00:16:44,961 --> 00:16:46,461
You know where our sister is?

359
00:16:46,463 --> 00:16:47,429
I surely do.

360
00:16:47,431 --> 00:16:49,631
I've was just telling
your McKenzie here.

361
00:16:49,633 --> 00:16:51,599
See, you follow the path.
In the center of the forest,

362
00:16:51,601 --> 00:16:53,801
there's a group
of traveler outposts.

363
00:16:53,803 --> 00:16:55,273
She should be
around there somewhere.

364
00:16:57,307 --> 00:16:59,308
Okay. Thanks, man.

365
00:16:59,310 --> 00:17:00,675
If there is anything we can do
for your help...

366
00:17:00,677 --> 00:17:03,444
Why, thank you, Martin.
Actually, there is.

367
00:17:03,446 --> 00:17:05,347
You see,
last time I was at Cinder,

368
00:17:05,349 --> 00:17:07,616
my wife, well,
she lost something.

369
00:17:07,618 --> 00:17:11,520
A necklace that I'd, well,
she'd really like it back, and,

370
00:17:11,522 --> 00:17:13,457
here, you take this.

371
00:17:15,091 --> 00:17:16,892
Pretty, isn't she?

372
00:17:16,894 --> 00:17:18,527
Now, you see that necklace?

373
00:17:18,529 --> 00:17:20,395
Now, that should be around
that traveler's outpost.

374
00:17:20,397 --> 00:17:21,933
You know, lost items
usually end up there.

375
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:26,001
Why haven't you just gone in
and gotten it?

376
00:17:26,003 --> 00:17:27,735
You kidding?
Got a business to run.

377
00:17:27,737 --> 00:17:30,405
As you can see, it's in
a desperate need of attention.

378
00:17:30,407 --> 00:17:32,941
Yeah. Yeah, okay.

379
00:17:32,943 --> 00:17:35,010
Well, we'll keep an eye out
for it.

380
00:17:35,012 --> 00:17:37,979
You know, I would truly
appreciate that.

381
00:17:37,981 --> 00:17:40,048
Oh, the park is technically
closed this time of year,

382
00:17:40,050 --> 00:17:41,515
but I know the ranger.

383
00:17:41,517 --> 00:17:43,719
Yeah, you pop that
on your windshield,

384
00:17:43,721 --> 00:17:44,722
no one will bother you.

385
00:17:46,023 --> 00:17:48,056
Cool. Thanks, man.
I appreciate it.

386
00:17:48,058 --> 00:17:49,761
You know,
I greatly admire Marylyn.

387
00:17:50,994 --> 00:17:52,397
I do hope she's okay.

388
00:17:55,765 --> 00:17:57,467
Hey, you watch out
for that sister, huh?

389
00:18:04,875 --> 00:18:06,344
Good luck.

390
00:18:10,513 --> 00:18:11,616
Is everything okay?

391
00:18:12,616 --> 00:18:13,882
What'd they say?

392
00:18:13,884 --> 00:18:15,787
McKenzie, you all right?

393
00:18:16,919 --> 00:18:18,386
That was weird.

394
00:18:18,388 --> 00:18:20,023
Why would Marylyn
ever go see that guy?

395
00:18:21,625 --> 00:18:22,794
Because the park's closed.

396
00:18:24,727 --> 00:18:26,029
And now we can get in.

397
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:34,735
All right.

398
00:18:34,737 --> 00:18:35,972
Let's go find Marylyn.

399
00:18:49,119 --> 00:18:51,019
Ugh, I just lost service.

400
00:18:51,021 --> 00:18:53,424
Aw, what are your
12 followers gonna do?

401
00:18:55,058 --> 00:18:56,728
Oh, I just lost service, too.

402
00:18:57,628 --> 00:18:59,661
If the park was closed,

403
00:18:59,663 --> 00:19:03,831
why would Marylyn ever go
to this traveler's outpost?

404
00:19:03,833 --> 00:19:05,802
What do you think
she was looking for out there?

405
00:19:06,837 --> 00:19:07,839
I don't know.

406
00:19:11,140 --> 00:19:12,840
Definitely have to camp there.

407
00:19:12,842 --> 00:19:14,876
The sun is going down.

408
00:19:14,878 --> 00:19:17,080
Guys, I'm afraid we are setting
these tents up in the dark.

409
00:19:36,632 --> 00:19:38,802
<i>Gerrik, I'm gonna
fuck you in your tent tonight.</i>

410
00:19:40,971 --> 00:19:42,904
<i>Welcome to Cinder Park.</i>

411
00:19:42,906 --> 00:19:44,205
We're here, baby.

412
00:19:44,207 --> 00:19:46,640
I can't wait to get out
of this fucking car.

413
00:20:06,530 --> 00:20:07,896
- You gotta pee?
- Mm-hm.

414
00:20:07,898 --> 00:20:09,563
Oh, I gotta pee.

415
00:20:09,565 --> 00:20:11,966
We're not gonna
get in trouble for this, are we?

416
00:20:11,968 --> 00:20:14,536
I'm really scared
of the law services out here.

417
00:20:14,538 --> 00:20:15,703
Gerrik, calm down.

418
00:20:15,705 --> 00:20:17,038
You're not that important.

419
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:18,572
Did you know
there's, uh,

420
00:20:18,574 --> 00:20:20,908
there's a new species of frogs
in this area?

421
00:20:20,910 --> 00:20:22,610
- Frog?
- Yeah.

422
00:20:48,170 --> 00:20:49,974
"Cinder Creek
Traveler's Outpost."

423
00:20:50,807 --> 00:20:51,809
To the right.

424
00:21:12,161 --> 00:21:13,563
What the fuck
is she doing?

425
00:21:16,032 --> 00:21:17,635
McKenzie, the trail
is right here.

426
00:21:19,703 --> 00:21:21,539
Kenz, what's up?

427
00:21:28,946 --> 00:21:29,946
Hey, Gerrik.

428
00:21:30,914 --> 00:21:31,916
Come here.

429
00:21:35,886 --> 00:21:37,555
- You wanna help me?
- Yeah.

430
00:21:39,156 --> 00:21:40,691
Okay, come here.

431
00:21:41,891 --> 00:21:45,696
I need you to walk
in that direction...

432
00:21:46,696 --> 00:21:47,798
for 20 feet.

433
00:21:48,698 --> 00:21:49,734
Can you do that?

434
00:21:50,634 --> 00:21:51,899
Yeah, but why can't we...

435
00:21:51,901 --> 00:21:54,205
- Can you?
- Yeah, obviously.

436
00:21:54,937 --> 00:21:56,040
Okay.

437
00:21:56,907 --> 00:21:58,239
Go.

438
00:22:07,618 --> 00:22:08,919
All right, McKenzie.

439
00:22:09,753 --> 00:22:11,155
I'm walking.

440
00:22:11,821 --> 00:22:13,023
I'm walking.

441
00:22:14,291 --> 00:22:15,659
Is this far enough?

442
00:22:26,369 --> 00:22:28,069
Good one, guys.

443
00:22:28,071 --> 00:22:30,338
The old leave
while my back's turned trick.

444
00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:32,109
You guys are hilarious.

445
00:23:05,841 --> 00:23:07,809
Are you really that high, still?

446
00:23:07,811 --> 00:23:09,344
Dude, such a fucker.

447
00:23:09,346 --> 00:23:10,648
Goober.

448
00:23:11,947 --> 00:23:13,383
All right, let's go.

449
00:23:22,059 --> 00:23:24,192
I definitely think
he's had sex with a girl before,

450
00:23:24,194 --> 00:23:25,694
it's just been
a really long time.

451
00:23:25,696 --> 00:23:26,731
- Gerrik?
- Yeah.

452
00:23:27,263 --> 00:23:28,264
There's no way.

453
00:23:29,465 --> 00:23:31,002
What the fuck?

454
00:23:33,169 --> 00:23:36,407
It's too warm out,
I'm not walking another step.

455
00:23:38,274 --> 00:23:39,342
I think
they're stopping.

456
00:23:42,745 --> 00:23:44,378
- Come on, man.
- No, fuck you, Martin.

457
00:23:44,380 --> 00:23:48,148
You never said this had
so much hiking involved.

458
00:23:48,150 --> 00:23:49,850
Come on man, let's just
set him down for a minute.

459
00:23:49,852 --> 00:23:51,720
Have you got any more weed left?

460
00:23:51,722 --> 00:23:54,422
Uh-uh. No, we'll play
a little game.

461
00:23:54,424 --> 00:23:57,762
It's called you get to the tent
and we can smoke this joint.

462
00:23:58,328 --> 00:23:59,864
Fucking wanker.

463
00:24:07,771 --> 00:24:12,272
So, I just had a great idea on
how I can just get my green card

464
00:24:12,274 --> 00:24:14,778
and my days at Days Inn will be
a thing of the past.

465
00:24:17,848 --> 00:24:19,347
Oh, my god. Really?

466
00:24:19,349 --> 00:24:20,415
What?

467
00:24:20,417 --> 00:24:23,050
You saw the way she was touching
my arm back there.

468
00:24:23,052 --> 00:24:24,752
Uh-huh.

469
00:24:24,754 --> 00:24:26,090
Come on, man. What do you say?

470
00:24:27,858 --> 00:24:28,923
Dual wedding?

471
00:24:28,925 --> 00:24:30,325
We'll be each other's best man.

472
00:24:30,327 --> 00:24:32,359
I'm gonna pretend
like I didn't hear this.

473
00:24:32,361 --> 00:24:34,064
We don't have
all day, come on.

474
00:24:35,398 --> 00:24:37,234
You gonna let
a bunch of girls beat you?

475
00:24:38,234 --> 00:24:39,369
I'll beat you up the mountain.

476
00:24:40,936 --> 00:24:42,803
All right, go on.

477
00:24:42,805 --> 00:24:44,841
Just saying, this is why
you're not getting laid.

478
00:24:46,376 --> 00:24:47,378
Whoa.

479
00:24:48,177 --> 00:24:49,179
Harsh.

480
00:24:50,446 --> 00:24:51,982
I'm sweating.

481
00:24:53,949 --> 00:24:55,753
And the sun's still out.
How is that possible?

482
00:24:56,953 --> 00:24:58,552
It's almost nine.

483
00:24:58,554 --> 00:25:01,091
Sun might set a little later
this far north.

484
00:25:02,324 --> 00:25:03,326
Still...

485
00:25:04,127 --> 00:25:05,763
it's really bright out.

486
00:25:07,464 --> 00:25:10,231
Uh, so...

487
00:25:10,233 --> 00:25:12,168
Darcy and McKenzie.
Do they ever hang out?

488
00:25:13,102 --> 00:25:14,434
No, not really.

489
00:25:14,436 --> 00:25:16,870
Darcy's got her friends
from work.

490
00:25:16,872 --> 00:25:20,207
And McKenzie, she's got...

491
00:25:20,209 --> 00:25:21,811
You.

492
00:25:22,946 --> 00:25:24,281
Does McKenzie have a boyfriend?

493
00:25:26,015 --> 00:25:29,349
I don't think so. I don't know.

494
00:25:29,351 --> 00:25:32,921
Dude, you don't know if your
own sister has a boyfriend?

495
00:25:32,923 --> 00:25:34,992
Don't worry, we can fix that.

496
00:25:40,062 --> 00:25:42,129
She is definitely
more high strung than usual,

497
00:25:42,131 --> 00:25:43,565
and, honestly...

498
00:25:43,567 --> 00:25:44,902
...I'm into it.

499
00:25:48,304 --> 00:25:49,904
I love your sister, man.

500
00:25:49,906 --> 00:25:51,472
I love her shorts.

501
00:25:51,474 --> 00:25:53,878
She's clearly wanting
a bit of British penis.

502
00:25:54,578 --> 00:25:55,812
Come on!

503
00:26:01,551 --> 00:26:02,552
Guys.

504
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:06,157
Edgar?

505
00:26:08,524 --> 00:26:09,826
What's going on, man?

506
00:26:10,526 --> 00:26:11,561
You don't see her?

507
00:26:14,330 --> 00:26:15,432
See who?

508
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:18,569
The girl she's...
she's right here.

509
00:26:20,936 --> 00:26:22,339
You're freaking G out, man.

510
00:26:24,107 --> 00:26:25,373
You okay, man?

511
00:26:30,146 --> 00:26:31,315
You all right, man?

512
00:26:39,923 --> 00:26:41,090
Yeah, I'm fine.

513
00:26:53,136 --> 00:26:54,205
What did you say?

514
00:26:55,671 --> 00:26:57,271
I didn't say anything.

515
00:26:57,273 --> 00:26:59,574
What the fuck did you say?

516
00:26:59,576 --> 00:27:01,545
Are you sure
you should take that many?

517
00:27:03,079 --> 00:27:05,312
Yeah, I'm fine.

518
00:27:05,314 --> 00:27:06,316
I'm okay.

519
00:27:08,984 --> 00:27:11,222
Guys, I'm fine.

520
00:27:12,522 --> 00:27:14,187
All right, man.

521
00:27:14,189 --> 00:27:15,458
I'm fine. Come on. Let's...

522
00:27:16,292 --> 00:27:17,328
Let's just go.

523
00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:33,241
Come on, bitch.

524
00:27:33,243 --> 00:27:34,912
I'm coming.

525
00:27:36,012 --> 00:27:37,147
The sun's still out.

526
00:27:39,215 --> 00:27:42,253
Yeah, it is pretty strange.

527
00:27:44,020 --> 00:27:45,122
It's getting late.

528
00:27:50,994 --> 00:27:53,161
This is nice.

529
00:27:53,163 --> 00:27:56,396
You know, the city can get so...
I don't know.

530
00:27:56,398 --> 00:27:57,531
Rushed.

531
00:27:57,533 --> 00:27:58,601
But this is...

532
00:28:00,203 --> 00:28:01,205
beautiful.

533
00:28:02,504 --> 00:28:04,073
Peaceful, you know?

534
00:28:07,209 --> 00:28:09,245
Clayton's not going
to be much better, you know?

535
00:28:12,215 --> 00:28:13,350
I'm just saying.

536
00:28:14,650 --> 00:28:15,686
Yeah.

537
00:28:17,119 --> 00:28:18,353
Martin said
you were pretty upset

538
00:28:18,355 --> 00:28:19,523
when he told you
we were leaving.

539
00:28:20,590 --> 00:28:24,194
I'm not upset, I just know him.

540
00:28:25,528 --> 00:28:27,064
We won't ever see him around.

541
00:28:28,764 --> 00:28:29,731
It's fine, though.

542
00:28:29,733 --> 00:28:31,331
I mean, once we get Marylyn
back at home,

543
00:28:31,333 --> 00:28:32,535
he can do whatever he wants.

544
00:28:39,376 --> 00:28:41,078
You two moving in together,
though.

545
00:28:42,445 --> 00:28:43,981
Seems pretty serious.

546
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:46,079
Yeah, it is.

547
00:28:46,081 --> 00:28:48,616
Well, which is why
I'd really like it

548
00:28:48,618 --> 00:28:50,018
if you and I
could maybe spend some...

549
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:51,055
Is that it?

550
00:28:53,089 --> 00:28:54,425
Yeah, looks like it.

551
00:28:58,160 --> 00:28:59,196
Looks like we found it.

552
00:29:02,264 --> 00:29:05,369
- Where's Gerrik?
- Um, he's coming.

553
00:29:30,659 --> 00:29:31,728
Marylyn!

554
00:29:35,330 --> 00:29:36,664
Marylyn!

555
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:40,167
You see anybody in there?

556
00:29:40,169 --> 00:29:42,638
Nah, man. This place looks like
it hasn't been used in years.

557
00:29:49,212 --> 00:29:50,677
I don't know,
McKenzie, this is your thing.

558
00:29:50,679 --> 00:29:51,681
What do you want to do?

559
00:29:56,285 --> 00:29:57,417
Well, there's
two other buildings,

560
00:29:57,419 --> 00:29:59,220
one there and one there.

561
00:29:59,222 --> 00:30:00,521
Martin, check one.
Edgar, check the other.

562
00:30:00,523 --> 00:30:01,558
And we'll try to get in here.

563
00:30:09,498 --> 00:30:11,267
Okay, how do we do this?

564
00:30:24,813 --> 00:30:26,115
Marylyn!

565
00:30:38,695 --> 00:30:40,297
I'll check this one down here.

566
00:30:48,303 --> 00:30:49,473
It's locked.

567
00:31:20,802 --> 00:31:22,235
Huh.

568
00:31:22,237 --> 00:31:23,171
Look who made it.

569
00:31:23,173 --> 00:31:26,273
That is the last time
I'm going anywhere

570
00:31:26,275 --> 00:31:29,510
with you or your sister.

571
00:31:29,512 --> 00:31:31,578
How's that cigarette
treating you at this altitude?

572
00:31:31,580 --> 00:31:33,813
It's delicious.

573
00:31:33,815 --> 00:31:35,852
Come on, let's go see
if the girls found anything.

574
00:31:37,821 --> 00:31:40,221
Have you guys noticed
that the sun is not going down?

575
00:31:40,223 --> 00:31:42,459
It's just kind of moving around?

576
00:31:55,905 --> 00:31:57,441
Everything's locked up tight.

577
00:31:57,940 --> 00:31:58,741
Now what?

578
00:32:00,475 --> 00:32:01,742
You know what?
We should look around

579
00:32:01,744 --> 00:32:03,243
while it's still light out.

580
00:32:03,245 --> 00:32:04,311
Search for clues.

581
00:32:04,313 --> 00:32:05,349
Scooby Doo style.

582
00:32:06,616 --> 00:32:09,617
All right, Daphne.
You go search for clues.

583
00:32:09,619 --> 00:32:10,786
I'm gonna set up my tent.

584
00:32:15,524 --> 00:32:17,692
All right, I'll check
the surrounding area.

585
00:32:17,694 --> 00:32:20,397
You know, maybe Marylyn
set up her camp somewhere.

586
00:32:27,669 --> 00:32:28,906
Wait somebody's stuff
is in here.

587
00:32:29,638 --> 00:32:30,706
You know what,

588
00:32:32,308 --> 00:32:33,808
I got some eyeglass tools
in my pack,

589
00:32:33,810 --> 00:32:35,675
that we could use
to get the lock open.

590
00:32:35,677 --> 00:32:37,877
Or maybe there's like,
a side window

591
00:32:37,879 --> 00:32:40,484
or something that has a screen
we can pop out.

592
00:32:42,284 --> 00:32:43,751
Maybe we should try a back door?

593
00:32:43,753 --> 00:32:45,418
I feel like this place
have a back door, right?

594
00:32:45,420 --> 00:32:47,655
Fuck, Kenz!

595
00:32:47,657 --> 00:32:49,757
Oh, my god!

596
00:32:49,759 --> 00:32:51,962
I am so attracted
to you right now.

597
00:33:08,677 --> 00:33:10,379
Martin's totally gonna want
to see this.

598
00:33:17,587 --> 00:33:21,321
Damn it! It's empty.

599
00:33:21,323 --> 00:33:23,726
I mean, but it could be
her's, though, I don't know.

600
00:33:25,427 --> 00:33:26,429
Look at this.

601
00:33:27,296 --> 00:33:29,562
What is it?

602
00:33:29,564 --> 00:33:31,831
It's a ledger for
everybody who's ever been here.

603
00:33:31,833 --> 00:33:33,634
A clue.

604
00:33:33,636 --> 00:33:35,772
Okay, well, do you see
Marylyn's name?

605
00:33:37,407 --> 00:33:38,407
Marylyn!

606
00:33:40,776 --> 00:33:41,811
Marylyn?

607
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:46,681
All right, if you don't come out
in the next minute,

608
00:33:46,683 --> 00:33:48,348
I'm gonna be forced
to tell McKenzie

609
00:33:48,350 --> 00:33:51,287
about the time you had sex
with Aaron Dorsey on her bed.

610
00:33:53,423 --> 00:33:55,690
Yeah, you're not out here,
are you?

611
00:33:55,692 --> 00:33:57,928
I'm the only one out here,
talking to myself.

612
00:34:03,332 --> 00:34:04,964
Yeah, this is great.

613
00:34:07,536 --> 00:34:08,668
- Boo!
- Jesus!

614
00:34:10,339 --> 00:34:11,404
Where is everybody?

615
00:34:11,406 --> 00:34:12,706
Oh! We got into the outpost.

616
00:34:12,708 --> 00:34:13,842
You should have seen McKenzie,

617
00:34:13,844 --> 00:34:16,444
she broke down the door,
she's like, like Jack Nicholson

618
00:34:16,446 --> 00:34:18,045
when he swings that axe
in <i>The Shining.</i>

619
00:34:18,047 --> 00:34:20,681
Caretaker's chest. Aah!

620
00:34:20,683 --> 00:34:22,049
Oh, it was so badass.

621
00:34:22,051 --> 00:34:24,518
You are a dork.

622
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:26,520
- Yeah, and?
- Come on we should head back.

623
00:34:26,522 --> 00:34:28,723
No, I think that Scooby Doo
and the rest of the gang

624
00:34:28,725 --> 00:34:30,991
will be okay without Fred
and Daphne for a while.

625
00:34:30,993 --> 00:34:32,726
Oh, we're Fred and Daphne now?

626
00:34:32,728 --> 00:34:35,128
Duh! Daphne was fucking hot.

627
00:34:35,130 --> 00:34:38,666
Goddamn, she was.

628
00:34:38,668 --> 00:34:41,034
But Fred, he was...
he was kind of a tool, though?

629
00:34:41,036 --> 00:34:42,837
No, he wasn't.
He had that cute ascot.

630
00:34:42,839 --> 00:34:43,904
Uh-huh.

631
00:34:43,906 --> 00:34:44,975
Come on, we should head back.

632
00:34:46,042 --> 00:34:49,543
I mean, we could keep looking

633
00:34:49,545 --> 00:34:51,514
out here
for a little lot longer.

634
00:34:54,150 --> 00:34:55,916
Yeah. Yeah, maybe.

635
00:34:57,719 --> 00:34:59,987
Maybe we should keep searching.

636
00:34:59,989 --> 00:35:04,425
I mean, there's so much ground
to cover.

637
00:35:04,427 --> 00:35:05,429
Mm.

638
00:35:10,433 --> 00:35:12,733
Jesus. There's a lot
of people here.

639
00:35:12,735 --> 00:35:14,471
Check to see who was the last
to sign it.

640
00:35:16,572 --> 00:35:18,538
Gregory and Allison Scott.

641
00:35:18,540 --> 00:35:19,842
1957.

642
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:25,581
This place is weird.

643
00:35:27,884 --> 00:35:29,886
I mean this box,
all these papers.

644
00:35:30,953 --> 00:35:33,556
Everything's dated back to 1957.

645
00:35:35,190 --> 00:35:36,459
These photos.

646
00:35:48,203 --> 00:35:49,538
Where did you get that?

647
00:35:52,607 --> 00:35:54,442
The guy from the restaurant
gave it to me.

648
00:35:54,444 --> 00:35:56,413
He said his wife lost
a necklace here or something.

649
00:36:02,217 --> 00:36:03,453
What?

650
00:36:05,688 --> 00:36:06,757
I saw her.

651
00:36:18,100 --> 00:36:19,636
I love you, baby.

652
00:36:43,625 --> 00:36:45,161
God,
you are so beautiful.

653
00:36:56,973 --> 00:36:58,572
What's wrong? What's wrong?

654
00:36:59,641 --> 00:37:00,643
What's wrong?

655
00:37:01,511 --> 00:37:02,612
Nothing.

656
00:37:05,214 --> 00:37:06,215
I'm okay.

657
00:37:11,821 --> 00:37:13,119
You know,
we've been gone a long time.

658
00:37:13,121 --> 00:37:14,123
We should get back.

659
00:37:18,594 --> 00:37:20,159
What do you mean you think
you saw her?

660
00:37:20,161 --> 00:37:21,531
I saw...

661
00:37:27,536 --> 00:37:28,938
I don't know what I saw.
Never mind.

662
00:37:30,605 --> 00:37:31,640
Nothing.

663
00:37:49,692 --> 00:37:50,791
Hey, Edgar?

664
00:37:50,793 --> 00:37:51,795
Mm-hm.

665
00:37:53,929 --> 00:37:56,195
Do you still have your tools?

666
00:37:56,197 --> 00:37:58,601
Because I want to open
that box over there.

667
00:38:00,069 --> 00:38:01,071
Yeah.

668
00:38:02,003 --> 00:38:03,570
Look, I'm just very aware

669
00:38:03,572 --> 00:38:05,905
of all the breaking and entering
that we're doing.

670
00:38:05,907 --> 00:38:07,574
I mean, somebody owns
this place.

671
00:38:07,576 --> 00:38:10,610
Yeah, and that somebody
will understand.

672
00:38:10,612 --> 00:38:12,114
Or do I have to go get
the axe again?

673
00:38:17,219 --> 00:38:18,184
In case you're wondering,

674
00:38:18,186 --> 00:38:20,924
the sun is still out,
and it's almost 11.

675
00:39:01,263 --> 00:39:03,063
- Hey.
- Hey.

676
00:39:03,065 --> 00:39:04,833
Did you guys find anything?

677
00:39:05,735 --> 00:39:06,800
No.

678
00:39:06,802 --> 00:39:08,302
Were you even looking?

679
00:39:08,304 --> 00:39:10,137
Yes, dick.

680
00:39:10,139 --> 00:39:12,338
We were doing something,

681
00:39:12,340 --> 00:39:13,944
other than
just fucking sitting there.

682
00:39:17,145 --> 00:39:18,645
Cut off their heads.

683
00:39:18,647 --> 00:39:20,380
I told them
to cut off their heads.

684
00:39:20,382 --> 00:39:21,849
But they didn't listen.

685
00:39:21,851 --> 00:39:23,183
And now, look what happened!

686
00:39:24,719 --> 00:39:26,355
Is anyone worried about the sun?

687
00:39:28,991 --> 00:39:30,324
It's almost midnight.

688
00:39:30,326 --> 00:39:32,425
What the fuck is going on?

689
00:39:32,427 --> 00:39:33,694
Where's McKenzie?

690
00:39:33,696 --> 00:39:36,029
She's, uh,
up there in the outpost.

691
00:39:55,384 --> 00:39:56,449
What happened?

692
00:39:56,451 --> 00:39:58,020
- Huh?
- You okay?

693
00:40:00,755 --> 00:40:02,121
Sorry.

694
00:40:02,123 --> 00:40:04,123
I thought I saw a rat
or something.

695
00:40:04,125 --> 00:40:05,192
Okay.

696
00:40:05,194 --> 00:40:06,126
I don't get it.

697
00:40:06,128 --> 00:40:07,860
Why did Marylyn would
ever come in here?

698
00:40:07,862 --> 00:40:08,964
I mean, look at this place.

699
00:40:11,366 --> 00:40:13,936
Well, she might, if there was
a storm or something.

700
00:40:16,105 --> 00:40:17,170
I guess.

701
00:40:17,172 --> 00:40:18,471
Edgar, did you bring your tools,

702
00:40:18,473 --> 00:40:20,340
'cause I really want
to open this box.

703
00:40:20,342 --> 00:40:22,076
Why?

704
00:40:22,078 --> 00:40:23,710
Because, Gerrik,
it's the last place

705
00:40:23,712 --> 00:40:25,179
I haven't checked
and I want to look.

706
00:40:25,181 --> 00:40:27,447
All right, Lizzy Borden,
want to open up another one?

707
00:40:27,449 --> 00:40:28,715
No.

708
00:40:28,717 --> 00:40:30,150
No, it's just a simple lock.

709
00:40:30,152 --> 00:40:32,322
Here. Look, we don't need
to tear anything up.

710
00:40:35,891 --> 00:40:36,893
Grab that one.

711
00:40:38,293 --> 00:40:39,362
No, the other one.

712
00:40:42,364 --> 00:40:43,400
All right.

713
00:40:47,069 --> 00:40:48,170
- What?
- Uh...

714
00:40:48,871 --> 00:40:50,404
It just, uh...

715
00:40:50,406 --> 00:40:51,838
It reminds me
of that one Christmas

716
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:53,440
when we were kids.

717
00:40:53,442 --> 00:40:55,241
When we broke into Mom
and Dad's closet

718
00:40:55,243 --> 00:40:56,976
and saw all
our Christmas presents?

719
00:40:56,978 --> 00:40:59,980
Yeah, fuck.

720
00:40:59,982 --> 00:41:02,116
It's less gratifying
when find all your presents

721
00:41:02,118 --> 00:41:04,050
unwrapped like that at once.

722
00:41:04,052 --> 00:41:08,058
Yup, had to fake surprise
the entire next morning.

723
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:12,159
Oh, my god. And we had to act

724
00:41:12,161 --> 00:41:13,897
like we didn't find
Mom's vibrator.

725
00:41:16,431 --> 00:41:17,833
Uh, do you...

726
00:41:18,868 --> 00:41:21,835
All right, um, hold your steady.

727
00:41:21,837 --> 00:41:23,206
There's no way this works.

728
00:41:24,139 --> 00:41:26,172
One...

729
00:41:26,174 --> 00:41:27,776
two, three.

730
00:41:29,478 --> 00:41:31,815
It worked. You did it.

731
00:41:33,516 --> 00:41:36,016
Where the hell
did you learn how to do that?

732
00:41:36,018 --> 00:41:37,518
- That?
- Hm.

733
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:38,788
Wouldn't you like
to know?

734
00:41:57,572 --> 00:41:58,775
Is that...

735
00:41:59,507 --> 00:42:00,773
Yeah.

736
00:42:00,775 --> 00:42:03,011
You guys, when we were at the
restaurant, that guy, Leon...

737
00:42:04,279 --> 00:42:06,079
he showed us this picture
of his wife.

738
00:42:06,081 --> 00:42:07,848
Said he... She's missing
a necklace.

739
00:42:07,850 --> 00:42:08,918
That's the necklace.

740
00:42:10,386 --> 00:42:11,487
You all should see this.

741
00:42:18,326 --> 00:42:19,828
What the fuck?

742
00:42:32,241 --> 00:42:34,340
What is that red line?

743
00:42:34,342 --> 00:42:40,313
Look, I'm no expert,
but that looks a lot like...

744
00:42:40,315 --> 00:42:41,350
Blood?

745
00:42:50,458 --> 00:42:51,960
I'm gonna go get some water.

746
00:42:53,094 --> 00:42:54,129
Are you okay?

747
00:42:56,031 --> 00:42:58,902
Yeah, I'm fine. I'm dehydrated.

748
00:43:00,969 --> 00:43:02,469
Maybe we shouldn't have
brought him on this trip.

749
00:43:02,471 --> 00:43:04,237
This is a little too much.

750
00:43:18,487 --> 00:43:21,188
Yeah, I'll go get him.

751
00:43:21,190 --> 00:43:22,192
We'll build a fire.

752
00:43:23,157 --> 00:43:24,324
Do you have any matches?

753
00:43:24,326 --> 00:43:25,328
Yeah, they're in my bag.

754
00:43:29,632 --> 00:43:31,100
Hey, have you guys, um...

755
00:43:33,002 --> 00:43:34,934
Have you guys seen
anything weird?

756
00:43:34,936 --> 00:43:36,503
Besides this creepy outpost

757
00:43:36,505 --> 00:43:38,404
with a backyard full of chains
and blood, no.

758
00:43:38,406 --> 00:43:39,408
This is all normal.

759
00:44:26,956 --> 00:44:28,224
Martin, what the fuck
are you doing?

760
00:44:31,627 --> 00:44:33,128
He's grabbing
the matches from my....

761
00:44:34,228 --> 00:44:35,297
Fuck.

762
00:44:42,503 --> 00:44:44,471
- What is this?
- What do you mean?

763
00:44:44,473 --> 00:44:47,674
What the fuck is this, McKenzie?

764
00:44:47,676 --> 00:44:50,444
The guy at the restaurant.
He gave you this shit?

765
00:44:50,446 --> 00:44:52,545
It's nothing, Martin.
It's just stupid...

766
00:44:52,547 --> 00:44:53,582
No!

767
00:44:54,583 --> 00:44:57,116
No! Martin!

768
00:44:57,118 --> 00:44:59,018
You don't understand.
We need those!

769
00:44:59,020 --> 00:45:00,587
Martin, what's wrong?

770
00:45:00,589 --> 00:45:02,655
She tore out the pages
to Marylyn's journal.

771
00:45:02,657 --> 00:45:04,991
She didn't want us to see this.

772
00:45:04,993 --> 00:45:07,126
There's something dangerous
in these woods.

773
00:45:07,128 --> 00:45:08,364
Uh, what do you mean?

774
00:45:23,212 --> 00:45:24,643
Marylyn said that a ton
of people

775
00:45:24,645 --> 00:45:26,181
have gone missing
in this forest.

776
00:45:28,116 --> 00:45:30,050
Why didn't you tell us this,
McKenzie?

777
00:45:30,052 --> 00:45:33,219
I didn't believe any of it.
I didn't...

778
00:45:33,221 --> 00:45:35,255
I mean, the shit the guy
at the restaurant was saying,

779
00:45:35,257 --> 00:45:36,459
it sounded ridiculous.

780
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:40,462
But I don't think it is.

781
00:45:41,429 --> 00:45:42,632
I think it's all real, and...

782
00:45:43,799 --> 00:45:46,065
This place is dangerous.

783
00:45:46,067 --> 00:45:48,236
I don't think we are
where we think we are.

784
00:45:49,071 --> 00:45:50,072
Where are we?

785
00:45:50,739 --> 00:45:52,007
Another world.

786
00:45:58,212 --> 00:45:59,746
Pack the stuff, we're leaving.

787
00:45:59,748 --> 00:46:00,813
Martin,
please don't...

788
00:46:00,815 --> 00:46:03,315
Don't you fucking touch me.

789
00:46:03,317 --> 00:46:04,520
You believe this shit?

790
00:46:05,487 --> 00:46:07,156
I don't know, man, do you?

791
00:46:08,424 --> 00:46:09,456
I think I'd rather be the guy
who believes it

792
00:46:09,458 --> 00:46:12,491
and nothing happens
than the other way around.

793
00:46:12,493 --> 00:46:15,094
Pack up the stuff,
we're leaving in ten.

794
00:46:15,096 --> 00:46:17,163
- Come on.
- Darcy, please.

795
00:46:17,165 --> 00:46:18,398
No, wait, wait, wait.
Okay, okay.

796
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:20,166
I know, I know,
I know I fucked up.

797
00:46:20,168 --> 00:46:21,500
I should have just told you
from the start.

798
00:46:23,072 --> 00:46:24,538
But it's Marylyn.
Marylyn's out there

799
00:46:24,540 --> 00:46:25,771
and she's in danger.

800
00:46:25,773 --> 00:46:29,108
All of us are in danger now,
McKenzie.

801
00:46:29,110 --> 00:46:30,110
Take a look outside.

802
00:46:30,112 --> 00:46:32,679
There is something strange
about this place.

803
00:46:32,681 --> 00:46:33,579
Now we will find Marylyn.

804
00:46:33,581 --> 00:46:35,614
But first, we need
to get out of here,

805
00:46:35,616 --> 00:46:37,052
and we need to figure out
what to do.

806
00:46:39,587 --> 00:46:41,023
Martin, please!

807
00:46:41,589 --> 00:46:42,624
Fuck!

808
00:46:43,324 --> 00:46:44,326
Fuck!

809
00:47:01,375 --> 00:47:04,177
Fine, if you guys wanna just go
ahead and leave that's fine!

810
00:47:04,179 --> 00:47:05,277
Okay. But you are not going
to be able

811
00:47:05,279 --> 00:47:06,279
to find the door without me.

812
00:47:06,281 --> 00:47:09,449
Leave? Why would we leave?
We just got here.

813
00:47:09,451 --> 00:47:11,817
I'm about to cook up some food.
You hungry?

814
00:47:11,819 --> 00:47:14,454
You know what,
I'll get another one.

815
00:47:14,456 --> 00:47:15,458
Here you go, McKenzie.

816
00:47:18,594 --> 00:47:19,628
Where's Edgar?

817
00:47:20,628 --> 00:47:21,695
Edgar?

818
00:47:21,697 --> 00:47:24,630
He's at home recovering.
With my mom.

819
00:47:24,632 --> 00:47:26,500
No. What are you guys
talking about?

820
00:47:26,502 --> 00:47:27,733
His bag is right there.

821
00:47:27,735 --> 00:47:29,504
- No, that's my bag.
- That's not his bag.

822
00:47:30,572 --> 00:47:32,204
Where's Edgar?

823
00:47:32,206 --> 00:47:33,639
Ooh.

824
00:47:33,641 --> 00:47:36,476
Does McKenzie have
a little thing for Edgar?

825
00:47:36,478 --> 00:47:38,712
You know what? Next time,
I'll bring him just for you.

826
00:47:39,748 --> 00:47:42,882
What's wrong with you, sis?
Sit down. Come on.

827
00:47:44,853 --> 00:47:46,552
Edgar!

828
00:47:46,554 --> 00:47:48,420
Hey, grab some firewood
while you're down there,

829
00:47:48,422 --> 00:47:49,556
I don't have too much.

830
00:47:49,558 --> 00:47:50,623
I swear to god
she's stoned.

831
00:47:50,625 --> 00:47:52,427
I knew that she had
a thing for him.

832
00:48:00,302 --> 00:48:02,305
Fuck.

833
00:48:03,938 --> 00:48:05,207
Okay.

834
00:48:05,607 --> 00:48:07,407
Okay.

835
00:48:17,418 --> 00:48:19,589
Come on, come on, come on.

836
00:48:23,257 --> 00:48:24,757
Uh, hello?

837
00:48:24,759 --> 00:48:26,495
You believe me now, don't you?

838
00:48:28,596 --> 00:48:30,730
- Yes.
- <i>That's good.</i>

839
00:48:30,732 --> 00:48:32,898
Now we can get to work.

840
00:48:32,900 --> 00:48:34,400
<i>Did you find
the necklace?</i>

841
00:48:34,402 --> 00:48:36,538
Yes, I found it.

842
00:48:37,538 --> 00:48:38,607
I got it.

843
00:48:39,273 --> 00:48:40,308
That's good.

844
00:48:43,612 --> 00:48:45,277
Have you seen her?

845
00:48:45,279 --> 00:48:48,216
No, Marylyn's not even here.

846
00:48:50,319 --> 00:48:51,851
And my friends, there's
something wrong with them.

847
00:48:51,853 --> 00:48:54,420
They're all confused.
They don't even...

848
00:48:54,422 --> 00:48:56,223
They don't even know
where we are.

849
00:48:56,225 --> 00:48:57,627
Well, they're coming for you.

850
00:48:58,726 --> 00:48:59,929
You've been in there too long.

851
00:49:02,496 --> 00:49:03,498
Who's coming?

852
00:49:04,398 --> 00:49:06,299
<i>The pale ones.</i>

853
00:49:06,301 --> 00:49:08,203
The one's messing
with your friend's minds.

854
00:49:10,505 --> 00:49:12,538
Where the fuck is my sister?

855
00:49:12,540 --> 00:49:14,007
You said that she was here.

856
00:49:14,009 --> 00:49:15,608
<i>She must have left.</i>

857
00:49:15,610 --> 00:49:18,244
I can help you find her.

858
00:49:18,246 --> 00:49:20,012
<i>But you need
to get your friends.</i>

859
00:49:20,014 --> 00:49:21,348
<i>You need to give them the vial.</i>

860
00:49:21,350 --> 00:49:22,518
You need to get out of there.

861
00:49:23,719 --> 00:49:25,317
<i>You're running out of time.</i>

862
00:49:25,319 --> 00:49:26,388
They're coming.

863
00:49:27,755 --> 00:49:31,493
My friend Edgar, he's missing.

864
00:49:32,761 --> 00:49:33,960
<i>Find him.</i>

865
00:49:33,962 --> 00:49:35,364
Then call me back.

866
00:50:44,766 --> 00:50:46,369
Martin. Martin.

867
00:50:47,435 --> 00:50:48,470
Where's Darcy?

868
00:50:49,538 --> 00:50:52,105
Darcy, she's, uh...

869
00:50:52,107 --> 00:50:53,409
Here, drink this.

870
00:50:56,078 --> 00:50:57,380
Okay.

871
00:51:00,815 --> 00:51:01,947
Where's Darcy?

872
00:51:01,949 --> 00:51:03,782
Oh, thank, god.

873
00:51:03,784 --> 00:51:06,855
I don't know.
I couldn't find Edgar, either.

874
00:51:08,422 --> 00:51:09,855
What happened to us?

875
00:51:12,127 --> 00:51:13,893
- You hear that?
- What is that?

876
00:51:13,895 --> 00:51:16,695
It sounds like screaming.

877
00:51:16,697 --> 00:51:18,732
- Oh, my god.
- Help!

878
00:51:18,734 --> 00:51:19,801
Darcy.

879
00:51:41,690 --> 00:51:43,726
Go! Fucking go with Martin!

880
00:51:46,795 --> 00:51:47,830
Fuck!

881
00:51:53,168 --> 00:51:54,470
Please, stop!

882
00:51:55,136 --> 00:51:56,805
Please!

883
00:52:00,040 --> 00:52:01,376
We know what you are.

884
00:52:02,610 --> 00:52:04,643
We know what you are!

885
00:52:04,645 --> 00:52:06,114
You fucked him didn't you?

886
00:52:06,815 --> 00:52:08,384
You fucked him.

887
00:52:11,652 --> 00:52:13,453
Let her go!

888
00:52:13,455 --> 00:52:15,188
I can smell it on you!
You fucked him.

889
00:52:15,190 --> 00:52:16,659
I can smell it on you.

890
00:52:18,692 --> 00:52:20,495
You fucking disgust me!

891
00:52:22,130 --> 00:52:24,130
I can smell it on you.

892
00:52:24,132 --> 00:52:26,469
No, please don't.
Please don't.

893
00:52:29,103 --> 00:52:30,770
Edgar, stop!

894
00:52:30,772 --> 00:52:32,038
Help! Help!

895
00:52:32,040 --> 00:52:33,672
Help! Help!

896
00:52:33,674 --> 00:52:35,074
Please, this man's gone crazy!

897
00:52:35,076 --> 00:52:36,775
- Please!
- Edgar.

898
00:52:36,777 --> 00:52:38,110
- Stop.
- Please!

899
00:52:38,112 --> 00:52:40,012
Please, stop!

900
00:52:40,014 --> 00:52:41,484
Distract him.

901
00:52:43,485 --> 00:52:44,884
You have the devil
inside you.

902
00:52:44,886 --> 00:52:45,987
- Edgar!
- On three.

903
00:52:46,755 --> 00:52:49,521
Edgar, no, no, no.

904
00:52:49,523 --> 00:52:51,491
They're gonna hunt you
all down.

905
00:52:51,493 --> 00:52:52,494
Look at me.

906
00:52:52,993 --> 00:52:54,059
Martin.

907
00:52:54,061 --> 00:52:55,494
One.

908
00:52:55,496 --> 00:52:57,831
They're gonna rip you open.

909
00:52:57,833 --> 00:52:59,465
No! Martin!

910
00:52:59,467 --> 00:53:00,900
Edgar! Two.

911
00:53:00,902 --> 00:53:02,501
- And devour you...
- Edgar, please.

912
00:53:02,503 --> 00:53:03,636
...from the inside.

913
00:53:03,638 --> 00:53:05,103
Three!

914
00:53:07,676 --> 00:53:09,808
No! No! No!

915
00:53:09,810 --> 00:53:10,876
Go help him.

916
00:53:10,878 --> 00:53:11,945
I'm fine.

917
00:53:11,947 --> 00:53:13,679
I'm fine. Help him
with the door.

918
00:53:13,681 --> 00:53:15,683
I'm fine. Help him
with the fucking door!

919
00:53:19,487 --> 00:53:20,989
Shit!

920
00:53:25,092 --> 00:53:26,561
You gotta put
pressure on it.

921
00:53:27,194 --> 00:53:28,594
Try to be still.

922
00:53:28,596 --> 00:53:29,996
It'll bleed more if you move.

923
00:53:31,766 --> 00:53:33,666
Try not to move, baby.

924
00:53:37,205 --> 00:53:39,639
I don't know what to do.

925
00:53:39,641 --> 00:53:41,241
We have to get her
to a hospital.

926
00:53:41,243 --> 00:53:42,741
Right now.

927
00:53:44,045 --> 00:53:46,112
Who are you? Who are you people?

928
00:53:46,114 --> 00:53:48,081
Who are you people?

929
00:53:48,083 --> 00:53:49,581
Do you have any more
of those vials?

930
00:53:49,583 --> 00:53:50,650
I only have one more.

931
00:53:50,652 --> 00:53:52,217
- Get it!
- Okay. Okay.

932
00:53:56,123 --> 00:53:57,757
Breathe. Just breathe.

933
00:54:00,027 --> 00:54:01,226
What...

934
00:54:01,228 --> 00:54:02,764
- Give me that!
- What about Edgar?

935
00:54:07,235 --> 00:54:08,237
Drink this.

936
00:54:10,170 --> 00:54:11,706
- It'll help you.
- God.

937
00:54:12,139 --> 00:54:14,072
Hey. Hey.

938
00:54:14,074 --> 00:54:16,478
- You okay?
- My ankle is broken.

939
00:54:17,212 --> 00:54:19,081
Don't worry about me. Fix Darcy.

940
00:54:23,217 --> 00:54:24,219
Where's Edgar?

941
00:54:28,956 --> 00:54:30,993
He went crazy.
We had to lock him up, okay?

942
00:54:32,326 --> 00:54:34,994
He's having a manic episode.

943
00:54:34,996 --> 00:54:37,130
He's... He's not crazy.
It's just...

944
00:54:37,132 --> 00:54:38,630
We need to help him.

945
00:54:38,632 --> 00:54:40,268
No, that's not what this is.

946
00:54:42,636 --> 00:54:44,105
Fucking, it's something else.

947
00:54:48,076 --> 00:54:49,978
Somebody, help me!

948
00:54:51,313 --> 00:54:53,012
Breathe.

949
00:54:53,014 --> 00:54:55,050
Hey, don't get too close to him.

950
00:54:56,685 --> 00:54:57,916
Shh, look at me.

951
00:54:57,918 --> 00:54:59,054
Breathe.

952
00:55:00,154 --> 00:55:01,223
Please!

953
00:55:04,893 --> 00:55:05,895
McKenzie.

954
00:55:09,730 --> 00:55:11,029
McKenzie,
you're freaking me out.

955
00:55:11,031 --> 00:55:12,230
Please tell me what is going on.

956
00:55:12,232 --> 00:55:13,601
Why am I chained up?

957
00:55:14,902 --> 00:55:17,272
There's blood all over my hands.

958
00:55:19,306 --> 00:55:20,672
Okay, please. Please.

959
00:55:20,674 --> 00:55:21,873
McKenzie, just talk to me.

960
00:55:21,875 --> 00:55:22,977
Tell me what's going on. Please.

961
00:55:24,779 --> 00:55:25,813
You don't remember?

962
00:55:27,382 --> 00:55:28,617
Huh?

963
00:55:32,186 --> 00:55:33,322
No, I don't.

964
00:55:35,790 --> 00:55:36,792
Remember what?

965
00:55:39,661 --> 00:55:40,996
Did something happen? Did I...

966
00:55:41,996 --> 00:55:43,299
Did I do something?

967
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:46,331
McKenzie, what happened?

968
00:55:46,333 --> 00:55:48,000
You're freaking me out!

969
00:55:48,002 --> 00:55:50,205
There's a fucking bite
on my hand!

970
00:55:52,040 --> 00:55:53,074
Where's Martin?

971
00:55:55,710 --> 00:55:58,811
McKenzie...
McKenzie, where's Darcy?

972
00:55:58,813 --> 00:56:00,115
Please, help. Where's Darcy?

973
00:56:01,650 --> 00:56:04,150
No. No, don't go.

974
00:56:04,152 --> 00:56:05,384
Please. I don't remember.

975
00:56:05,386 --> 00:56:08,221
I don't remember.
Please, just talk to me!

976
00:56:08,223 --> 00:56:10,223
McKenzie, just talk to me,
please!

977
00:56:10,225 --> 00:56:12,025
I don't remember.

978
00:56:12,027 --> 00:56:13,228
I don't remember.

979
00:56:16,964 --> 00:56:18,700
What the fuck is going on?

980
00:56:27,808 --> 00:56:29,377
Oh, fuck!

981
00:56:33,380 --> 00:56:34,382
How is he?

982
00:56:36,284 --> 00:56:38,250
I mean, he doesn't remember
a thing.

983
00:56:38,252 --> 00:56:39,786
Please! Help me!

984
00:56:39,788 --> 00:56:41,788
He seems completely fine,
Martin.

985
00:56:41,790 --> 00:56:42,791
Yeah, well, he's not!

986
00:56:43,458 --> 00:56:44,793
And neither is she.

987
00:56:46,994 --> 00:56:49,964
He is chained up, he can't hurt
anyone else or himself.

988
00:56:52,032 --> 00:56:53,701
Now we need to get her
to a hospital.

989
00:56:54,902 --> 00:56:56,071
Fuck it! Help me!

990
00:56:57,806 --> 00:56:59,371
All right, baby, listen to me.

991
00:56:59,373 --> 00:57:02,208
We're gonna lift you up
really slow, okay?

992
00:57:02,210 --> 00:57:04,009
I'm gonna get you out of here.

993
00:57:04,011 --> 00:57:05,110
One...

994
00:57:05,112 --> 00:57:06,179
Two...

995
00:57:06,181 --> 00:57:08,313
Three.

996
00:57:09,750 --> 00:57:10,918
We can't be moving her.

997
00:57:15,757 --> 00:57:17,322
You have to run for help.

998
00:57:17,324 --> 00:57:18,761
You know where the portal is.

999
00:57:20,027 --> 00:57:21,295
I'll keep after these three.

1000
00:57:22,831 --> 00:57:23,962
You get to that car,

1001
00:57:23,964 --> 00:57:25,831
and you drive
as fast as you can,

1002
00:57:25,833 --> 00:57:26,935
and you call for help.

1003
00:57:32,172 --> 00:57:33,775
- Okay?
- Okay.

1004
00:57:35,743 --> 00:57:36,744
Okay.

1005
00:57:47,455 --> 00:57:48,456
Shit.

1006
00:57:50,190 --> 00:57:51,757
Fuck!

1007
00:57:51,759 --> 00:57:52,794
Shut it!

1008
00:57:53,460 --> 00:57:54,527
Check that window!

1009
00:57:54,529 --> 00:57:55,527
Check that window!

1010
00:57:55,529 --> 00:57:56,931
Please don't jump out.
Please don't jump out.

1011
00:57:58,500 --> 00:58:00,366
Nope. There's nothing there.

1012
00:58:00,368 --> 00:58:02,003
What the fuck was that thing?

1013
00:58:02,804 --> 00:58:04,337
It was his wife.

1014
00:58:04,339 --> 00:58:05,804
From the picture?

1015
00:58:05,806 --> 00:58:07,172
What the fuck is wrong with her?

1016
00:58:07,174 --> 00:58:08,176
I don't know.

1017
00:58:08,942 --> 00:58:09,944
What do we do?

1018
00:58:12,080 --> 00:58:13,081
Does that work here?

1019
00:58:14,181 --> 00:58:15,248
Call 911.

1020
00:58:15,250 --> 00:58:17,416
Have them pin our location
and send an ambulance.

1021
00:58:17,418 --> 00:58:19,786
Oh, fuck that. Tell them
send a goddamn helicopter.

1022
00:58:19,788 --> 00:58:21,757
- Get us off this mountain!
- Okay!

1023
00:58:27,462 --> 00:58:30,862
Uh, 911? Yes, we're
in Cinder National Park.

1024
00:58:30,864 --> 00:58:32,297
Two of my friends
are very badly injured.

1025
00:58:32,299 --> 00:58:33,935
We need medical assistance,
please.

1026
00:58:34,502 --> 00:58:35,737
<i>Hey, kid.</i>

1027
00:58:38,139 --> 00:58:39,174
Leon?

1028
00:58:40,842 --> 00:58:42,010
<i>Did you find Edgar?</i>

1029
00:58:44,045 --> 00:58:45,210
Something's wrong with him.

1030
00:58:45,212 --> 00:58:47,115
He went crazy.
He attacked one of us.

1031
00:58:47,915 --> 00:58:48,950
Put it on speaker.

1032
00:58:53,955 --> 00:58:55,357
<i>Have you seen my wife?</i>

1033
00:58:57,058 --> 00:58:58,891
She's out there.

1034
00:58:58,893 --> 00:58:59,994
Somewhere.

1035
00:59:01,529 --> 00:59:03,161
I thought you said
that they wouldn't be able

1036
00:59:03,163 --> 00:59:06,331
to make us see things,
if we drank the vials.

1037
00:59:06,333 --> 00:59:08,036
<i>The drink will keep
the visions out.</i>

1038
00:59:10,138 --> 00:59:11,540
<i>She's not a vision, she's real.</i>

1039
00:59:14,007 --> 00:59:16,011
<i>A demon's inside her,
like your friend.</i>

1040
00:59:18,378 --> 00:59:19,547
Well, how do we get it
out of him?

1041
00:59:20,982 --> 00:59:23,181
<i>You can't.</i>

1042
00:59:23,183 --> 00:59:24,986
<i>You need to leave.
Go to the portal.</i>

1043
00:59:26,054 --> 00:59:27,920
Where is Marylyn?

1044
00:59:27,922 --> 00:59:29,424
Where the fuck is our sister?

1045
00:59:34,862 --> 00:59:36,364
She was never here, was she?

1046
00:59:40,067 --> 00:59:42,268
<i>No.</i>

1047
00:59:42,270 --> 00:59:45,474
<i>But I can show you where she is,
if you bring me the necklace.</i>

1048
00:59:46,574 --> 00:59:48,241
<i>Go to the portal,</i>

1049
00:59:48,243 --> 00:59:49,444
<i>I'll have someone
meet you there.</i>

1050
00:59:50,478 --> 00:59:51,580
<i>Go now.</i>

1051
00:59:52,980 --> 00:59:54,015
Portal?

1052
00:59:55,415 --> 00:59:56,949
He lied to me.

1053
00:59:56,951 --> 00:59:58,016
She was never here.

1054
00:59:58,018 --> 00:59:59,985
What does he mean by portal?

1055
00:59:59,987 --> 01:00:02,054
It's the way that we came in.

1056
01:00:02,056 --> 01:00:03,655
The path that we turned off on.
It's like a door.

1057
01:00:03,657 --> 01:00:05,157
Is that how
you had me walk first?

1058
01:00:05,159 --> 01:00:06,558
Oh, you fucking bitch.

1059
01:00:06,560 --> 01:00:07,626
- Shut up!
- Enough!

1060
01:00:07,628 --> 01:00:10,429
Enough! Both of you.

1061
01:00:10,431 --> 01:00:13,467
Now, we need to focus
on what we do now.

1062
01:00:15,270 --> 01:00:16,271
Huh?

1063
01:00:18,038 --> 01:00:19,174
I'll make a run for it.

1064
01:00:23,944 --> 01:00:25,080
Just take this.

1065
01:00:26,647 --> 01:00:29,250
Keep trying, and tell him
to send help.

1066
01:00:55,543 --> 01:00:56,545
Hey.

1067
01:00:58,612 --> 01:01:00,482
<i>McKenzie went
to get help, okay?</i>

1068
01:01:02,449 --> 01:01:03,648
That hurts.

1069
01:01:03,650 --> 01:01:04,583
I know.

1070
01:01:04,585 --> 01:01:07,619
I know, but yeah,
you're gonna be fine.

1071
01:01:07,621 --> 01:01:09,020
Okay?

1072
01:01:09,022 --> 01:01:10,456
Look at me.

1073
01:01:10,458 --> 01:01:11,593
I promise you.

1074
01:01:12,393 --> 01:01:13,462
You're good.

1075
01:01:15,395 --> 01:01:17,630
Where's Edgar? Is he okay?

1076
01:01:17,632 --> 01:01:20,132
Yeah. Uh...

1077
01:01:20,134 --> 01:01:23,201
We had to lock him up,
but he can't hurt anyone. Okay?

1078
01:01:23,203 --> 01:01:24,672
Shh.

1079
01:01:27,208 --> 01:01:29,407
It wasn't him.
He didn't mean to do it.

1080
01:01:29,409 --> 01:01:31,480
- He's sick. He's sick.
- Oh, I know. I know.

1081
01:01:32,513 --> 01:01:33,547
It's not him.

1082
01:02:11,552 --> 01:02:12,554
Please.

1083
01:02:17,125 --> 01:02:18,327
McKenzie went to get help.

1084
01:02:19,360 --> 01:02:20,362
Martin, please.

1085
01:02:22,563 --> 01:02:24,532
Please take me out
of these chains, man.

1086
01:02:25,600 --> 01:02:26,969
What's in you, man?

1087
01:02:28,536 --> 01:02:29,538
Huh? Is it...

1088
01:02:44,185 --> 01:02:46,684
Oh, fuck! It burns!

1089
01:02:46,686 --> 01:02:50,188
Oh, god, Martin, it burns.
It burns on the inside!

1090
01:02:50,190 --> 01:02:51,456
Martin.

1091
01:02:59,132 --> 01:03:01,335
They're coming for you.

1092
01:03:02,170 --> 01:03:03,268
Eddie!

1093
01:03:03,270 --> 01:03:04,739
Run.

1094
01:03:06,306 --> 01:03:07,708
Run.

1095
01:03:08,708 --> 01:03:10,311
They're coming for you.

1096
01:03:14,081 --> 01:03:15,317
They're coming for you!

1097
01:03:20,587 --> 01:03:21,622
Run!

1098
01:03:23,790 --> 01:03:25,760
They're coming for you!

1099
01:03:30,364 --> 01:03:32,398
Goddamn it, Darcy,
what are you doing?

1100
01:03:32,400 --> 01:03:33,535
I want to see him.

1101
01:03:34,768 --> 01:03:36,768
He didn't mean to do it, please.

1102
01:03:40,741 --> 01:03:42,277
Where the fuck is Gerrik?

1103
01:03:47,147 --> 01:03:48,783
Listen to me.
I need you to stay here.

1104
01:03:50,485 --> 01:03:51,486
Gerrik!

1105
01:03:52,453 --> 01:03:53,455
Gerrik?

1106
01:03:54,355 --> 01:03:55,557
You promised me.

1107
01:03:57,157 --> 01:03:58,324
You said you loved me.

1108
01:03:58,326 --> 01:03:59,594
I never loved you.

1109
01:04:01,462 --> 01:04:02,630
You left me.

1110
01:04:03,531 --> 01:04:05,764
You disgusted me.

1111
01:04:05,766 --> 01:04:07,469
I couldn't look at you
any longer.

1112
01:04:10,571 --> 01:04:11,572
Why?

1113
01:04:12,473 --> 01:04:13,475
You're worthless.

1114
01:04:14,808 --> 01:04:16,644
Who would love someone like you?

1115
01:04:18,346 --> 01:04:19,414
You.

1116
01:04:21,715 --> 01:04:23,415
You said you loved me.

1117
01:04:23,417 --> 01:04:24,418
I lied.

1118
01:04:28,788 --> 01:04:30,655
No one loves you.

1119
01:04:30,657 --> 01:04:31,793
No one loves you.

1120
01:04:32,527 --> 01:04:34,159
My friends do.

1121
01:04:34,161 --> 01:04:35,163
Where are they?

1122
01:04:36,163 --> 01:04:37,496
Helping Darcy.

1123
01:04:37,498 --> 01:04:38,633
They're not helping you.

1124
01:04:40,534 --> 01:04:41,670
Come with me.

1125
01:04:42,402 --> 01:04:43,404
Where?

1126
01:04:44,772 --> 01:04:45,873
I'll show you.

1127
01:04:47,275 --> 01:04:48,477
I'll show you.

1128
01:04:57,317 --> 01:04:58,419
Gerrik!

1129
01:05:01,956 --> 01:05:03,158
Hello?

1130
01:05:09,630 --> 01:05:12,864
Hello? Listen, man,
I know you're there.

1131
01:05:12,866 --> 01:05:13,868
Hello?

1132
01:05:20,373 --> 01:05:22,241
Fuck. Listen to me.

1133
01:05:22,243 --> 01:05:23,308
I need you to stay here.

1134
01:05:23,310 --> 01:05:24,311
I'll be right back.

1135
01:05:40,994 --> 01:05:42,864
Oh, Marylyn.

1136
01:05:48,502 --> 01:05:49,538
Are you okay?

1137
01:05:50,705 --> 01:05:51,739
Marylyn.

1138
01:05:52,672 --> 01:05:53,739
Okay.

1139
01:05:53,741 --> 01:05:54,840
Okay.

1140
01:06:17,831 --> 01:06:18,833
Gerrik!

1141
01:06:20,567 --> 01:06:21,735
Darcy!

1142
01:06:25,672 --> 01:06:26,674
Edgar.

1143
01:06:32,980 --> 01:06:36,315
Darcy, please!
Darcy, help me!

1144
01:06:36,317 --> 01:06:38,284
Help me, please.

1145
01:06:44,792 --> 01:06:45,860
Darcy.

1146
01:06:46,927 --> 01:06:48,763
Please help me.

1147
01:06:52,699 --> 01:06:53,734
Gerrik!

1148
01:07:08,449 --> 01:07:09,517
Leon.

1149
01:07:10,618 --> 01:07:11,583
Look, man.

1150
01:07:11,585 --> 01:07:14,085
I know that whatever
is happening out here,

1151
01:07:14,087 --> 01:07:15,756
is way bigger than all of us.

1152
01:07:17,657 --> 01:07:21,492
My fiancée, she is hurt
really bad.

1153
01:07:21,494 --> 01:07:23,797
She needs help, man,
or she's not gonna make it.

1154
01:07:36,543 --> 01:07:37,645
Darcy, what happened?

1155
01:07:39,846 --> 01:07:41,382
Darcy, are you okay?
What happened?

1156
01:07:43,551 --> 01:07:45,951
I'm so sorry...

1157
01:07:45,953 --> 01:07:49,020
Oh, god, what is wrong with me?
Just fucking kill me now.

1158
01:07:49,022 --> 01:07:50,956
I can't take this.
I can't take it.

1159
01:07:50,958 --> 01:07:52,726
It's okay. Shh.

1160
01:07:54,594 --> 01:07:55,793
It's okay, I'm okay.

1161
01:07:55,795 --> 01:07:58,364
I know it's not you.

1162
01:07:58,366 --> 01:08:00,965
I would never hurt you, Darcy,
I'm so sorry.

1163
01:08:00,967 --> 01:08:02,303
I would never.

1164
01:08:04,871 --> 01:08:06,040
You're just sick.

1165
01:08:06,906 --> 01:08:08,907
I'm so...

1166
01:08:08,909 --> 01:08:10,345
What's wrong with me?

1167
01:08:11,846 --> 01:08:14,112
They put me
in fucking chains, Darcy!

1168
01:08:14,114 --> 01:08:15,814
What is wrong with me?

1169
01:08:15,816 --> 01:08:17,018
You just scared...

1170
01:08:17,951 --> 01:08:19,618
You scared them.

1171
01:08:19,620 --> 01:08:20,689
But I'm fine now.

1172
01:08:21,489 --> 01:08:22,891
I'm fine. I'm fine.

1173
01:08:23,557 --> 01:08:24,559
Please.

1174
01:08:25,759 --> 01:08:26,828
I know.

1175
01:08:27,794 --> 01:08:29,161
Please, let me out.

1176
01:08:29,163 --> 01:08:31,430
I can't stay in these
fucking chains anymore.

1177
01:08:31,432 --> 01:08:32,967
They're driving me,
they're driving me crazy.

1178
01:08:36,070 --> 01:08:38,440
Please, Darcy. If I don't
get out, I'm gonna die.

1179
01:08:40,775 --> 01:08:42,710
How? I don't...
I don't have the key.

1180
01:08:47,514 --> 01:08:48,516
The axe.

1181
01:08:51,584 --> 01:08:53,085
Darcy, get the axe.

1182
01:08:53,087 --> 01:08:56,825
Man, you got what you wanted.
And I am sorry about your wife.

1183
01:08:59,893 --> 01:09:00,895
But our friend...

1184
01:09:02,663 --> 01:09:03,895
Man, there's something in him,

1185
01:09:03,897 --> 01:09:05,530
and I don't know how
to help him.

1186
01:09:05,532 --> 01:09:06,735
<i>You can't help him.</i>

1187
01:09:07,535 --> 01:09:08,600
You can do it.

1188
01:09:12,940 --> 01:09:14,672
- You can do it.
- <i>A demon is eating him</i>

1189
01:09:14,674 --> 01:09:16,542
<i>from the inside.</i>

1190
01:09:16,544 --> 01:09:18,710
Come on, man. There's got
to be something I can do.

1191
01:09:18,712 --> 01:09:20,612
<i>You can cut off his head.</i>

1192
01:09:20,614 --> 01:09:22,814
<i>Or you can burn him.</i>

1193
01:09:22,816 --> 01:09:24,886
<i>Otherwise, he won't stop coming
for you.</i>

1194
01:09:27,855 --> 01:09:29,153
I don't think I could do it.

1195
01:09:29,155 --> 01:09:30,424
You got it.

1196
01:09:36,696 --> 01:09:38,997
Okay, okay. Stop, stop, stop!

1197
01:09:38,999 --> 01:09:40,832
Stop! Don't.

1198
01:09:40,834 --> 01:09:42,900
I can't. It hurts so bad.

1199
01:09:52,245 --> 01:09:54,481
This is all my fault.
Everything is my fault.

1200
01:09:56,249 --> 01:09:57,748
Everything.

1201
01:09:57,750 --> 01:09:59,618
I'm so sorry.

1202
01:09:59,620 --> 01:10:01,854
It's gonna be okay. Shh.

1203
01:10:02,990 --> 01:10:05,059
You're gonna be okay. Shh.

1204
01:10:06,927 --> 01:10:08,429
Will you hold me?

1205
01:10:13,901 --> 01:10:15,036
I got you.

1206
01:10:16,136 --> 01:10:17,502
Come here.

1207
01:10:17,504 --> 01:10:18,639
I got you.

1208
01:10:20,173 --> 01:10:21,176
Come here.

1209
01:10:24,111 --> 01:10:25,644
I got you.

1210
01:10:31,218 --> 01:10:32,921
Do you remember
when we were younger?

1211
01:10:34,521 --> 01:10:36,490
And mom and dad would fight,
and they would yell.

1212
01:10:38,225 --> 01:10:39,794
And you'd get so scared.

1213
01:10:41,896 --> 01:10:43,731
And you'd come into my room
and, uh...

1214
01:10:46,767 --> 01:10:48,699
And I would hold you
just like this.

1215
01:10:55,241 --> 01:10:56,975
I remember.

1216
01:10:56,977 --> 01:10:59,778
You remember that?

1217
01:10:59,780 --> 01:11:01,983
- It's gonna be okay.
- Mm-hm.

1218
01:11:02,682 --> 01:11:04,181
Yeah.

1219
01:11:04,183 --> 01:11:06,885
You're gonna be okay.

1220
01:11:06,887 --> 01:11:08,188
They're getting us out.

1221
01:11:11,926 --> 01:11:13,824
You gotta believe me.
They will.

1222
01:11:13,826 --> 01:11:15,594
They went to get us out.

1223
01:11:15,596 --> 01:11:16,731
No, they're not.

1224
01:11:23,670 --> 01:11:24,972
It won't let you go.

1225
01:11:47,093 --> 01:11:48,760
Please, man.

1226
01:11:48,762 --> 01:11:50,295
<i>You must try to get out
of there.</i>

1227
01:11:50,297 --> 01:11:52,232
<i>I'd love to know all
that you've seen.</i>

1228
01:12:09,016 --> 01:12:10,018
Darcy.

1229
01:12:15,722 --> 01:12:16,723
Darcy...

1230
01:12:20,361 --> 01:12:21,859
No. No.

1231
01:12:21,861 --> 01:12:22,864
Darcy?

1232
01:12:57,697 --> 01:12:58,865
Oh, my god.

1233
01:12:59,333 --> 01:13:00,802
We can't leave.

1234
01:13:21,187 --> 01:13:23,822
You fucking cunt!

1235
01:13:40,339 --> 01:13:41,409
Ow!

1236
01:13:42,308 --> 01:13:43,977
Why did you kick me?

1237
01:13:49,982 --> 01:13:51,949
Darcy, stay away from him.

1238
01:13:51,951 --> 01:13:54,021
- Darcy?
- That's not Darcy.

1239
01:14:04,431 --> 01:14:06,067
Go, go, go. Go!

1240
01:14:14,907 --> 01:14:16,341
What? No. Don't stop.
We can't stop.

1241
01:14:16,343 --> 01:14:18,143
This is it!
This is where we turned off.

1242
01:14:20,780 --> 01:14:22,883
Where's Darcy? What was that?

1243
01:14:24,450 --> 01:14:26,818
That was not Darcy.

1244
01:14:26,820 --> 01:14:29,956
I don't know what that was,
but it was not her.

1245
01:14:35,395 --> 01:14:36,431
She's dead.

1246
01:14:37,498 --> 01:14:39,463
Edgar killed her.

1247
01:14:39,465 --> 01:14:41,233
- I'm sorry, Martin.
- Oh, god, Darcy.

1248
01:14:42,369 --> 01:14:44,935
I'm so sorry, Martin.

1249
01:14:44,937 --> 01:14:46,938
This is all my fault.

1250
01:14:46,940 --> 01:14:47,942
I'm so sorry.

1251
01:14:49,142 --> 01:14:51,309
It is not your fault.

1252
01:14:51,311 --> 01:14:52,476
Look at me.

1253
01:14:52,478 --> 01:14:54,147
He lied to you.

1254
01:14:55,782 --> 01:14:57,015
But Marylyn.

1255
01:14:57,017 --> 01:14:58,315
She's gotta be...

1256
01:14:58,317 --> 01:14:59,887
She's gotta be in here.

1257
01:15:01,487 --> 01:15:03,320
We'll find her.

1258
01:15:03,322 --> 01:15:05,090
We're gonna find Marylyn.

1259
01:15:05,092 --> 01:15:07,058
And we're gonna make
that motherfucker pay

1260
01:15:07,060 --> 01:15:08,359
for putting us in here.

1261
01:15:08,361 --> 01:15:10,130
No, he's the only one
who can help us.

1262
01:15:11,498 --> 01:15:13,234
He's the only one
who can get us out.

1263
01:15:14,200 --> 01:15:15,335
We have to call him.

1264
01:15:17,337 --> 01:15:19,003
Cellphone.

1265
01:15:19,005 --> 01:15:20,070
What?

1266
01:15:20,072 --> 01:15:21,072
I left it.

1267
01:15:21,074 --> 01:15:22,506
- I need to go get it.
- No, no, no.

1268
01:15:22,508 --> 01:15:24,376
I can figure it out.
I can find it, okay?

1269
01:15:24,378 --> 01:15:25,310
I can find it.
Just give me a minute

1270
01:15:25,312 --> 01:15:27,147
- to think about it first.
- Just shut up.

1271
01:15:28,347 --> 01:15:29,413
Shut up.

1272
01:15:35,489 --> 01:15:36,491
What do we do?

1273
01:15:42,195 --> 01:15:43,396
- You stay here.
- No.

1274
01:15:44,063 --> 01:15:45,462
I'm faster.

1275
01:15:45,464 --> 01:15:48,332
I can get to the phone
by myself. Okay?

1276
01:15:48,334 --> 01:15:49,536
Don't go back.

1277
01:15:50,904 --> 01:15:52,170
I love you sis.

1278
01:15:52,172 --> 01:15:53,241
I'm sorry.

1279
01:15:56,843 --> 01:15:57,975
- Please.
- Just stay here.

1280
01:15:57,977 --> 01:16:00,213
Martin, I'm sorry.

1281
01:16:02,382 --> 01:16:04,616
- Please.
- I'm gonna be right back.

1282
01:16:04,618 --> 01:16:06,318
No, Martin, don't leave me.

1283
01:16:31,078 --> 01:16:32,179
Aah!

1284
01:16:49,329 --> 01:16:50,431
Martin!

1285
01:16:54,935 --> 01:16:56,201
Kenz.

1286
01:16:56,203 --> 01:16:58,636
Martin! She's in there!

1287
01:16:58,638 --> 01:17:01,007
- McKenzie!
- I'm here!

1288
01:17:02,142 --> 01:17:03,411
I'm right here!

1289
01:17:04,244 --> 01:17:05,976
Kenz?

1290
01:17:08,281 --> 01:17:11,082
- McKenzie?
- I'm here!

1291
01:17:11,084 --> 01:17:12,954
Where did you go Kenz? Come on.

1292
01:17:14,922 --> 01:17:16,156
Martin!

1293
01:17:20,227 --> 01:17:21,295
He can't see you.

1294
01:17:23,262 --> 01:17:25,529
- Why not?
- Well, he's in there.

1295
01:17:25,531 --> 01:17:27,101
You can't see the real world
in there.

1296
01:17:32,071 --> 01:17:34,171
Martin, I'm right here!

1297
01:17:34,173 --> 01:17:35,442
Here, let me help you.

1298
01:17:37,511 --> 01:17:39,213
Ow.

1299
01:17:39,980 --> 01:17:41,479
Ow, no.

1300
01:17:43,115 --> 01:17:44,985
What did you do?

1301
01:17:47,486 --> 01:17:50,188
Still can't hear you.

1302
01:17:50,190 --> 01:17:51,359
No.

1303
01:17:52,426 --> 01:17:53,660
Stop!

1304
01:17:56,663 --> 01:17:58,997
Stop!

1305
01:17:58,999 --> 01:18:01,533
No.

1306
01:18:03,102 --> 01:18:05,071
Whoo-hoo!

1307
01:18:05,638 --> 01:18:07,439
Feisty one.

1308
01:18:07,441 --> 01:18:10,308
Jesus Christ, man.
We don't have all fucking day.

1309
01:18:10,310 --> 01:18:12,143
- No!
- I might hold on to her.

1310
01:18:13,512 --> 01:18:15,113
Oh, god.
Don't make me.

1311
01:18:15,115 --> 01:18:16,648
Well, then help!

1312
01:18:16,650 --> 01:18:19,250
This is fucking pathetic.

1313
01:18:22,155 --> 01:18:23,387
Try the cross again.

1314
01:18:23,389 --> 01:18:24,689
I think she's clean.

1315
01:18:24,691 --> 01:18:26,360
Did I ask
what you think?

1316
01:18:27,593 --> 01:18:29,193
Uh...

1317
01:18:29,195 --> 01:18:30,261
I think I'm gonna burn her.

1318
01:18:30,263 --> 01:18:32,465
No, we're waiting
for Leon for that.

1319
01:18:36,268 --> 01:18:37,570
Hm. She's awake.

1320
01:18:49,182 --> 01:18:50,985
Help.

1321
01:18:51,551 --> 01:18:53,254
Here. Have a sip.

1322
01:18:55,054 --> 01:18:57,191
You know those tranqs
can really dry you out.

1323
01:18:59,325 --> 01:19:00,560
There you go.

1324
01:19:06,298 --> 01:19:07,634
Now this is gonna hurt a bit.

1325
01:19:10,803 --> 01:19:12,237
No! No, no, no!

1326
01:19:12,239 --> 01:19:13,537
Please! Please! Please!

1327
01:19:24,450 --> 01:19:26,518
Goddamn it,
I thought I told you to wait.

1328
01:19:26,520 --> 01:19:29,156
And I told you not to use
Andrew's boys anymore.

1329
01:19:30,456 --> 01:19:31,525
How are you feeling, sweetheart?

1330
01:19:32,758 --> 01:19:34,525
Oh.

1331
01:19:36,730 --> 01:19:38,729
You do that again,

1332
01:19:38,731 --> 01:19:40,665
you're gonna be
spitting up blood and teeth.

1333
01:19:40,667 --> 01:19:42,203
It's fine. It's fine.

1334
01:19:43,637 --> 01:19:45,072
I guess I deserved that.

1335
01:19:47,139 --> 01:19:48,209
Where are we?

1336
01:19:49,442 --> 01:19:51,309
Those things in the forest...

1337
01:19:51,311 --> 01:19:53,644
Don't worry.
We're far outside Cinder Park.

1338
01:19:53,646 --> 01:19:56,747
We're safe here,
we're outside the portal.

1339
01:19:56,749 --> 01:20:00,784
- What were they?
- We call them Drogyr.

1340
01:20:00,786 --> 01:20:04,588
- What do you call them boys?
- Pale fuckers.

1341
01:20:04,590 --> 01:20:06,427
See, everybody's got
their names for 'em.

1342
01:20:07,561 --> 01:20:08,725
They're body possessors.

1343
01:20:08,727 --> 01:20:10,528
That's why we needed
to do all this.

1344
01:20:10,530 --> 01:20:12,262
We needed to make sure
that you were you,

1345
01:20:12,264 --> 01:20:13,633
and not something else. Hm?

1346
01:20:15,201 --> 01:20:17,704
If my brother's dead
because of you...

1347
01:20:20,339 --> 01:20:22,239
I'm gonna kill you.

1348
01:20:22,241 --> 01:20:24,375
I'm gonna kill all of you.

1349
01:20:24,377 --> 01:20:25,413
I like this girl.

1350
01:20:27,513 --> 01:20:29,814
Now you hold your horses.

1351
01:20:29,816 --> 01:20:31,616
Your brother's alive.

1352
01:20:31,618 --> 01:20:33,553
He called me just as I was
on the way over here.

1353
01:20:34,553 --> 01:20:36,787
Okay, Leon.

1354
01:20:36,789 --> 01:20:39,623
This has been fun and all,
but you know.

1355
01:20:39,625 --> 01:20:41,728
The Carousel's starting soon
and we got to go.

1356
01:20:43,195 --> 01:20:44,328
Untie her, Charl.

1357
01:20:44,330 --> 01:20:45,833
And you keep an eye
on her, okay?

1358
01:20:47,534 --> 01:20:49,734
So, which Axiom
is it this year, boys?

1359
01:20:49,736 --> 01:20:51,402
Number four.
So we need something

1360
01:20:51,404 --> 01:20:53,171
that's gonna put those big
motherfuckers to sleep.

1361
01:20:53,173 --> 01:20:54,439
- Something...
- Nothing's gonna put

1362
01:20:54,441 --> 01:20:56,210
a Leviathan to sleep.

1363
01:20:59,178 --> 01:21:00,647
Oh, you know,
I might have something.

1364
01:21:10,456 --> 01:21:13,690
The boys around these parts
like to hold competitions.

1365
01:21:13,692 --> 01:21:16,461
They go into the different
Axioms and, uh,

1366
01:21:16,463 --> 01:21:20,301
try to survive or see
what creatures they can kill.

1367
01:21:21,433 --> 01:21:23,337
Those doors,
there's more than one?

1368
01:21:25,172 --> 01:21:27,271
Oh, yeah. There are a few.

1369
01:21:27,273 --> 01:21:29,474
A couple of sprays of this,
they won't know you're there.

1370
01:21:29,476 --> 01:21:30,678
Like bug spray.

1371
01:21:31,710 --> 01:21:33,344
Just don't get stepped on.

1372
01:21:33,346 --> 01:21:36,413
Oh.
Thank you, kindly.

1373
01:21:36,415 --> 01:21:38,750
Now you do know this is
considered cheating, right?

1374
01:21:38,752 --> 01:21:40,521
Well, we won't tell anyone
if you don't.

1375
01:21:41,420 --> 01:21:44,255
You people are sick.

1376
01:21:44,257 --> 01:21:46,460
You know what's in there,
and you just let people go in?

1377
01:21:50,429 --> 01:21:51,962
Now, now.

1378
01:21:51,964 --> 01:21:53,931
We've all lost people
in the Axiom.

1379
01:21:56,503 --> 01:21:57,868
My wife.

1380
01:21:57,870 --> 01:21:59,507
How could you let her go
in there?

1381
01:22:01,575 --> 01:22:02,710
I didn't let her go in.

1382
01:22:03,810 --> 01:22:04,879
I put her in there.

1383
01:22:06,745 --> 01:22:08,345
Why?

1384
01:22:08,347 --> 01:22:10,917
Well, now, McKenzie,
that is none of your business.

1385
01:22:11,884 --> 01:22:14,551
That's between me, and Jessica,

1386
01:22:14,553 --> 01:22:16,322
and a man no one's
gonna see again.

1387
01:22:17,691 --> 01:22:19,393
Did you put Marylyn in there?

1388
01:22:21,361 --> 01:22:22,563
I sure did.

1389
01:22:24,998 --> 01:22:26,997
You son of a fucking bitch!

1390
01:22:26,999 --> 01:22:28,866
Hey!

1391
01:22:30,536 --> 01:22:32,205
Take it easy now, little lady.

1392
01:22:34,874 --> 01:22:36,573
You put her in there?

1393
01:22:36,575 --> 01:22:39,443
Well, first, we started
with her friends.

1394
01:22:39,445 --> 01:22:41,878
But we chose a door
with a really special beast.

1395
01:22:41,880 --> 01:22:45,716
I mean this thing is a natural
born killer, a real hunter.

1396
01:22:45,718 --> 01:22:48,485
So one by one, we put
Marylyn's friends in there.

1397
01:22:48,487 --> 01:22:50,454
Each time,
it takes the bait.

1398
01:22:50,456 --> 01:22:51,922
And then I chained
Marylyn there.

1399
01:22:51,924 --> 01:22:54,494
Damn it, three weeks later,
it still hasn't killed her.

1400
01:22:56,396 --> 01:22:58,962
I knew your sister was special.

1401
01:22:58,964 --> 01:23:00,801
I think we can have us some fun.

1402
01:23:07,440 --> 01:23:09,777
You see. Marylyn's still alive.

1403
01:23:11,311 --> 01:23:14,278
And your brother's still alive.

1404
01:23:14,280 --> 01:23:16,680
I mean, there's still time,
we could save one of them.

1405
01:23:16,682 --> 01:23:18,484
Question is, which one
do you wanna save?

1406
01:23:19,486 --> 01:23:20,752
One?

1407
01:23:20,754 --> 01:23:23,257
Well, they're both still alive,
but they're in different Axioms.

1408
01:23:24,990 --> 01:23:26,326
Who do you want to save?

1409
01:23:41,574 --> 01:23:43,006
I think you're making
the right choice.

1410
01:23:43,008 --> 01:23:44,809
Shut up.

1411
01:23:44,811 --> 01:23:46,778
I guess it's like
a sisters thing.

1412
01:23:46,780 --> 01:23:47,845
I wouldn't understand.

1413
01:23:47,847 --> 01:23:50,848
I said shut the fuck up!

1414
01:23:50,850 --> 01:23:52,953
We're going to get Martin
right after we save Marylyn.

1415
01:23:57,356 --> 01:24:00,457
Where did it come from?
The Axiom.

1416
01:24:00,459 --> 01:24:03,094
Well, the story goes,
it showed up in the '50s.

1417
01:24:03,096 --> 01:24:06,530
Government came up here.
They took over the land,

1418
01:24:06,532 --> 01:24:08,832
started doing tests.

1419
01:24:08,834 --> 01:24:10,503
Then one day,
they just up and left.

1420
01:24:11,971 --> 01:24:13,706
Some boys
found a doorway.

1421
01:24:15,040 --> 01:24:17,408
Then they found another.

1422
01:24:17,410 --> 01:24:21,546
You know, people go missing
in national parks all the time.

1423
01:24:21,548 --> 01:24:25,049
Most of them are found,
but some...

1424
01:24:25,051 --> 01:24:28,051
Some just disappear
off the face of the Earth.

1425
01:24:28,053 --> 01:24:29,623
How many doors are there?

1426
01:24:30,789 --> 01:24:31,958
We've found six.

1427
01:24:33,927 --> 01:24:36,362
And what's in the other Axioms?

1428
01:24:36,963 --> 01:24:38,432
All kinds of beasts.

1429
01:24:39,365 --> 01:24:40,566
Monsters.

1430
01:24:41,935 --> 01:24:44,502
Who knows about this?

1431
01:24:44,504 --> 01:24:48,706
Well, us locals, you know,
keep it a secret.

1432
01:24:48,708 --> 01:24:50,640
If the government finds out,
they'd come up here again.

1433
01:24:50,642 --> 01:24:52,346
They'd take our land,
they'd take our houses.

1434
01:24:54,079 --> 01:24:57,383
Sometimes, secrets get out.

1435
01:24:59,886 --> 01:25:01,885
Cinder Falls there, there.
There's a door.

1436
01:25:01,887 --> 01:25:04,822
Oh, no. No, your sister's
not in there.

1437
01:25:04,824 --> 01:25:06,957
Those boys with the painted
faces, they're in there.

1438
01:25:06,959 --> 01:25:08,760
Competing in carousel.

1439
01:25:08,762 --> 01:25:11,395
Oh... Creatures in there.

1440
01:25:11,397 --> 01:25:12,598
Mighty big.

1441
01:25:31,750 --> 01:25:32,985
Cinder peak.

1442
01:25:33,786 --> 01:25:35,455
We're here.

1443
01:25:37,723 --> 01:25:40,060
Portal's straight through there.
You just follow the lights.

1444
01:25:42,928 --> 01:25:43,963
And what's in there?

1445
01:25:44,798 --> 01:25:46,367
We call it the Rapax.

1446
01:25:48,834 --> 01:25:50,870
As long as it's off hunting,
you should be okay.

1447
01:25:53,705 --> 01:25:55,439
You're not coming in with me?

1448
01:25:55,441 --> 01:25:57,910
Sorry, hun. This is as far
as my help extends.

1449
01:26:00,079 --> 01:26:01,546
Give me your gun.

1450
01:26:03,215 --> 01:26:04,685
Nice try, kid.

1451
01:26:06,151 --> 01:26:07,754
Here, I'll give you
this flashlight.

1452
01:26:08,788 --> 01:26:10,456
It gets very dark in there.

1453
01:26:11,557 --> 01:26:13,623
Now you listen to me.

1454
01:26:13,625 --> 01:26:16,730
You get in there fast,
you might just get out.

1455
01:26:20,866 --> 01:26:22,168
And what if I see it?

1456
01:26:24,471 --> 01:26:26,673
Well, like I said...

1457
01:26:28,106 --> 01:26:29,709
let's just hope
it's off hunting.

1458
01:27:49,655 --> 01:27:51,122
Marylyn? Marylyn!

1459
01:27:51,124 --> 01:27:53,224
Marylyn!

1460
01:27:53,226 --> 01:27:56,726
Okay, I'm gonna get you
out of here.

1461
01:27:56,728 --> 01:27:57,961
Were you bad, too?

1462
01:27:57,963 --> 01:28:00,898
No, no, no.
I'm here to help you, okay?

1463
01:28:00,900 --> 01:28:02,332
We were bad...

1464
01:28:02,334 --> 01:28:05,569
We're bad,
that's why we're here.

1465
01:28:06,838 --> 01:28:08,805
Okay.

1466
01:28:13,012 --> 01:28:14,845
- I can't get it.
- No! No!

1467
01:28:14,847 --> 01:28:16,780
- Shh.
- He will punish me.

1468
01:28:16,782 --> 01:28:18,315
- I'll be right back.
- No...

1469
01:28:18,317 --> 01:28:20,083
I'm going somewhere
and I'm going to get something.

1470
01:28:20,085 --> 01:28:21,918
- I'll be right back.
- No!

1471
01:28:21,920 --> 01:28:23,688
I will be right back. Shh.

1472
01:29:26,785 --> 01:29:28,952
Okay. Okay.

1473
01:29:30,022 --> 01:29:31,122
- Shh.
- Oh, he's...

1474
01:29:31,124 --> 01:29:33,224
- He's coming.
- Shh! Shh!

1475
01:29:33,226 --> 01:29:34,792
He's coming!

1476
01:29:34,794 --> 01:29:36,760
- He's coming!
- Shh!

1477
01:29:36,762 --> 01:29:37,827
Shut up.

1478
01:29:46,071 --> 01:29:47,904
Oh, no... Oh, no.

1479
01:29:53,780 --> 01:29:55,779
I can't get it.

1480
01:29:55,781 --> 01:29:57,081
You can't leave.

1481
01:29:57,083 --> 01:29:58,349
- You can't leave.
- Shh.

1482
01:29:58,351 --> 01:30:00,350
I'm not gonna leave, okay?
I'm not gonna leave.

1483
01:30:00,352 --> 01:30:02,989
I just need something bigger.

1484
01:30:04,322 --> 01:30:07,024
- Where is it?
- No.

1485
01:30:07,026 --> 01:30:09,393
No. It won't let us leave.

1486
01:30:09,395 --> 01:30:11,263
We'll be here...
We'll be here forever.

1487
01:30:14,901 --> 01:30:16,100
No. Marylyn, you can't.

1488
01:30:16,102 --> 01:30:18,301
No, no! Please, no!

1489
01:30:18,303 --> 01:30:20,706
Please, no. No!

1490
01:30:22,741 --> 01:30:25,012
What did you do?
What did you do?

1491
01:30:27,079 --> 01:30:28,948
No! No...

1492
01:31:25,303 --> 01:31:27,373
Oh, baby.
Baby, I'm sorry.

1493
01:31:29,542 --> 01:31:31,911
I'm so fucking sorry.

1494
01:31:42,922 --> 01:31:44,090
Aw.

1495
01:31:45,391 --> 01:31:46,460
Poor girl.

1496
01:32:02,575 --> 01:32:03,910
Jesus!

1497
01:32:10,850 --> 01:32:11,852
Drive.

1498
01:32:14,520 --> 01:32:17,121
Oh, god. Oh, no.

1499
01:32:17,123 --> 01:32:18,588
Oh, fuck.

1500
01:32:18,590 --> 01:32:20,890
We shouldn't be in here
without drinking the vials.

1501
01:32:20,892 --> 01:32:23,060
- Walk!
- Oh, no. Oh, no. Fuck.

1502
01:32:23,062 --> 01:32:24,461
Oh, no. Oh, no, no.

1503
01:32:24,463 --> 01:32:26,930
No, no. Fuck!
They're fucking everywhere!

1504
01:32:26,932 --> 01:32:28,431
They're in my fucking head!

1505
01:32:28,433 --> 01:32:30,600
They're fucking everywhere!
They're fucking everywhere!

1506
01:32:30,602 --> 01:32:32,469
They're coming!
They're fucking everywhere!

1507
01:32:32,471 --> 01:32:36,473
They're fucking every,
fucking, where.

1508
01:32:36,475 --> 01:32:39,877
Hey. I had you fooled there
for a moment, didn't I?

1509
01:32:39,879 --> 01:32:43,279
Eh? I got my fucking freak on.

1510
01:32:43,281 --> 01:32:44,316
You know...

1511
01:32:45,218 --> 01:32:46,353
it's been a fun ride, kid.

1512
01:32:47,152 --> 01:32:48,484
But this,

1513
01:32:48,486 --> 01:32:52,323
this is the end
of the fucking ride.

1514
01:32:57,495 --> 01:32:58,498
Hey.

1515
01:32:59,965 --> 01:33:00,967
Hey.

1516
01:33:01,601 --> 01:33:03,167
Hey, Jessie.

1517
01:33:03,169 --> 01:33:04,271
Hey, Jess.

1518
01:33:05,338 --> 01:33:06,339
Hey, babe.

1519
01:33:08,106 --> 01:33:10,142
It's good to see you.

1520
01:33:22,088 --> 01:33:23,123
Martin!

1521
01:33:27,360 --> 01:33:28,594
Martin!

1522
01:33:30,996 --> 01:33:32,865
No.

1523
01:33:34,066 --> 01:33:35,902
Please, Martin!

1524
01:33:38,036 --> 01:33:39,505
I came back.

1525
01:33:40,373 --> 01:33:41,374
I'm back.

1526
01:33:54,486 --> 01:33:55,487
I'm done.

1527
01:33:58,391 --> 01:34:01,358
I'm done. I'm done!

1528
01:34:01,360 --> 01:34:02,429
Do you hear me?

1529
01:34:04,396 --> 01:34:06,332
Come, take me!

1530
01:34:08,433 --> 01:34:09,902
Take me!

1531
01:34:34,493 --> 01:34:36,996
Come and get me.

1532
01:34:49,342 --> 01:34:50,442
Martin.

1533
01:34:56,348 --> 01:34:57,350
Oh, Martin.

1534
01:34:58,351 --> 01:35:00,317
Oh, thank god. Let's go.

1535
01:35:00,319 --> 01:35:01,321
Come on.

1536
01:35:02,588 --> 01:35:04,557
I can't believe it.
You came back for me.

1537
01:35:10,062 --> 01:35:11,064
Of course.

1538
01:35:15,334 --> 01:35:16,766
We thought we'd lost you.

1539
