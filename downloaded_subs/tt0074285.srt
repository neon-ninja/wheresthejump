1
00:00:32,980 --> 00:00:36,730
Okay, game point. 15-14.
This team serves.

2
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:40,570
Let's go. Service!
Come on! Come on!

3
00:00:45,370 --> 00:00:49,450
Keep it up! Let's go!
Teamwork! Keep playing!

4
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:56,790
- Hit it to Carrie! She'll blow it!
- Don't blow it, Carrie! Hit it!

5
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:00,880
- Carrie...!
- She blew it again!

6
00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:05,760
- We almost had the game!
- We can't win with her on the team.

7
00:04:38,430 --> 00:04:42,850
Help me! Help me!
Help me!

8
00:04:42,980 --> 00:04:45,020
Aah!

9
00:04:45,190 --> 00:04:47,020
Help me! Help me!

10
00:04:47,150 --> 00:04:49,190
Have a Tampax!

11
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:50,530
Help me!

12
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:56,990
Help me! Help me!

13
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,580
Help me!

14
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:03,750
Gross! Gross!

15
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:09,750
Carrie! Here! Plug it up! Plug it up!

16
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:13,840
Plug it up! Plug it up!

17
00:05:14,090 --> 00:05:16,430
Plug it up! Plug it up!

18
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:18,970
Plug it up! Plug it up!

19
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:21,220
Plug it up! Plug it up!

20
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:24,520
Plug it up! Plug it up!

21
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:26,650
What's happening?

22
00:05:26,770 --> 00:05:30,230
Plug it up! Plug it up!

23
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:31,820
Plug it up! Plug it up!

24
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:33,490
Plug it up! Plug it up!

25
00:05:33,610 --> 00:05:38,200
- Sue! What are you doing?!
- Carrie... she just got her period!

26
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:40,490
- Who's got her period?
- Carrie.

27
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:42,040
What are you doing?!

28
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:43,960
Plug it up! Plug it up!

29
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:45,960
Plug it up! Plug it up!

30
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:47,830
Plug it up! Plug it up!

31
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,670
Carrie! Come on, Carrie!

32
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,760
Carrie, quit it! Come on!

33
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:56,260
Stop it! Now relax! Calm down.
Listen to me.

34
00:05:56,510 --> 00:06:01,470
It's okay. It's okay. Just stand up
and take care of yourself. Come on.

35
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:04,850
Grow up. Stand up and take care
of yourself. Come on, do it. Do it.

36
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:05,980
- Do it!
- Aah!

37
00:06:08,610 --> 00:06:10,020
Did you see that?

38
00:06:10,190 --> 00:06:12,530
No...!

39
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:16,700
Get out of here. Go on. Right now. Move!

40
00:06:21,410 --> 00:06:22,450
Carrie...

41
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:31,210
Carrie, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I didn't know, okay? I'm sorry.

42
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:34,380
Baby, come on, now. Don't you know?

43
00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:39,640
I'm gonna talk to you about it.
Now just calm down. Just relax.

44
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:42,930
See? They're all gone. They're all gone.

45
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:45,180
It's gonna be okay.

46
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:04,120
- Isn't she a bit old for her, uh...
- Her first period.

47
00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:06,080
Um... yes.

48
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:14,710
Morty, until a half-hour ago, I don't even
think she knew there was such a thing.

49
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:17,670
It's really... hard to believe

50
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:20,800
a girl in high school
wouldn't know something.

51
00:07:20,930 --> 00:07:22,930
Uh, facts...

52
00:07:23,050 --> 00:07:24,600
Well, she didn't.

53
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:28,270
But I don't know why that should
surprise us, knowing that mother of hers.

54
00:07:28,390 --> 00:07:32,860
- We can't interfere with people's beliefs.
- I know, I know.

55
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:35,900
- As for the girls...
- Carrie's always been their scapegoat.

56
00:07:36,030 --> 00:07:39,110
- You've got to do something.
- I will.

57
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:42,620
But see, the thing is, Morty, that, um...

58
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:44,740
I knew how they felt.

59
00:07:44,910 --> 00:07:50,290
The whole thing just made me
wanna take her and shake her, too.

60
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:55,170
- It was just her period, for God sake!
- Well, we'll send her home.

61
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:58,460
Miss Finch,
will you send in Cassie Wright?

62
00:07:58,630 --> 00:08:00,630
It's Carrie White.

63
00:08:05,050 --> 00:08:06,680
Come in, Cassie.

64
00:08:06,810 --> 00:08:08,600
Carrie.

65
00:08:08,730 --> 00:08:11,690
Miss Finch, would you
bring in a dismissal slip?

66
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:16,070
I thought you might take
the rest of the day

67
00:08:16,190 --> 00:08:18,860
and go home,
take care of yourself, Cassie.

68
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:26,200
We're all very sorry about this incident.

69
00:08:32,370 --> 00:08:33,920
It's Carrie.

70
00:08:36,670 --> 00:08:38,800
Thank you.

71
00:08:42,970 --> 00:08:48,140
- Would you like to go to the infirmary?
- I think Carrie can go home.

72
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:56,730
Would you like a ride?
We could call you a cab.

73
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:59,070
I'm sure she can walk home.

74
00:08:59,190 --> 00:09:04,320
And, Carrie, you're dismissed from gym
for a week. Just take study hall instead.

75
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:08,620
We're all sorry about this, Cassie.

76
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:09,830
It's Carrie!

77
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:41,610
Creepy Carrie! Creepy Carrie! Ha-ha!

78
00:09:41,730 --> 00:09:42,900
Ohh!

79
00:09:43,070 --> 00:09:45,410
Ohh! Ohh...

80
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:02,090
Were you in Chicago two years ago?

81
00:10:02,210 --> 00:10:03,460
Chicago?

82
00:10:03,590 --> 00:10:06,510
Yes, Bill. Chicago.

83
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:09,140
Why, yes, I was living in Chicago.

84
00:10:09,260 --> 00:10:13,770
- You knew that. I told you that, didn't l?
- No, you didn't. I found out.

85
00:10:13,890 --> 00:10:17,060
You're looking at me so, uh, strangely...

86
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,400
Oh, Mrs White.

87
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:21,900
- How have you been, Mrs Snell?
- Fine.

88
00:10:22,070 --> 00:10:24,440
- And the doctor?
- Fine.

89
00:10:24,610 --> 00:10:28,240
- And your daughter?
- Sue is fine.

90
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:33,830
- Won't you come in, Mrs White?
- Oh, how kind of you.

91
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:41,790
- Carrie is in some of Sue's classes.
- Yes.

92
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:47,300
- Perhaps sometime she might like to visit.
- I'm here on the Lord's work, Mrs Snell.

93
00:10:47,430 --> 00:10:51,800
Spreadin' the gospel of God's salvation
through Christ's blood.

94
00:10:51,890 --> 00:10:53,140
Yes, of course.

95
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:57,190
I have something here I know is gonna
interest the doctor and you.

96
00:10:57,310 --> 00:11:01,310
The teenager's path to salvation
through the cross of Jesus.

97
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:04,030
I don't think Sue would be very interested.

98
00:11:04,150 --> 00:11:08,240
The children are wandering through the
wilderness of sin these days, Mrs Snell.

99
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:10,490
My Sue is a good girl.

100
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:12,740
These are godless times, Mrs Snell.

101
00:11:12,870 --> 00:11:14,870
I'll drink to that!

102
00:11:14,950 --> 00:11:16,910
We'll... all read these.

103
00:11:18,370 --> 00:11:20,830
Excuse me. Please sit down, Mrs White.

104
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:25,170
Hello?

105
00:11:25,340 --> 00:11:29,470
Betty, can I call you back?
Margaret White is here.

106
00:11:29,550 --> 00:11:31,590
Are you accusing me...

107
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:32,640
White.

108
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:36,060
Just let me get rid of her
and I'll call you back.

109
00:11:39,690 --> 00:11:42,520
And now... I'm going to kill you!

110
00:11:42,690 --> 00:11:46,940
I have something here, Mrs Snell,
that I think you might profit from.

111
00:11:47,070 --> 00:11:51,160
- Look, Mrs White, I'd like to contribute 5...
- Exodus.

112
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:53,070
$10.

113
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:56,950
I see.

114
00:12:12,010 --> 00:12:14,930
I pray you find Jesus.

115
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:25,940
- Wasn't that Carrie White's mother?
- Hey, I didn't hear you come in.

116
00:12:26,070 --> 00:12:27,690
What did she want?

117
00:13:10,780 --> 00:13:12,360
Yes?

118
00:13:14,450 --> 00:13:15,990
Yes?

119
00:13:33,630 --> 00:13:35,430
Thank you.

120
00:13:41,310 --> 00:13:43,310
I know you're listening.

121
00:13:43,430 --> 00:13:45,770
Come on downstairs.

122
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:05,080
Mama?

123
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:07,920
Who was that? Who called?

124
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:19,220
You're a woman now.

125
00:14:19,350 --> 00:14:22,470
Why didn't you tell me, Mama?

126
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:23,560
Aah!

127
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:28,980
And God made Eve
from the rib of Adam

128
00:14:29,110 --> 00:14:32,360
and Eve was weak and
loosed the raven on the world.

129
00:14:32,530 --> 00:14:35,320
And the raven was called sin. Say it.

130
00:14:35,490 --> 00:14:38,160
Why didn't you tell me, Mama?

131
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:40,160
- Say it.
- No.

132
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:41,530
The raven was called sin.

133
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:44,290
No, Mama... And the raven was called sin!

134
00:14:44,450 --> 00:14:47,710
And the first sin was intercourse.

135
00:14:47,870 --> 00:14:49,380
First sin was intercourse.

136
00:14:49,540 --> 00:14:50,880
I didn't sin, Mama.

137
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:53,550
- Say it!
- I didn't sin, Mama!

138
00:14:53,670 --> 00:14:54,760
The first sin was intercourse.

139
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:55,970
First sin was intercourse.

140
00:14:56,220 --> 00:14:57,220
First sin was intercourse.

141
00:14:57,380 --> 00:14:58,890
And the first sin was intercourse!

142
00:14:59,050 --> 00:15:03,970
I was so scared, I thought I was dyin'.
The girls, they all laughed at me, Mama.

143
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:06,020
- And Eve was weak. Say it.
- No, Mama!

144
00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:07,730
- Eve was weak.
- No!

145
00:15:07,850 --> 00:15:09,440
- Eve was weak.
- No!

146
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:11,650
- Eve was weak. Say it, woman.
- No, Mama!

147
00:15:11,770 --> 00:15:12,690
Say it!

148
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:14,030
Eve was weak!

149
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:15,530
Eve was weak!

150
00:15:15,690 --> 00:15:18,990
And the Lord visited Eve with a curse.

151
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:21,910
And the curse was the curse of blood!

152
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:25,870
You should have told me, Mama!
You should have told me!

153
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,080
O Lord!

154
00:15:27,210 --> 00:15:31,460
Help the sinning woman
see the sin of her days and ways.

155
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:36,510
Show her that if she had remained sinless
the curse of blood would not be on her.

156
00:15:36,670 --> 00:15:41,140
She may be tempted by the Antichrist.
She may have had lustful thoughts...

157
00:15:41,260 --> 00:15:42,220
No, Mama!

158
00:15:42,390 --> 00:15:45,560
Don't lie, Carrietta!
Don't you know I can see inside you?

159
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:47,680
I can see the sin as surely as God can!

160
00:15:47,850 --> 00:15:49,940
- Let me go, Mama.
- We'll pray!

161
00:15:50,060 --> 00:15:51,810
- We'll pray, woman!
- No!

162
00:15:51,940 --> 00:15:54,650
Pray to Jesus for all the lustful,
sinning souls.

163
00:15:54,770 --> 00:15:55,570
No!

164
00:15:55,690 --> 00:15:59,150
God visited Eve with the curse.
And the curse was the curse of blood.

165
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:00,240
No, Mama!

166
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:04,620
And he visited Eve with the second curse.
And this was the curse of childbearing.

167
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:07,580
And Eve brought forth Cain
in sweat and blood.

168
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:09,210
Genesis 3:16!

169
00:16:09,330 --> 00:16:11,620
Mama! Let me out!

170
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:14,000
Mama, please! Let me out!

171
00:16:14,130 --> 00:16:15,840
Mama, please!

172
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,760
Let me out, Mama! God...!

173
00:16:34,610 --> 00:16:38,280
Our Father, who art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name.

174
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:39,780
Thy kingdom...

175
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:06,720
Thank you, Mama.

176
00:17:11,890 --> 00:17:14,310
You can go to bed now.

177
00:17:49,310 --> 00:17:54,230
There is power, power,
wonder-working power in the blood

178
00:17:54,390 --> 00:17:56,060
of the lamb...

179
00:18:03,110 --> 00:18:05,110
Carrie?

180
00:18:05,490 --> 00:18:07,530
Carrie?

181
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,580
Carrie?

182
00:18:18,290 --> 00:18:20,000
Carrie?

183
00:18:20,170 --> 00:18:21,550
Carrie?

184
00:18:21,710 --> 00:18:23,550
Open the door.

185
00:18:23,670 --> 00:18:25,800
It's open, Mama.

186
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:37,440
What was that noise?

187
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:40,400
What noise?

188
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:45,860
Go to bed.

189
00:18:46,030 --> 00:18:49,120
Yes, ma'am. Saying my prayers...

190
00:19:08,050 --> 00:19:13,100
"What are you going to leave
for us, you people in your big cars,

191
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:16,140
spewing pollution into the air?"

192
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:21,440
"You people with heavy feet,

193
00:19:21,610 --> 00:19:24,110
trampling down the wilderness."

194
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:30,240
"You people who peer into
the back seats of our cars,

195
00:19:30,410 --> 00:19:35,330
hours after you come out
of the back doors of your motels."

196
00:19:36,870 --> 00:19:42,210
"Soon all we will have is each other."

197
00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:45,340
"And that could be enough."

198
00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:48,170
"If you will let us have room enough

199
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:50,510
and air enough

200
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:52,890
and peace enough

201
00:19:53,050 --> 00:19:55,770
to love each other

202
00:19:55,890 --> 00:19:59,060
as you never could."

203
00:19:59,230 --> 00:20:00,190
Hm.

204
00:20:00,310 --> 00:20:03,940
I... I really must say... I must confess

205
00:20:04,110 --> 00:20:08,860
this poem displays
the most extraordinary talent.

206
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:15,950
Talent extraordinary for you,
Tommy Ross.

207
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:19,120
You know, Tommy,

208
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:23,380
this is slightly different from running
touchdowns and hitting home runs.

209
00:20:26,590 --> 00:20:27,920
Class,

210
00:20:28,050 --> 00:20:30,050
any criticisms?

211
00:20:33,890 --> 00:20:35,220
Anyone?

212
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:38,560
It's beautiful.

213
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:46,690
Carrie White!

214
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:47,900
Beautiful.

215
00:20:49,070 --> 00:20:51,070
Beautiful.

216
00:20:51,780 --> 00:20:53,570
Beautiful!

217
00:20:56,030 --> 00:20:59,080
"Oh, beautiful for spacious skies,

218
00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:02,080
for amber waves of grain" !

219
00:21:02,210 --> 00:21:06,710
Is that the beautiful you mean?
Is it, Carrie, hmm?

220
00:21:06,790 --> 00:21:10,170
Well, Carrie, this is hardly a criticism.

221
00:21:10,340 --> 00:21:11,970
You suck.

222
00:21:12,130 --> 00:21:16,800
Tommy, did you say something, Tommy?

223
00:21:16,970 --> 00:21:19,640
- Who, me?
- Yes, you.

224
00:21:19,770 --> 00:21:22,520
I said "Aw, shucks."

225
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:32,200
Roll call: Blake.

226
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:32,860
Present.

227
00:21:32,990 --> 00:21:33,910
- Borne.
- Here.

228
00:21:34,030 --> 00:21:34,950

00:21:36,910 --> 00:21:38,410
- Hargenson.

231
00:21:38,540 --> 00:21:39,740
- Litton.
- Yeah.

232
00:21:39,910 --> 00:21:41,200

233
00:21:41,330 --> 00:21:43,000

00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:44,500

00:21:44,620 --> 00:21:46,130

00:21:46,250 --> 00:21:47,420
- Snell.

237
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:48,800
- Watson.
- Present.

238
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:50,920
- And the Wilsons.
- We're here.

239
00:21:51,050 --> 00:21:52,010
Okay, line up.

240
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:54,880
Line up!

241
00:21:56,140 --> 00:21:57,550
Move it!

242
00:21:59,850 --> 00:22:03,390
On your feet right now! Two lines!

243
00:22:05,810 --> 00:22:09,440
Alice and Mary, eyes front.

244
00:22:09,610 --> 00:22:11,190
Katie...

245
00:22:13,530 --> 00:22:15,570
You, too, Chris.

246
00:22:15,740 --> 00:22:18,200
And spit out that gum.

247
00:22:18,370 --> 00:22:22,000
- Where'll I put it, Miss Collins?
- You can choke on it for all I care.

248
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:24,460
Just get it out of your mouth.

249
00:22:37,220 --> 00:22:40,140
Wipe that smirk off your face, Norma.

250
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:48,230
Okay. Now I want you all to know that
you did a really shitty thing yesterday,

251
00:22:48,350 --> 00:22:49,940
a really shitty thing.

252
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:58,870
Did any of you ever stop to think
that Carrie White has feelings?

253
00:23:00,490 --> 00:23:03,540
Do any of you ever stop to think?

254
00:23:06,830 --> 00:23:10,710
No, I guess you're too busy
thinking about your dates

255
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:12,800
and the prom.

256
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:20,430
I guess you can take your pick, Chris.
Who's the lucky guy?

257
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:22,100
Billy Nolan.

258
00:23:22,220 --> 00:23:25,100
- Who?
- Billy Nolan.

259
00:23:25,230 --> 00:23:27,730
- I'm sorry, could you speak up?
- Billy Nolan.

260
00:23:27,850 --> 00:23:30,020
Well, isn't he the lucky one!

261
00:23:36,650 --> 00:23:38,660
What about you, Sue?

262
00:23:40,070 --> 00:23:42,030
Who's taking you?

263
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:43,700
Tommy Ross.

264
00:23:44,790 --> 00:23:46,080
Right.

265
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:58,470
Now, my idea for this little trick you pulled
was three days' suspension

266
00:23:58,590 --> 00:24:01,260
and refusal of your prom tickets.

267
00:24:01,470 --> 00:24:02,260
Oh!

268
00:24:02,390 --> 00:24:04,600
What...?

269
00:24:04,810 --> 00:24:07,350
God!

270
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:11,060
That'd get you where you live, wouldn't it?

271
00:24:11,190 --> 00:24:13,190
And you deserve it.

272
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:20,490
I don't think any of you have any idea
of just how nasty what you did really was.

273
00:24:22,740 --> 00:24:27,700
But the office has decided
you're to have one week's detention.

274
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:35,630
Still, there's one little catch.

275
00:24:35,750 --> 00:24:37,880
It's to be my detention.

276
00:24:38,050 --> 00:24:40,300
That's 50 minutes

277
00:24:40,430 --> 00:24:41,800
every day

278
00:24:41,930 --> 00:24:43,550
starting today

279
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:45,510
on the athletic field.

280
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:47,140
Get the picture?

281
00:24:47,270 --> 00:24:48,560
I'm not coming.

282
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:56,360
That's up to you, Chris.

283
00:24:57,820 --> 00:25:00,320
That's up to all of you.

284
00:25:00,860 --> 00:25:03,700
Punishment for skipping detention

285
00:25:03,870 --> 00:25:06,530
is three days' suspension

286
00:25:06,660 --> 00:25:09,660
and refusal of your prom tickets.

287
00:25:11,870 --> 00:25:13,880
Any other thoughts?

288
00:25:15,630 --> 00:25:18,340
Good. Now change up.

289
00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:22,050
Where are you going?

290
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:25,640
- Where you going?
- Gotta go.

291
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:28,680
- I'm not coming.
- You're really not gonna come?

292
00:25:28,810 --> 00:25:33,060
- I'm not coming.
- You're gonna miss the prom.

293
00:25:33,190 --> 00:25:35,060
Fuck!

294
00:25:35,310 --> 00:25:37,230
And... 1 , 2, 3, 4.

295
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:39,320
2, 2, 3, 4.

296
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:41,440
3, 2, 3, 4.

297
00:25:41,610 --> 00:25:43,490
4, 2, 3, 4.

298
00:25:43,610 --> 00:25:44,450
5, 2...

299
00:25:44,570 --> 00:25:46,450
Energy, Norma! Come on!

300
00:25:46,570 --> 00:25:48,200
8, 2, 3, 4.

301
00:25:48,370 --> 00:25:50,450
1 , 2, 3, 4.

302
00:25:50,620 --> 00:25:52,580
2, 2, 3, 4.

303
00:25:52,750 --> 00:25:54,370
3, 2, 3, 4.

304
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:56,540
Stretch, 2, 3, 4.

305
00:25:56,710 --> 00:25:58,380
Stretch, 2, 3, 4.

306
00:25:58,550 --> 00:26:00,630
Stretch, Norma, stretch!

307
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:02,510
Stretch, 2, 3, 4.

308
00:26:02,630 --> 00:26:04,090
1 , 2,

309
00:26:04,260 --> 00:26:05,510
bend, up.

310
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:06,890
Bend, up.

311
00:26:07,050 --> 00:26:08,300
1 , 2.

312
00:26:08,430 --> 00:26:09,600
1 , 2.

313
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:10,970
1 , 2.

314
00:26:11,140 --> 00:26:12,230
Faster.

315
00:26:12,390 --> 00:26:13,390
And 1 , 2.

316
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:14,390
1 , 2.

317
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:15,980
1 , 2, 1 ,

318
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:18,570
and 2

319
00:26:18,730 --> 00:26:20,820
and 3

320
00:26:20,940 --> 00:26:21,780
Uhh!

321
00:26:21,940 --> 00:26:23,780
..and 4

322
00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:26,570
and 5

323
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:29,030
and 6

324
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:31,740
and 7

325
00:26:31,910 --> 00:26:34,580
and 8

326
00:26:34,710 --> 00:26:36,920
and 9

327
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:39,000
and 10

328
00:26:39,130 --> 00:26:40,920
and 11

329
00:26:41,090 --> 00:26:43,050
and 12

330
00:26:43,210 --> 00:26:45,090
and 13

331
00:26:45,220 --> 00:26:47,260
and 14

332
00:26:47,430 --> 00:26:49,300
and 15.

333
00:27:23,090 --> 00:27:25,760
1, 2, 1 , 2, 1 , 2, 1 , 2,

334
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:27,220
1, 2, 1 , 2,

335
00:27:27,380 --> 00:27:28,590
1, 2, 1 , 2.

336
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:29,970
Get your knees up!

337
00:27:30,140 --> 00:27:31,390
1, 2, 1 , 2,

338
00:27:31,550 --> 00:27:32,810
1, 2, 1 , 2.

339
00:27:32,930 --> 00:27:35,020
Come on, you hotshots!

340
00:27:35,180 --> 00:27:38,060
She can't get away with this.

341
00:27:38,230 --> 00:27:40,230
I'm gonna get her.

342
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:41,980
Let it go, Chris.

343
00:27:42,860 --> 00:27:44,860
Like hell I will.

344
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:48,490
1 , 2, 1 , 2, 1 , 2.

345
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:51,660
The period's not up, Hargenson.

346
00:27:51,820 --> 00:27:54,490
- It is for me.
- Keep running!

347
00:27:54,580 --> 00:27:56,040
There are 10 minutes left.

348
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:58,210
Stick 'em up your...

349
00:28:02,090 --> 00:28:05,210
You can't hit us!
You'll get canned for this,

350
00:28:05,340 --> 00:28:06,420
you bitch!

351
00:28:06,550 --> 00:28:09,220
One more word and I'll knock you down!

352
00:28:09,340 --> 00:28:13,430
She can't get away with this
if we all stick together, Norma!

353
00:28:14,890 --> 00:28:16,720
Helen?

354
00:28:16,890 --> 00:28:17,850
Sue?!

355
00:28:18,020 --> 00:28:19,690
Shut up, Chris.

356
00:28:19,810 --> 00:28:21,400
Just shut up.

357
00:28:23,110 --> 00:28:24,980
This isn't over.

358
00:28:25,150 --> 00:28:27,440
This isn't over by a long shot!

359
00:28:27,610 --> 00:28:30,320
You're out of the prom, Hargenson.

360
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:33,370
Okay, the show's over.

361
00:28:33,530 --> 00:28:35,580
In place, run!

362
00:28:35,740 --> 00:28:37,830
1 , 2, 1 , 2, 1 , 2.

363
00:29:19,830 --> 00:29:23,540
Hang 'em high! Hang 'em low!
Come on, Bates, let's go!

364
00:29:23,670 --> 00:29:27,170
Hang 'em high! Hang 'em low!
Come on, Bates, let's go!

365
00:29:27,340 --> 00:29:28,670
- Give me a B!
- B!

366
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:29,960
- Give me an A!
- A!

367
00:29:30,090 --> 00:29:31,510
- Give me a T!
- T!

368
00:29:31,670 --> 00:29:32,840
- Give me an E!
- E!

369
00:29:33,010 --> 00:29:35,050
- Give me an S!
- S!

370
00:29:35,390 --> 00:29:37,430
Bates! Bates! Yeah!

371
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:42,190
- Guess who's entering the nationals?
- Are you kidding?

372
00:29:42,350 --> 00:29:44,350
Hey, terrific!

373
00:29:45,020 --> 00:29:47,020
What's up?

374
00:29:47,190 --> 00:29:48,980
Can I talk to you?

375
00:29:49,150 --> 00:29:52,320
- Right now?
- It's real important.

376
00:29:53,110 --> 00:29:54,530
All right.

377
00:29:54,660 --> 00:30:00,540
Tommy, if I asked you to do something
very special for me,

378
00:30:00,660 --> 00:30:02,620
would you do it?

379
00:30:02,790 --> 00:30:04,580
Yeah.

380
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:09,090
I want you to take Carrie White
to the prom.

381
00:30:22,980 --> 00:30:24,980
How's it looking there?

382
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:46,370
Ha ha ha!

383
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:47,630
Freddy!

384
00:30:47,750 --> 00:30:51,130
Wanna go over to Minsky's
for some hard stuff?

385
00:30:56,220 --> 00:30:56,760
No.

386
00:30:56,890 --> 00:30:59,010
- Huh?
- Some other time, huh?

387
00:30:59,140 --> 00:31:01,930
- You pussy!
- Gimme one of them beers!

388
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:04,270
- Suck on this, huh?
- All right!

389
00:31:18,700 --> 00:31:19,660
Yee-hoo!

390
00:31:19,780 --> 00:31:22,040
- Hey, man!
- Oh, man, those stripes!

391
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:23,040
Ooh!

392
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:24,080
Aah!

393
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:25,710
Yes!

394
00:31:30,460 --> 00:31:31,840
Oh, shit.

395
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:34,090
Watch it, you stupid shit!

396
00:31:45,270 --> 00:31:46,980
Don't call me that, huh?

397
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:48,980
Well, look what you did!

398
00:31:53,190 --> 00:31:54,280
Stupid shit.

399
00:31:55,940 --> 00:31:58,110
- I told you not to call me that.
- Look out!

400
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:00,910
Dumb punk!

401
00:32:01,070 --> 00:32:05,910
- What, are you scared?
- What, do you want to get us killed?

402
00:32:08,750 --> 00:32:10,580
Dumb shit.

403
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:14,050
You fuck!

404
00:32:48,870 --> 00:32:50,540
Okay, I'll do it.

405
00:33:03,970 --> 00:33:05,890
Take the streets!

406
00:33:08,140 --> 00:33:10,480
Hi, friend! What's up?

407
00:33:14,230 --> 00:33:16,190
Don't be in such a hurry.

408
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:18,280
Oh.

409
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:20,400
Come on...

410
00:33:20,610 --> 00:33:22,450
"Don't be in such a hurry."

411
00:33:22,610 --> 00:33:25,780
- I'm hurrying away from you.
- No, you're not.

412
00:33:25,910 --> 00:33:28,950
- Pain right in the ass.
- You don't mean that.

413
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:30,960
I don't mean that.

414
00:33:33,420 --> 00:33:36,210
You're crazier than a son of a bitch.

415
00:33:36,380 --> 00:33:38,710
Give me everything

416
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:40,220
Oh,

417
00:33:40,380 --> 00:33:42,430
sweet sigh

418
00:33:43,510 --> 00:33:44,890
Come here.

419
00:33:47,010 --> 00:33:48,930
Oh, shit.

420
00:33:50,890 --> 00:33:52,310
Ooh!

421
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:01,950
Mmm...

422
00:34:02,650 --> 00:34:04,030
Mm!

423
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:06,910
Jesus Christ, what's wrong with you!

424
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:11,660
- Can't you wait a minute?
- Well, what for? We do this all the time.

425
00:34:11,830 --> 00:34:13,830
You're so ignorant.

426
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:19,250
Yeah, but... that's what
you like about me, right?

427
00:34:19,420 --> 00:34:20,710
I know that.

428
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:22,220
Shit.

429
00:34:22,380 --> 00:34:23,220
No?

430
00:34:23,380 --> 00:34:24,220
No?

431
00:34:24,380 --> 00:34:26,590
I know what you like about me.

432
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:27,600
This.

433
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:29,100
Touch it.

434
00:34:29,260 --> 00:34:30,310
No!

435
00:34:33,100 --> 00:34:34,770
Dumb shit!

436
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:43,530
I told you never to call me that!
You are totally fucked up! You really are.

437
00:34:43,780 --> 00:34:45,530
I'm convinced.

438
00:34:47,950 --> 00:34:49,740
Billy...

439
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:55,040
Come here.

440
00:34:55,870 --> 00:34:57,880
Billy... Come on.

441
00:35:02,710 --> 00:35:04,720
Come on.

442
00:35:10,810 --> 00:35:13,220
I want you to do something...

443
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:16,520
Something important.

444
00:35:20,230 --> 00:35:21,900
Mm-hm?

445
00:35:22,030 --> 00:35:23,610
Billy...

446
00:35:26,860 --> 00:35:28,450
Billy...

447
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:31,990
Oh, Billy...

448
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:34,370
Billy...

449
00:35:34,540 --> 00:35:36,370
Oh, Billy...

450
00:35:37,210 --> 00:35:40,170
Oh, Billy... Billy... Oh, Billy...

451
00:35:43,210 --> 00:35:46,170
Oh, Billy, I hate Carrie White.

452
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:48,470
Who?

453
00:36:13,620 --> 00:36:15,620
Hi, Carrie.

454
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:18,830
Hi.

455
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:21,540
- How are you?
- Okay.

456
00:36:21,670 --> 00:36:23,840
Good. Uh...

457
00:36:25,420 --> 00:36:27,380
What are you doing?

458
00:36:27,510 --> 00:36:29,300
Reading.

459
00:36:29,590 --> 00:36:31,890
Yeah? What are you reading?

460
00:36:32,930 --> 00:36:34,930
It's about, uh

461
00:36:35,060 --> 00:36:36,600
sewing.

462
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:38,730
Sewing. That's good.

463
00:36:38,890 --> 00:36:40,140
Um...

464
00:36:40,270 --> 00:36:42,940
If you don't have a date for the prom
next Friday,

465
00:36:42,980 --> 00:36:45,860
would you like to go with me?

466
00:36:46,030 --> 00:36:52,320
To the prom? It's next Friday. I know
this is late notice, but, uh... Carrie?

467
00:36:52,490 --> 00:36:54,490
Carrie, let...

468
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:04,380
You guys go on. Practise those drills
from yesterday. I'll be right there.

469
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:16,640
Carrie?

470
00:37:16,810 --> 00:37:18,220
Carrie.

471
00:37:20,770 --> 00:37:22,810
Carrie, what's the matter?

472
00:37:22,940 --> 00:37:25,650
- What happened?
- Nothin'.

473
00:37:25,820 --> 00:37:27,690
Was it one of the girls?

474
00:37:27,820 --> 00:37:30,650
Did one of the girls do something to you?

475
00:37:30,820 --> 00:37:32,530
No.

476
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:35,240
Well, what is it, then?

477
00:37:35,370 --> 00:37:38,080
You can trust me. You know that?

478
00:37:38,490 --> 00:37:40,500
Would you tell me?

479
00:37:40,580 --> 00:37:43,000
I got invited to the prom.

480
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:47,130
That's great! That's fantastic!

481
00:37:47,300 --> 00:37:50,170
So what are you moping around for?

482
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:52,930
Tommy Ross asked me.

483
00:37:53,050 --> 00:37:54,930
That's even better.

484
00:37:55,050 --> 00:37:59,470
- He's really cute, huh?
- I know who he goes around with.

485
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:03,020
They're just trying
to trick me again, I know.

486
00:38:03,140 --> 00:38:05,150
Maybe not.

487
00:38:05,610 --> 00:38:09,190
I mean... maybe he really meant it.

488
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:11,070
Let's think about this, now.

489
00:38:11,190 --> 00:38:14,570
It might be terrific.
You might have a really good time.

490
00:38:14,740 --> 00:38:16,740
Carrie?

491
00:38:16,990 --> 00:38:21,540
Carrie, I wanna talk about this attitude
you have about yourself.

492
00:38:21,660 --> 00:38:26,170
You're always walking around
with your hair down, all moping around.

493
00:38:26,290 --> 00:38:27,960
Carrie?

494
00:38:28,090 --> 00:38:30,090
Come here, you big silly.

495
00:38:30,210 --> 00:38:33,380
I want you to look at yourself.

496
00:38:35,430 --> 00:38:37,430
Would you look at that?

497
00:38:38,140 --> 00:38:39,720
Come on.

498
00:38:41,390 --> 00:38:43,390
Now that's a pretty girl.

499
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:45,560
Look at your eyes!

500
00:38:45,690 --> 00:38:48,940
Little mascara to bring it out? Little?

501
00:38:49,110 --> 00:38:53,280
Your lips. Try some lipstick.
You have nice, pretty lips.

502
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:55,240
And your cheekbones.

503
00:38:55,410 --> 00:39:00,740
Look at your hair. It's beautiful hair. You
could just put it up a little, add a little curl.

504
00:39:00,870 --> 00:39:02,700
What do you think?

505
00:39:02,870 --> 00:39:04,750
Yeah!

506
00:39:06,580 --> 00:39:08,250
Well?

507
00:39:08,380 --> 00:39:10,380
Well, what do you wanna know?

508
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:13,010
Why Tommy asked her to the prom.

509
00:39:14,340 --> 00:39:15,720
Well?

510
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:17,890
I asked him to.

511
00:39:18,850 --> 00:39:20,680
Why?

512
00:39:21,180 --> 00:39:22,970
What for?

513
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:26,350
What could you possibly
have had in mind?

514
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:32,530
I thought it would be a good thing for
Carrie, to join in and be with people...

515
00:39:32,650 --> 00:39:35,360
- Make her a part of things?
- Right.

516
00:39:35,450 --> 00:39:37,450
Come on, Sue.

517
00:39:37,990 --> 00:39:39,990
We're not that stupid.

518
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:44,080
- Neither is Carrie.
- That means... I don't know.

519
00:39:44,250 --> 00:39:49,170
You mean you're not gonna go.
Stay home and miss your own prom?

520
00:39:49,330 --> 00:39:51,750
Come in.

521
00:39:52,710 --> 00:39:55,720
- What is it?
- The attendance sheets, Miss Collins.

522
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:58,050
You know you can't go without a date.

523
00:40:02,010 --> 00:40:04,020
Is there anything else, Norma?

524
00:40:04,140 --> 00:40:06,480
- No, Miss Collins.
- Thank you, Norma.

525
00:40:10,980 --> 00:40:13,020
Which brings us to you.

526
00:40:13,190 --> 00:40:16,320
- I have to get to practice.
- Well, that's too bad.

527
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:21,160
- If you don't mind, it's between Sue and l.
- But I do mind... unless, of course,

528
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:25,370
you'd like to continue this little
discussion in Mr Morton's office.

529
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:27,500
What is the big deal?!

530
00:40:27,620 --> 00:40:32,210
Because it is a very big deal
for Carrie White, and you know it.

531
00:40:32,340 --> 00:40:34,300
She already said no, anyway.

532
00:40:34,420 --> 00:40:37,800
- Yeah, well, you can change that.
- Don't count your chickens.

533
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:40,970
- Just don't try...
- Fine. I won't try.

534
00:40:41,090 --> 00:40:43,600
Wait a second! It's not fine!

535
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:47,770
You can't order someone
not to take someone to the prom!

536
00:40:47,930 --> 00:40:51,350
I can make sure you don't hurt
Carrie White any more.

537
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:55,530
We're not trying to hurt her, Miss Collins.
We're trying to help her!

538
00:40:55,690 --> 00:40:57,690
How?!

539
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:07,660
Hey, Tommy, um... Don't you think
you'll look a little ridiculous

540
00:41:07,790 --> 00:41:10,370
when you walk in the prom
with Carrie White?

541
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:13,080
We don't care how we look.

542
00:41:14,340 --> 00:41:16,340
Do we?

543
00:41:21,630 --> 00:41:23,340
What?

544
00:41:23,470 --> 00:41:24,890
I...

545
00:42:19,780 --> 00:42:21,690
- Hi, Carrie.
- Hi.

546
00:42:21,860 --> 00:42:24,160
So this is where you live, huh?

547
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:28,200
- What are you doing here?
- You gonna ask me in?

548
00:42:28,990 --> 00:42:30,500
Why not?

549
00:42:34,170 --> 00:42:36,170
Mama's resting.

550
00:42:36,290 --> 00:42:41,210
- What do you want?
- God, right to the point. Um...

551
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:44,340
- About the prom...
- I already told you.

552
00:42:44,470 --> 00:42:48,600
- But you can change your mind.
- Why are you doing this?

553
00:42:48,680 --> 00:42:50,720
- Cos I want to.
- No, you're not.

554
00:42:50,850 --> 00:42:52,850
I don't do anything I don't want.

555
00:42:52,980 --> 00:42:54,980
- I can't.
- Yes, you can!

556
00:42:55,100 --> 00:42:56,190
Carrie!

557
00:42:56,270 --> 00:42:59,820
- You'd better go.
- Not till you say yes.

558
00:42:59,900 --> 00:43:02,360
- No. I can't.
- Yes, you can.

559
00:43:02,490 --> 00:43:04,490
I said I can't.

560
00:43:04,610 --> 00:43:06,610
Carrie!

561
00:43:06,700 --> 00:43:08,660
Yes, you can.

562
00:43:08,780 --> 00:43:11,870
- Will you please go?
- Not till you say yes.

563
00:43:12,040 --> 00:43:14,330
Why is this so important to you?

564
00:43:14,460 --> 00:43:17,170
I don't know.

565
00:43:17,330 --> 00:43:20,170
Maybe because, um... you liked my poem.

566
00:43:20,250 --> 00:43:22,300
Carrie!

567
00:43:25,300 --> 00:43:29,470
- Okay, okay, I'll go.
- Good. I'll pick you up at 8 o'clock.

568
00:43:31,310 --> 00:43:32,890
Okay.

569
00:43:36,230 --> 00:43:38,230
What's the matter, Willie?

570
00:43:38,350 --> 00:43:41,440
We gonna wake up the little piggies?
Oink, oink!

571
00:43:41,610 --> 00:43:44,900
You know, this is a hell of a risk for a joke.

572
00:43:44,990 --> 00:43:50,370
- You want out?
- No, no. It's a good joke. It's a good joke.

573
00:43:50,490 --> 00:43:52,540
Look at this!

574
00:43:52,660 --> 00:43:54,910
- What?
- All these pigs!

575
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:57,040
What are you talking about?

576
00:43:57,210 --> 00:43:59,210
These painted pigs!

577
00:43:59,330 --> 00:44:02,420
Lauren Hanky's nitwit cousin
painted them.

578
00:44:02,590 --> 00:44:03,760
Shh!

579
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:08,050
I went out with the girl that posed for 'em.
She was a real pig!

580
00:44:08,180 --> 00:44:10,890
- Will you shut up?!
- Will you let me up there?

581
00:44:11,050 --> 00:44:13,680
You're gonna kill that pig, right?

582
00:44:15,430 --> 00:44:16,980
Piggy!

583
00:44:17,060 --> 00:44:19,100
Here, piggy!

584
00:44:19,270 --> 00:44:22,110
I'm gonna bash your little heads in,

585
00:44:22,230 --> 00:44:25,820
and you don't have to worry
about the bomb no more.

586
00:44:25,940 --> 00:44:30,110
Come here, little piggy!
Come here, you little sucker!

587
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:34,370
- Will you shut up and do it!
- We gotta give it a chance to burn!

588
00:44:34,490 --> 00:44:37,040
- Oh, yeah?
- Come here, piggy!

589
00:44:37,120 --> 00:44:41,210
You can't do it standin' out here.
Get 'er done, man, get 'er done.

590
00:44:41,290 --> 00:44:45,210
- I can't. I can't. You.
- Oh, I knew this would happen!

591
00:44:45,340 --> 00:44:49,130
- Just... hold it there, you pig. You fuck-up!
- Do it, Billy!

592
00:44:49,260 --> 00:44:51,340
- And you shut up!
- Just do it!

593
00:44:51,470 --> 00:44:56,430
All right, move it out, move it out!
That's it! Come on! Move it out!

594
00:44:58,270 --> 00:45:00,230
Yeah, that's my baby! Yeah!

595
00:45:00,350 --> 00:45:00,900
Do it!

596
00:45:01,560 --> 00:45:01,940
Do it!

597
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:03,060
Do it!

598
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:20,250
Carrie, you haven't touched
your apple cake.

599
00:45:20,370 --> 00:45:22,420
Gives me pimples, Mama.

600
00:45:22,500 --> 00:45:25,840
Pimples are the Lord's way
of chastising you.

601
00:45:26,670 --> 00:45:28,720
- Mama?
- Yeah?

602
00:45:28,840 --> 00:45:33,220
Mama, please see that I've gotta
try and get along with people.

603
00:45:33,340 --> 00:45:35,850
What are you going on about, Carrie?

604
00:45:36,640 --> 00:45:38,850
I've been invited to the prom.

605
00:45:40,310 --> 00:45:42,190
The prom?

606
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:46,770
Yeah, the senior prom. Everybody's goin'.

607
00:45:46,940 --> 00:45:50,200
It's that teacher that called... wasn't it?

608
00:45:50,320 --> 00:45:52,700
Please say I'm not like you, Mama.

609
00:45:52,820 --> 00:45:55,780
I'm funny. All the kids think I'm funny.

610
00:45:55,990 --> 00:45:57,290
I wanna be normal.

611
00:45:57,410 --> 00:46:00,830
I wanna try and be a whole person
before it's too late for...

612
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:05,920
His name is Tommy Ross.

613
00:46:06,040 --> 00:46:07,550
- He's a very nice boy.
- No.

614
00:46:07,670 --> 00:46:10,880
- He promised to stop in and meet you.
- I said no.

615
00:46:11,010 --> 00:46:14,720
- Mama, I've accepted. I've accepted.
- I said no. No, no, no!

616
00:46:14,840 --> 00:46:15,800
I've accepted!

617
00:46:15,930 --> 00:46:18,180
- Come to your closet.
- No.

618
00:46:18,310 --> 00:46:21,230
- After all you've been taught...
- Everyone isn't bad!

619
00:46:21,350 --> 00:46:23,350
Everything isn't a sin!

620
00:46:23,480 --> 00:46:26,520
Come to your closet and pray.
Ask to be forgiven.

621
00:46:26,650 --> 00:46:30,400
He's a nice boy, Mama. You'll like him.
You'll really like him, Mama.

622
00:46:30,530 --> 00:46:32,360
"Boy."

623
00:46:35,370 --> 00:46:38,330
The boys! The boys! Yes, the boys...

624
00:46:38,830 --> 00:46:41,330
After the blood come the boys....

625
00:46:41,450 --> 00:46:44,000
- Mama...
- Like sniffing dogs,

626
00:46:44,120 --> 00:46:49,630
grinning and slobbering and trying
to find out where that smell comes from.

627
00:46:49,750 --> 00:46:53,840
I know where they take them
cos I've seen it all!

628
00:46:53,970 --> 00:46:57,100
- Well, you're not going.
- Already said I would.

629
00:46:57,220 --> 00:47:00,810
Tell that boy you're not going,
or we're gonna move from here!

630
00:47:00,930 --> 00:47:01,890
No.

631
00:47:02,020 --> 00:47:04,690
We'll move and never see that boy again!

632
00:47:04,810 --> 00:47:09,270
- Mama, please say that Tommy and me...
- I'm gonna close the window.

633
00:47:09,400 --> 00:47:11,780
Mama, please sit and talk to me!

634
00:47:22,040 --> 00:47:24,040
I'm goin', Mama.

635
00:47:25,250 --> 00:47:28,250
And things are gonna change
around here.

636
00:47:29,840 --> 00:47:31,630
Witch.

637
00:47:32,550 --> 00:47:34,550
Got Satan's power.

638
00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:37,390
It's nothin' to do with Satan, Mama.

639
00:47:37,510 --> 00:47:39,930
It's me. Me.

640
00:47:40,050 --> 00:47:43,390
If I concentrate hard enough,
I can move things.

641
00:47:43,560 --> 00:47:47,020
- Satan is clever.
- No, Mama.

642
00:47:47,310 --> 00:47:49,310
I'm not the only one.

643
00:47:49,480 --> 00:47:52,900
Other people can do it. I read about it.

644
00:47:53,110 --> 00:47:58,820
You poor child. He doesn't let you know
he's working through you.

645
00:47:58,950 --> 00:48:01,830
Mama... I know.

646
00:48:01,990 --> 00:48:05,460
He entered your father
and carried him off!

647
00:48:05,580 --> 00:48:09,130
- He ran away, Mama.
- The devil tempted him!

648
00:48:09,250 --> 00:48:11,590
He ran away with a woman, Mama.

649
00:48:11,710 --> 00:48:13,670
Everybody knows that.

650
00:48:13,800 --> 00:48:17,680
You must renounce this power.
You must give it up. Never use it.

651
00:48:20,470 --> 00:48:22,470
I'm goin', Mama.

652
00:48:23,810 --> 00:48:25,810
You can't stop me.

653
00:48:25,930 --> 00:48:28,770
And I don't wanna talk about it any more.

654
00:48:45,450 --> 00:48:48,500
- Keep that damn light straight.
- Hurry up!

655
00:48:48,620 --> 00:48:53,500
Watch it, you stupid shit!
You're getting blood all over the place!

656
00:48:53,670 --> 00:48:55,630
Who you calling a stupid shit?

657
00:48:55,760 --> 00:48:59,550
I mean, you can't even keep
that fuckin' light straight.

658
00:48:59,680 --> 00:49:01,680
Just hurry up.

659
00:49:01,800 --> 00:49:06,350
Yes, ma'am! We's doin' the bes' we can!
We really are, boss!

660
00:49:06,470 --> 00:49:08,730
Hurry up. I wanna go home.

661
00:49:13,820 --> 00:49:16,360
Just... ..keep your tits, huh?

662
00:49:16,530 --> 00:49:20,410
And I'll let you pull the rope
when the time comes.

663
00:49:20,530 --> 00:49:21,870
I plan to.

664
00:49:21,990 --> 00:49:24,080
I know.

665
00:49:42,840 --> 00:49:46,350
Ernest, tonight's prom night.
Everything all right?

666
00:49:46,470 --> 00:49:51,100
- I didn't know you were interested.
- I'm a student here, amn't I?

667
00:49:51,230 --> 00:49:53,810
- I don't know. Are you?
- Sure I am.

668
00:49:53,940 --> 00:49:56,270
I wanna be on the committee.

669
00:49:56,400 --> 00:50:00,700
You're a little late.
I could've used you a week ago.

670
00:50:00,820 --> 00:50:04,700
I'm not late. I'm right on time.
I wanna collect the ballots

671
00:50:04,820 --> 00:50:08,290
for the king and queen and the voting.

672
00:50:08,410 --> 00:50:12,750
- Think we could arrange that?
- Okay. Can you be here at 6.30?

673
00:50:12,920 --> 00:50:15,290
No. No, I can't be here at 6.30.

674
00:50:15,460 --> 00:50:17,800
I'll be here at 8. How's 8?

675
00:50:17,960 --> 00:50:20,970
- Yeah, that'll do.
- See you then.

676
00:50:21,090 --> 00:50:24,510
- Take it easy.
- I'll take it any way I can get it, pal.

677
00:50:24,640 --> 00:50:26,140
Hey, Helen.

678
00:50:26,300 --> 00:50:27,430
Helen!

679
00:50:27,640 --> 00:50:28,430
Helen!

680
00:50:28,600 --> 00:50:31,100
- What?
- Did you hear about Tommy Ross?

681
00:50:31,350 --> 00:50:34,060
- What?
- Did you hear about Tommy Ross?

682
00:50:34,270 --> 00:50:37,610
- What?
- He's taking Carrie White to the prom.

683
00:50:37,770 --> 00:50:39,610
- No!
- Yeah!

684
00:50:42,030 --> 00:50:46,280
- He can't do that! Where's Sue?
- Yes, he can. He asked her.

685
00:50:46,410 --> 00:50:48,910
- What's she gonna wear?
- Who, Carrie?

686
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:50,500
A sackcloth?!

687
00:50:52,040 --> 00:50:56,000
- Sweetie, keep those stars coming faster.
- They're coming.

688
00:50:56,130 --> 00:50:59,800
What's this I hear about Tommy
taking Carrie to the prom?

689
00:50:59,920 --> 00:51:02,590
Whatever you've heard, it's true.

690
00:51:02,670 --> 00:51:06,300
Why is he doing it?
Everybody is talking about it.

691
00:51:06,430 --> 00:51:09,470
I asked him to
cos I thought I owed it to Carrie.

692
00:51:09,600 --> 00:51:13,310
- Where's that put everybody else?
- They gotta deal with it in their own way.

693
00:51:13,430 --> 00:51:16,020
- What do you mean?
- Oh... just something.

694
00:51:16,150 --> 00:51:19,690
- Well, you're not going to the prom.
- Oh, I'll be here.

695
00:51:19,820 --> 00:51:22,650
You'll be here?
What, you're going to the prom?

696
00:51:22,780 --> 00:51:26,200
I will tell you later.
You're gonna be in on it.

697
00:51:26,320 --> 00:51:28,280
I'm gonna be in on it? What?

698
00:51:28,410 --> 00:51:30,490
I'm telling you later!

699
00:51:30,620 --> 00:51:33,450
- I want to know now, Chris.
- Just wait.

700
00:51:33,620 --> 00:51:40,710
I won't tell anybody, I promise. I won't say
a word. I'm your best friend. Come on.

701
00:51:40,840 --> 00:51:42,420
Okay.

702
00:52:16,460 --> 00:52:20,790
- You gotta rent a tuxedo for the prom.
- I only got 10 bucks, though.

703
00:52:20,920 --> 00:52:23,760
You can rent a tuxedo!
You don't have to look great!

704
00:52:23,880 --> 00:52:24,880
Hey.

705
00:52:25,010 --> 00:52:26,670
Does this look nice?

706
00:52:26,800 --> 00:52:30,300
He looks beautiful. Make a good
impression for once in your life.

707
00:52:30,430 --> 00:52:32,810
- Would you go out with me?
- Not with ruffles.

708
00:52:32,930 --> 00:52:36,060
You don't have to get ruffles for yourself.

709
00:52:36,180 --> 00:52:39,190
- I don't like ruffles...
- You don't have to get ruffles!

710
00:52:39,350 --> 00:52:41,110
Don't I look sharp?

711
00:52:41,270 --> 00:52:44,610
It looks good on you,
but I don't look right in a tuxedo.

712
00:52:44,730 --> 00:52:48,360
- Have you ever put on a tuxedo?
- I don't have a tuxedo body.

713
00:52:51,120 --> 00:52:55,080
- I know they have tuxedos here for you.
- But I wouldn't look right.

714
00:52:55,200 --> 00:52:57,210
I know just the tuxedo for him.

715
00:52:57,370 --> 00:53:01,710
- Well, what do you think?
- I like it. I think it's terrific.

716
00:53:01,840 --> 00:53:03,960
Look at that. No ruffles at all!

717
00:53:14,680 --> 00:53:17,980
Red. I might've known it would be red.

718
00:53:19,140 --> 00:53:21,150
It's pink, Mama.

719
00:53:23,020 --> 00:53:25,150
Look what Tommy gave me, Mama.

720
00:53:25,320 --> 00:53:27,320
Aren't they beautiful?

721
00:53:32,280 --> 00:53:34,830
I can see your dirty pillows.

722
00:53:35,330 --> 00:53:37,330
Everyone will.

723
00:53:37,950 --> 00:53:39,960
Breasts, Mama.

724
00:53:40,120 --> 00:53:42,170
They're called breasts.

725
00:53:42,290 --> 00:53:44,290
And every woman has them.

726
00:53:48,760 --> 00:53:50,760
Take off that dress.

727
00:53:50,880 --> 00:53:52,010
No.

728
00:53:52,140 --> 00:53:56,010
- We'll burn it and pray for forgiveness.
- No, Mama.

729
00:54:09,240 --> 00:54:11,240
Well, he's not coming.

730
00:54:11,360 --> 00:54:14,910
He is coming, Mama.
Now stop it. I'm nervous enough.

731
00:54:20,330 --> 00:54:22,330
No, he's not coming.

732
00:54:24,170 --> 00:54:26,170
He's not gonna come.

733
00:54:31,670 --> 00:54:33,470
Go away!

734
00:54:34,640 --> 00:54:36,470
Stop it, Mama!

735
00:54:36,600 --> 00:54:40,020
- Stop hurting yourself, Mama!
- I'm not!

736
00:54:40,140 --> 00:54:43,650
He's gonna laugh at you!
They're all gonna laugh at you!

737
00:54:43,770 --> 00:54:46,860
- They're not gonna laugh at me!
- Stay here with me.

738
00:54:46,980 --> 00:54:49,030
I don't wanna stay with you, Mama!

739
00:54:49,150 --> 00:54:51,360
I'll tell him you're sick!

740
00:54:51,530 --> 00:54:54,200
- I'll say you changed your mind!
- Be quiet.

741
00:54:54,280 --> 00:54:55,660
Sit down! Be quiet!

742
00:55:07,340 --> 00:55:10,170
I'll tell him you changed your mind!

743
00:55:10,300 --> 00:55:12,130
Sit down!

744
00:55:13,260 --> 00:55:17,720
Just sit there, Mama,
and don't say a word until I'm gone.

745
00:55:20,310 --> 00:55:22,310
I'll be home early.

746
00:55:24,770 --> 00:55:26,770
I love you, Mama.

747
00:55:29,690 --> 00:55:32,440
Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live.

748
00:55:58,140 --> 00:55:59,970
Tommy,

749
00:56:01,310 --> 00:56:03,560
could we wait here just a minute?

750
00:56:12,110 --> 00:56:14,110
Are you scared?

751
00:56:14,280 --> 00:56:16,070
Mm-hm.

752
00:56:21,370 --> 00:56:23,410
Maybe this was a mistake.

753
00:56:23,580 --> 00:56:27,420
Oh, no. It's not gonna be that bad.

754
00:56:27,580 --> 00:56:30,500
They're a good crowd. Really.

755
00:56:31,840 --> 00:56:33,510
Really.

756
00:56:34,090 --> 00:56:36,130
Don't be so nervous.

757
00:56:36,300 --> 00:56:40,550
Besides, I'd look awfully stupid
dancing by myself, wouldn't l?

758
00:56:40,680 --> 00:56:42,260
Now come on.

759
00:56:52,070 --> 00:56:54,480
When I look back on my younger days

760
00:56:54,610 --> 00:56:57,400
I really was a maniac,

761
00:56:57,570 --> 00:56:58,950
blowing up the john

762
00:56:59,110 --> 00:57:00,450
with a cherry bomb,

763
00:57:00,620 --> 00:57:02,950
giving the janitor a cardiac.

764
00:57:03,120 --> 00:57:04,620
Well, the teacher could say

765
00:57:04,790 --> 00:57:06,250
they should lock you away

766
00:57:06,410 --> 00:57:08,790
and throw away all the keys
if you please.

767
00:57:08,960 --> 00:57:10,960
He's outta control.

768
00:57:11,080 --> 00:57:14,250
The devil's got a hold of his soul.

769
00:57:14,380 --> 00:57:15,420
Oh!

770
00:57:15,590 --> 00:57:16,920
Man, you wanted the time

771
00:57:17,090 --> 00:57:18,420
so my buddies and I

772
00:57:18,550 --> 00:57:20,760
choked upon a cigarette.

773
00:57:20,930 --> 00:57:22,430
Too tired to jog

774
00:57:22,600 --> 00:57:23,930
and you could barely walk,

775
00:57:24,060 --> 00:57:27,100
swearin' for the hell of it.

776
00:57:27,270 --> 00:57:28,940
Then when it's your right to see

777
00:57:29,100 --> 00:57:30,140
the president's daughter,

778
00:57:30,270 --> 00:57:32,230
the daughter's been so outta sight.

779
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:33,270
Right.

780
00:57:33,400 --> 00:57:34,730
Dancin' till dawn,

781
00:57:34,900 --> 00:57:37,900
my parents were clear uptown.

782
00:57:38,070 --> 00:57:39,110
Yeah!

783
00:57:39,240 --> 00:57:40,570
High school.

784
00:57:40,740 --> 00:57:41,610
Pre-school.

785
00:57:41,740 --> 00:57:43,700
No, 12 long years

786
00:57:43,830 --> 00:57:45,240
of the education blues.

787
00:57:45,410 --> 00:57:46,580
Teachers.

788
00:57:46,700 --> 00:57:47,950
Preachers.

789
00:57:48,120 --> 00:57:49,460
Don't know how

790
00:57:49,620 --> 00:57:52,130
I ever made it through.

791
00:57:52,290 --> 00:57:53,710
Oh, yeah!

792
00:58:06,640 --> 00:58:08,640
Come on.

793
00:58:08,770 --> 00:58:12,650
Ross, if I knew you'd look this sharp,
I would've taken you instead of, uh...

794
00:58:12,770 --> 00:58:13,730
What's her name?

795
00:58:13,860 --> 00:58:16,900
Don't bother about them.
If they self-destruct,

796
00:58:17,030 --> 00:58:19,030
I'll dance with you.

797
00:58:20,950 --> 00:58:24,240
Hey, where did you buy that dress?
I love it!

798
00:58:24,410 --> 00:58:26,700
- Oh, I made it.
- Made it?!

799
00:58:26,950 --> 00:58:30,910
- The decorations... don't they look great?
- Yeah...

800
00:58:31,040 --> 00:58:35,380
- I'm so nervous.
- It's okay. You can sit with us.

801
00:58:35,540 --> 00:58:38,380
- Hey, what time is it?
- 8 o'clock.

802
00:58:38,510 --> 00:58:39,590
Gotta go.

803
00:58:39,710 --> 00:58:42,380
- Where are you going?
- Just out.

804
00:58:42,510 --> 00:58:44,220
See you later.

805
00:58:44,340 --> 00:58:45,930
Sue!

806
00:58:57,320 --> 00:59:01,650
- Would you like to dance?
- Could we just sit here for a minute?

807
00:59:01,780 --> 00:59:02,950
Sure.

808
00:59:03,110 --> 00:59:05,160
Sure. Anything you want.

809
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:12,370
Carrie.

810
00:59:13,460 --> 00:59:15,330
Hi, Miss Collins.

811
00:59:15,500 --> 00:59:17,460
You look so pretty!

812
00:59:17,630 --> 00:59:19,500
You, too. You look beautiful.

813
00:59:19,630 --> 00:59:23,760
Thank you! I know I don't, not really,
but thank you, anyway.

814
00:59:23,880 --> 00:59:25,470
May I sit down?

815
00:59:25,640 --> 00:59:28,300
- Yeah. Chair...
- Thank you.

816
00:59:29,600 --> 00:59:32,480
I'm gonna go and talk to some people.

817
00:59:52,290 --> 00:59:55,540
I remember my prom.
I had a date with the, uh

818
00:59:55,670 --> 00:59:58,250
the captain of the basketball team.

819
00:59:58,380 --> 01:00:02,170
And he was 6ft 7in tall, so

820
01:00:02,300 --> 01:00:08,010
I bought a pair of 3-inch spike heels
so that our kiss goodnight would be, um

821
01:00:08,180 --> 01:00:11,970
Less awkward.
Anyway, we went in his pick-up truck,

822
01:00:12,100 --> 01:00:16,980
which of course broke down, and we
had to walk the last half-mile to the prom.

823
01:00:17,150 --> 01:00:21,270
By the time I got there, my feet were
so blistered that all I could do was

824
01:00:21,400 --> 01:00:27,450
just sit there. I couldn't dance.
So we just sat there and, uh... just talked.

825
01:00:27,570 --> 01:00:29,160
And, uh

826
01:00:29,320 --> 01:00:33,290
it was... magic. Is it like that for you?

827
01:00:33,410 --> 01:00:35,410
It's, um...

828
01:00:36,870 --> 01:00:38,880
it's nice.

829
01:00:39,040 --> 01:00:41,960
- Just nice?
- No...! It's...

830
01:00:43,130 --> 01:00:45,130
It's like, uh...

831
01:00:46,300 --> 01:00:50,140
- It's like being on Mars.
- You'll never forget it.

832
01:00:50,260 --> 01:00:52,640
I don't think I will.

833
01:00:54,600 --> 01:00:56,100
Thank you.

834
01:00:56,270 --> 01:00:58,520
Hey, what's goin' on here?

835
01:00:58,650 --> 01:01:01,860
What are you doing with my date?

836
01:01:01,980 --> 01:01:04,280
- Oh, we're just talking.
- Yeah?

837
01:01:04,440 --> 01:01:07,150
Have a lovely time, okay?

838
01:01:07,280 --> 01:01:09,280
And you, too!

839
01:01:09,910 --> 01:01:11,490
Bye.

840
01:01:14,040 --> 01:01:17,410
Don't let me catch you
hugging any guys like that.

841
01:01:17,580 --> 01:01:19,420
I won't.

842
01:01:19,580 --> 01:01:20,790
Better not.

843
01:01:20,960 --> 01:01:23,170
I won't.

844
01:01:30,680 --> 01:01:33,560
Do you really have to be home so early?

845
01:01:33,680 --> 01:01:35,680
Yeah, I promised.

846
01:01:36,390 --> 01:01:37,980
Okay.

847
01:01:39,100 --> 01:01:41,690
- Sorry.
- That's all right.

848
01:01:43,110 --> 01:01:47,530
Some of the kids are going
over to Nolston's after the prom.

849
01:01:47,650 --> 01:01:49,320
That's okay.

850
01:01:49,450 --> 01:01:50,950
What?

851
01:01:51,070 --> 01:01:54,280
If you wanna go with your friends,
I don't wanna spoil anything.

852
01:01:54,450 --> 01:01:56,080
Would you let me finish?

853
01:01:56,200 --> 01:02:00,120
What I was gonna say is that,
if you'd like to,

854
01:02:00,250 --> 01:02:02,670
we could stop in at The Beehive.

855
01:02:03,080 --> 01:02:05,090
I've never been there.

856
01:02:05,210 --> 01:02:06,170
No?

857
01:02:06,300 --> 01:02:08,970
Good! Well, then, let's go!

858
01:02:09,130 --> 01:02:10,510
- Okay.
- Okay?

859
01:02:10,630 --> 01:02:12,800
For sure. Great.

860
01:02:16,260 --> 01:02:18,270
Are you ready to dance?

861
01:02:19,640 --> 01:02:21,640
Tommy, l...

862
01:02:21,770 --> 01:02:22,850
Come on.

863
01:02:22,980 --> 01:02:25,980
I don't know how. I can't, Tommy. I can't.

864
01:02:26,150 --> 01:02:28,570
Sure you can.

865
01:02:32,360 --> 01:02:35,120
I'm not sure

866
01:02:35,280 --> 01:02:38,200
but the more that it's real

867
01:02:38,330 --> 01:02:42,120
the more it's right.

868
01:02:42,290 --> 01:02:45,920
Ooh, one night...

869
01:02:46,040 --> 01:02:49,210
It's as though we've been lovers

870
01:02:49,340 --> 01:02:52,840
all of our lives.

871
01:02:52,970 --> 01:02:56,510
There must be a God.

872
01:02:56,680 --> 01:03:01,600
Could it be that he's heard me at last?

873
01:03:01,730 --> 01:03:05,560
Because you look at me

874
01:03:07,110 --> 01:03:08,690
as the one beautiful...

875
01:03:08,940 --> 01:03:12,700
Yeah, you can. Come on.
Give me your hand. Just put it there.

876
01:03:12,820 --> 01:03:15,990
- Like that?
- Yeah. Put this on your shoulder.

877
01:03:16,120 --> 01:03:17,330
That's right.

878
01:03:17,450 --> 01:03:20,410
Okay, just relax. All right?

879
01:03:21,660 --> 01:03:25,170
Okay. Just listen to the music.

880
01:03:25,330 --> 01:03:27,540
That's right.

881
01:03:27,710 --> 01:03:30,880
See, you got it? That's good.

882
01:03:31,010 --> 01:03:34,050
You're as good as anyone else out here.

883
01:03:34,720 --> 01:03:36,300
Got it?

884
01:03:39,970 --> 01:03:42,140
- I'm sorry.
- That's all right.

885
01:03:42,270 --> 01:03:44,390
- It's just...
- That's all right.

886
01:03:44,520 --> 01:03:45,900
No harm...

887
01:03:46,060 --> 01:03:47,480
No foul.

888
01:03:47,650 --> 01:03:50,110
- I can't do anything.
- Yeah, you can.

889
01:03:50,230 --> 01:03:53,610
I can't dance. I can't even... I don't know.

890
01:04:16,510 --> 01:04:18,510
- Tommy?
- Yeah?

891
01:04:18,680 --> 01:04:20,720
Why...

892
01:04:20,850 --> 01:04:24,270
- Why what?
- Why am I here?

893
01:04:25,770 --> 01:04:27,900
Because it's the prom.

894
01:04:28,060 --> 01:04:30,320
Why am I here with you?

895
01:04:32,360 --> 01:04:34,780
Because I asked you.

896
01:04:36,200 --> 01:04:38,200
Why'd you ask me?

897
01:04:38,320 --> 01:04:40,330
Because I wanted to.

898
01:04:41,580 --> 01:04:44,080
Why'd you want to?

899
01:04:44,620 --> 01:04:47,080
Because you liked my poem.

900
01:04:48,290 --> 01:04:51,880
Only, I didn't write it. Somebody else did.

901
01:04:52,050 --> 01:04:53,630
Oh.

902
01:04:54,130 --> 01:04:56,630
Carrie, we're here

903
01:04:58,130 --> 01:05:00,260
and we're together

904
01:05:00,430 --> 01:05:02,180
and I like it.

905
01:05:02,810 --> 01:05:04,430
I do, I like it!

906
01:05:04,600 --> 01:05:07,440
Where there are other girls

907
01:05:07,560 --> 01:05:11,650
but tonight there's only me.

908
01:05:11,810 --> 01:05:16,320
I never dreamed someone like you

909
01:05:16,490 --> 01:05:21,950
could love someone like me.

910
01:05:45,520 --> 01:05:47,890
All right, ladies and gentlemen!

911
01:05:48,020 --> 01:05:49,350
Ladies and gentlemen...

912
01:05:49,520 --> 01:05:52,560
And you two behave yourselves, okay?

913
01:05:53,190 --> 01:05:58,190
Take your seats, please. We've gotta vote
for the king and the queen.

914
01:06:06,240 --> 01:06:07,660
Tommy,

915
01:06:07,790 --> 01:06:09,790
we are here.

916
01:06:09,910 --> 01:06:11,670
I know.

917
01:06:12,880 --> 01:06:15,040
Do you wanna decline?

918
01:06:15,170 --> 01:06:16,550
Do you?

919
01:06:17,840 --> 01:06:23,050
Hell, no. If you win, all they do is put you
up there for a school song and a dance.

920
01:06:23,180 --> 01:06:25,600
Then they take your picture
for the yearbook,

921
01:06:25,720 --> 01:06:28,890
so everyone can see
we look like a couple of idiots.

922
01:06:29,730 --> 01:06:32,400
Anyway, it's the last year. Why not?

923
01:06:32,520 --> 01:06:34,230
It's so beautiful!

924
01:06:38,690 --> 01:06:40,030
Hey...

925
01:06:40,150 --> 01:06:43,160
You're beautiful.

926
01:06:48,370 --> 01:06:53,330
Well, who should we vote for?
They're more your crowd than mine.

927
01:06:53,540 --> 01:06:55,540
I don't even have a crowd.

928
01:06:57,420 --> 01:06:58,960
Let's vote for ourselves.

929
01:07:00,380 --> 01:07:01,720
No.

930
01:07:01,880 --> 01:07:03,260
Why not?

931
01:07:03,380 --> 01:07:06,510
Please don't vote for ourselves.

932
01:07:08,720 --> 01:07:10,310
Carrie...

933
01:07:19,030 --> 01:07:22,450
Come on. To the devil with false modesty.

934
01:07:23,990 --> 01:07:25,660
The devil!

935
01:08:00,820 --> 01:08:02,820
Billy! Shh!

936
01:08:02,990 --> 01:08:05,410
Will you close that a little bit?

937
01:08:05,570 --> 01:08:07,910
Jesus, you wanna get caught?

938
01:08:08,070 --> 01:08:12,790
- That Carrie White, she sure is cute.
- Shut up.

939
01:08:12,910 --> 01:08:17,790
- Thought you said they were gonna win.
- They will. Won't even be close.

940
01:08:17,920 --> 01:08:20,300
I called in a few favours.

941
01:08:20,420 --> 01:08:22,550
Can I have your ballot, please?

942
01:08:27,680 --> 01:08:29,680
Hello, guys. Thank you.

943
01:08:30,720 --> 01:08:33,560
Can I have your ballots, please?

944
01:08:39,400 --> 01:08:41,230
- Thank you.
- Thanks, there.

945
01:08:41,400 --> 01:08:43,230
Thank you.

946
01:08:44,440 --> 01:08:46,400
Thank you, there.

947
01:08:46,530 --> 01:08:48,530
Ballots, please. Thank you.

948
01:08:48,660 --> 01:08:49,620
Thank you.

949
01:08:49,740 --> 01:08:51,490
Freddy, hurry up, please.

950
01:08:51,660 --> 01:08:54,040
Ballots...

951
01:08:54,200 --> 01:08:57,120
Good, good. Thanks a lot there, Vic.

952
01:08:59,210 --> 01:09:01,210
Get all of them?

953
01:09:04,170 --> 01:09:07,470
They're right in back of you,
so start kicking.

954
01:09:15,810 --> 01:09:18,730
- See you.
- Good luck.

955
01:09:19,940 --> 01:09:22,610
More ballots? Thank you.

956
01:09:22,730 --> 01:09:25,190
I have some more ballots for you.

957
01:09:25,320 --> 01:09:27,070
Thank you.

958
01:10:14,280 --> 01:10:17,160
Ladies and gentlemen,
I've got the winners.

959
01:10:17,330 --> 01:10:19,000
All right!

960
01:10:19,160 --> 01:10:22,130
I give you Tommy Ross and Carrie White!

961
01:16:45,340 --> 01:16:49,470
They're all gonna laugh at you!

962
01:16:49,600 --> 01:16:52,270
They're all gonna laugh at you!

963
01:16:52,520 --> 01:16:54,520
They're all gonna laugh at you!

964
01:16:54,640 --> 01:16:58,190
- Plug it up! Plug it up!
- They're all gonna laugh at you!

965
01:16:58,520 --> 01:17:01,020
- Plug it up! Plug it up!
- They're all gonna laugh at you!

966
01:17:01,150 --> 01:17:02,980
We're all sorry, Cassie.

967
01:17:03,150 --> 01:17:05,950
- They're all gonna laugh at you!
- We're all sorry, Cassie.

968
01:17:06,070 --> 01:17:08,570
Trust me, Carrie. You can trust me.

969
01:17:08,870 --> 01:17:11,910
Trust me, Carrie. You can trust me.

970
01:17:12,370 --> 01:17:15,410
Trust me, Carrie. You can trust me.

971
01:17:18,880 --> 01:17:21,210
Come on, let's go, Billy!

972
01:17:21,340 --> 01:17:24,090
- They're all gonna laugh at you!
- We're sorry, Cassie.

973
01:17:24,210 --> 01:17:25,970
They're all gonna laugh at you!

974
01:17:26,090 --> 01:17:27,090
We're sorry, Cassie.

975
01:17:27,220 --> 01:17:29,390
- Trust me, Carrie. You can trust me.
- They're all gonna laugh at you!

976
01:17:29,510 --> 01:17:31,350
We're sorry, Cassie.

977
01:17:31,430 --> 01:17:32,310
They're all gonna laugh at you!

978
01:17:32,430 --> 01:17:33,390
We're sorry, Cassie.

979
01:17:33,520 --> 01:17:34,350
Trust me, Carrie.

980
01:17:47,200 --> 01:17:49,410
Somebody open this door!

981
01:17:49,570 --> 01:17:50,910
Open this door now!

982
01:17:54,830 --> 01:17:56,830
Help! Help!

983
01:18:35,160 --> 01:18:36,700
Look at him!

984
01:19:01,850 --> 01:19:03,690
Have these students calm down!

985
01:19:05,860 --> 01:19:07,400
Mr Fromm! Mr Fromm!

986
01:19:34,640 --> 01:19:35,640
Carrie!

987
01:19:37,060 --> 01:19:38,350
Carrie...!

988
01:26:09,950 --> 01:26:11,740
Mama?

989
01:26:15,370 --> 01:26:17,580
Mama?

990
01:26:17,710 --> 01:26:21,040
Mama? Mama, it was bad, Mama.

991
01:26:21,210 --> 01:26:23,290
They laughed at me.

992
01:26:23,420 --> 01:26:25,960
Mama, hold me.

993
01:26:26,130 --> 01:26:29,090
Mama, please, hold me.

994
01:26:37,640 --> 01:26:38,600
Hold me, Mama.

995
01:26:38,730 --> 01:26:41,100
Please, hold me!

996
01:26:43,820 --> 01:26:47,030
I should have killed myself
when he put it in me.

997
01:26:48,530 --> 01:26:51,610
After the first time,
before we were married.

998
01:26:51,780 --> 01:26:54,240
Ralph promised never again.

999
01:26:55,990 --> 01:26:59,500
He promised, and I believed him.

1000
01:27:01,920 --> 01:27:03,920
But sin never dies.

1001
01:27:05,670 --> 01:27:07,670
Sin never dies.

1002
01:27:09,470 --> 01:27:11,470
At first it was all right.

1003
01:27:11,590 --> 01:27:13,930
We lived sinlessly.

1004
01:27:14,100 --> 01:27:17,600
We slept in the same bed,
but we never did it.

1005
01:27:19,180 --> 01:27:23,350
And then, that night,

1006
01:27:24,940 --> 01:27:28,190
I saw him looking down at me that way.

1007
01:27:32,320 --> 01:27:35,910
We got down on our knees
to pray for strength.

1008
01:27:37,450 --> 01:27:40,540
I smelled the whisky on his breath.

1009
01:27:42,420 --> 01:27:47,130
And he took me... He took me.

1010
01:27:48,670 --> 01:27:53,260
With the stink of the filthy
roadhouse whisky on his breath.

1011
01:27:53,340 --> 01:27:55,550
And I liked it.

1012
01:27:55,680 --> 01:27:57,890
I liked it!

1013
01:27:59,640 --> 01:28:05,190
Well, all that dirty touching in his hands
and coming all over me...

1014
01:28:05,310 --> 01:28:09,280
I should have given you to God
when you were born.

1015
01:28:09,440 --> 01:28:12,900
But I was weak and backsliding.

1016
01:28:16,320 --> 01:28:19,870
But now the devil has come home.

1017
01:28:19,990 --> 01:28:21,540
Oh!

1018
01:28:23,750 --> 01:28:24,960
We'll pray.

1019
01:28:25,120 --> 01:28:26,960
Yes.

1020
01:28:27,130 --> 01:28:29,130
We'll pray.

1021
01:28:30,380 --> 01:28:32,380
We'll pray.

1022
01:28:32,800 --> 01:28:34,800
We'll pray.

1023
01:28:34,930 --> 01:28:36,430
For the last time,

1024
01:28:37,140 --> 01:28:38,760
we'll pray.

1025
01:28:44,730 --> 01:28:47,860
Our Father, who art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name.

1026
01:28:48,820 --> 01:28:50,730
Thy kingdom come, thy will be done...

1027
01:29:42,200 --> 01:29:43,240
Aghh!

1028
01:29:49,290 --> 01:29:49,960
Ohh!

1029
01:29:51,540 --> 01:29:52,130
Aghh!

1030
01:29:52,960 --> 01:29:54,260
Aaghhh...!

1031
01:34:12,600 --> 01:34:14,600
Hello?

1032
01:34:14,850 --> 01:34:17,390
Oh, Betty, thank God it's you.

1033
01:34:17,560 --> 01:34:21,900
I don't think I could have handled
one more reporter.

1034
01:34:22,070 --> 01:34:26,280
Yeah, well, we're all a little edgy.

1035
01:34:28,070 --> 01:34:32,080
She's better. Well, uh,
sleeping too much, I guess,

1036
01:34:32,200 --> 01:34:38,370
but Dr Schnieder said that's to be
expected after all she's been through.

1037
01:34:38,540 --> 01:34:44,050
Well, he said that she's young enough,
so that she'll forget about it in time.

1038
01:34:44,210 --> 01:34:50,130
No. I wouldn't let her go to the funerals,
with Tommy and all the others gone.

1039
01:34:50,300 --> 01:34:53,390
It's best we just go away for a while.

1040
01:36:25,520 --> 01:36:27,360
It's all right!

1041
01:36:33,780 --> 01:36:37,450
It's all right. I know. It's all right.

1042
01:36:38,660 --> 01:36:40,580
It's all right. I'm here.
