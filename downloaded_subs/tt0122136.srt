RAJOMON GATE

15
00:10:20,947 --> 00:10:22,083
Who are you?

16
00:10:24,312 --> 00:10:28,014
A wandering spectre
out so late at night?

17
00:10:28,897 --> 00:10:31,925
No, no, I am no such thing

18
00:10:33,019 --> 00:10:37,477
I am returning from Nobleman
Fujiwara's mansion...

19
00:10:38,655 --> 00:10:40,969
...but I am afraid...

20
00:10:41,852 --> 00:10:44,082
...of the bamboo grove ahead

21
00:10:47,825 --> 00:10:52,788
It is dangerous at night with
highwaymen and robbers

22
00:10:55,691 --> 00:10:57,332
Please help me

23
00:10:58,804 --> 00:11:03,178
Will you see me to
the end of the grove?

24
00:11:03,515 --> 00:11:06,712
What if I were a robber?

25
00:11:07,510 --> 00:11:11,717
A fine samurai could
not be a robber

26
00:11:12,348 --> 00:11:15,923
Are you one of
the distinguished Raiko's...

27
00:11:16,218 --> 00:11:19,709
...renowned warriors?

28
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:23,536
Please help me

29
00:11:25,472 --> 00:11:26,439
Very well

30
00:11:26,691 --> 00:11:32,075
It's out of my way and late already,
but a little delay won't matter

31
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,641
Thank you

32
00:12:24,359 --> 00:12:25,579
Woman

33
00:12:26,798 --> 00:12:28,860
You're very fast

34
00:12:29,827 --> 00:12:32,435
It is a familiar road

35
00:12:37,399 --> 00:12:39,418
A cat?

36
00:12:49,850 --> 00:12:51,447
What is it?

37
00:12:52,373 --> 00:12:55,822
There you are. I wondered
where you'd gone

38
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:58,641
I heard a cat

39
00:13:00,869 --> 00:13:02,846
Nothing to be afraid of

40
00:13:03,225 --> 00:13:05,160
My heart is pounding

41
00:13:05,413 --> 00:13:07,011
They are starving too

42
00:13:07,473 --> 00:13:11,259
At the Kamo River bed...

43
00:13:11,596 --> 00:13:14,708
...crows peck at the bodies
of those who starved to death

44
00:13:28,378 --> 00:13:29,935
Thank you

45
00:13:31,071 --> 00:13:34,520
It's a secluded place

46
00:13:34,898 --> 00:13:37,086
We have nothing to offer you...

47
00:13:37,590 --> 00:13:41,502
...but I would be happy
if you came inside

48
00:13:43,941 --> 00:13:45,540
Well , let me see...

49
00:13:46,045 --> 00:13:49,789
Mother and I live alone

50
00:13:50,504 --> 00:13:54,079
Shall I accept
your kindness, then?

51
00:13:54,962 --> 00:13:56,140
Please do

52
00:14:00,725 --> 00:14:02,365
This way, please

53
00:14:20,452 --> 00:14:22,302
A fine residence

54
00:14:28,318 --> 00:14:30,421
Much better than my home

55
00:14:33,155 --> 00:14:35,342
Like a nobleman's abode

56
00:14:39,927 --> 00:14:41,568
Is anything wrong?

57
00:14:43,923 --> 00:14:45,942
It seems cold

58
00:14:46,951 --> 00:14:50,359
We only use it...

59
00:14:51,537 --> 00:14:54,060
...when we have guests

60
00:14:56,331 --> 00:14:58,855
I think your being here...

61
00:14:59,697 --> 00:15:02,136
...will soon fill the room
with warmth

62
00:15:04,113 --> 00:15:08,025
Strange things happen
in a war-torn land

63
00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:10,464
Hail fell in Summer

64
00:15:10,717 --> 00:15:14,671
Then it became so hot,
birds fell from the sky

65
00:15:49,414 --> 00:15:50,929
My mother

66
00:15:54,294 --> 00:16:00,098
Thank you for being
so kind to my daughter

67
00:16:05,609 --> 00:16:10,993
Not at all , I enjoyed the night breeze
while I saw her home

68
00:16:13,979 --> 00:16:18,060
I have a feeling we've
met somewhere

69
00:16:20,162 --> 00:16:21,971
You're joking!

70
00:16:22,939 --> 00:16:24,284
Isn't he, Mother?

71
00:16:28,322 --> 00:16:32,487
I believe we have but
I cannot recall where

72
00:16:32,739 --> 00:16:34,758
Serve him sake

73
00:17:14,255 --> 00:17:15,474
A cat?

74
00:17:15,896 --> 00:17:18,167
A homeless stray cat

75
00:17:18,419 --> 00:17:20,733
Please have some more

76
00:17:21,953 --> 00:17:27,210
Excuse me, but
how old are you?

77
00:17:29,313 --> 00:17:30,450
What?

78
00:17:31,122 --> 00:17:33,982
I also have a son

79
00:17:35,118 --> 00:17:39,282
He is about your age

80
00:17:42,101 --> 00:17:43,279
I am twenty-two

81
00:17:44,961 --> 00:17:47,022
My husband is twenty-one

82
00:17:50,429 --> 00:17:53,878
Where is he?
Serving the Emperor?

83
00:17:54,972 --> 00:17:56,780
He went to war

84
00:17:57,159 --> 00:17:58,547
To war?

85
00:17:59,052 --> 00:18:03,763
Yes, three years ago.
He has not returned

86
00:18:05,151 --> 00:18:06,959
Who is his leader?

87
00:18:07,507 --> 00:18:11,671
We do not know

88
00:18:13,227 --> 00:18:16,171
We had planted
Spring seeds

89
00:18:16,339 --> 00:18:17,475
Seeds?

90
00:18:18,232 --> 00:18:19,326
Yes

91
00:18:20,336 --> 00:18:25,888
We must plant seeds in an age
of war to keep from starving

92
00:18:27,781 --> 00:18:30,641
Suddenly , soldiers passed by

93
00:18:31,650 --> 00:18:35,479
My son was taken,
plough still in his hands

94
00:18:37,287 --> 00:18:39,011
Do not worry

95
00:18:39,306 --> 00:18:42,840
He'll be a successful samurai
somewhere by now

96
00:18:44,396 --> 00:18:45,952
Somewhere?

97
00:18:48,223 --> 00:18:53,102
Far away to the north in Ezo
or south in Tsukushi

98
00:18:54,448 --> 00:18:57,182
The whole land is up in arms

99
00:18:57,519 --> 00:19:02,567
He must be so great
he has no time to come home

100
00:19:03,534 --> 00:19:07,235
Don't worry. He was
lucky to be taken to war

101
00:19:08,203 --> 00:19:10,684
It's a samurai's world now!

102
00:19:12,662 --> 00:19:15,396
Noblemen cannot fight

103
00:19:16,111 --> 00:19:18,929
So the samurai will
rule the land

104
00:19:20,317 --> 00:19:26,416
The time will come when even
the Mikado must yield to our leader

105
00:19:27,678 --> 00:19:31,422
I used to be a farmer, too

106
00:19:32,726 --> 00:19:36,848
But since the war,
I've risen to this

107
00:19:40,128 --> 00:19:41,643
Do not worry

108
00:19:42,064 --> 00:19:46,185
Wars keep us in food
and everything else

109
00:19:46,606 --> 00:19:49,929
Everything is ours
for the taking

110
00:19:54,767 --> 00:19:55,944
Your mother?

111
00:19:57,501 --> 00:20:00,235
She is being tactful

112
00:20:36,072 --> 00:20:40,783
I am drunk. It is
very good sake

113
00:20:41,414 --> 00:20:44,905
Please make yourself
at home

114
00:25:04,558 --> 00:25:06,745
I am glad you came

115
00:25:11,624 --> 00:25:13,896
It's good sake

116
00:25:16,083 --> 00:25:18,355
Please feel at home

117
00:28:15,617 --> 00:28:16,404
Excuse me

118
00:29:25,111 --> 00:29:27,964
RAJOMON GATE

119
00:29:30,188 --> 00:29:32,747
An official is coming!

120
00:30:13,614 --> 00:30:20,075
You are Raito Minamoto,
the leader of the samurai

121
00:30:21,292 --> 00:30:25,278
It is not like you at all

122
00:30:28,928 --> 00:30:36,984
Are you doing nothing about the spectre
that appears at Rajomon Gate?

123
00:30:39,249 --> 00:30:46,592
Samurai
means men who are
proud of being strong warriors

124
00:30:50,326 --> 00:30:57,417
The spectre may well appear
at any time in the Palace

125
00:30:59,095 --> 00:31:03,921
I cannot sleep
peacefully at night

126
00:31:19,907 --> 00:31:21,753
He told me in
his august voice:

127
00:31:22,885 --> 00:31:25,990
I cannot sleep
peacefully at night"

128
00:31:28,465 --> 00:31:31,151
Who's running all
over the land fighting?

129
00:31:33,332 --> 00:31:35,095
It's me, Raiko Minamoto!

130
00:31:36,689 --> 00:31:39,584
In the Palace, they kick
balls, play games

131
00:31:40,340 --> 00:31:42,816
They write songs
and love women

132
00:31:45,416 --> 00:31:47,430
Don't say I said this

133
00:31:51,123 --> 00:31:52,927
It's frustrating

134
00:31:54,438 --> 00:31:57,206
The monster's not
a supernatural being

135
00:31:58,213 --> 00:32:00,814
Just an animal or
night-prowler!

136
00:32:02,115 --> 00:32:03,375
Call Kintoki!

137
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:06,773
He went west
with his troops

138
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:10,633
Call Tsuna Watanabe!

139
00:32:10,969 --> 00:32:13,528
He took his troops east

140
00:32:13,779 --> 00:32:15,878
Fool! I know that!

141
00:32:17,346 --> 00:32:19,989
I'm just trying to
stiffen your morale !

142
00:32:21,290 --> 00:32:23,755
Is there anyone who will
kill the monster?

143
00:32:23,790 --> 00:32:27,334
EZO, NORTHERN JAPAN

144
00:35:55,469 --> 00:35:57,783
You cut off
Kumasunehiko's head?

145
00:35:58,708 --> 00:35:59,803
Let me see it

146
00:36:16,465 --> 00:36:18,569
Is it really his head?

147
00:36:19,789 --> 00:36:21,851
He told me so himself !

148
00:36:22,145 --> 00:36:25,595
He wore fine armour
and had an iron club

149
00:36:26,605 --> 00:36:32,412
Good! It's really Kumasunehiko's
head. It's a great prize

150
00:36:34,137 --> 00:36:36,240
General Takemaro Fujiwara?

151
00:36:37,124 --> 00:36:38,471
He died in battle !

152
00:36:38,892 --> 00:36:41,037
My army of two
thousand men?

153
00:36:41,374 --> 00:36:43,856
They all died.
The enemy too!

154
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:47,096
Give me a detailed
account of it!

155
00:36:47,769 --> 00:36:51,304
It was all muddy.
Rushes grew there

156
00:36:51,977 --> 00:36:54,880
The enemy lured us
into the rushes!

157
00:36:55,638 --> 00:37:01,823
The battle began at dawn
and ended at night!

158
00:37:03,337 --> 00:37:08,134
He and I were alone by then

159
00:37:09,144 --> 00:37:14,025
He was hairy all over like
a bear! I was frightened!

160
00:37:15,161 --> 00:37:16,970
Kumasunehiko, I thought!

161
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:19,074
I was right! He told me so!

162
00:37:19,874 --> 00:37:23,324
He asked my name.
I was going to say "Gintoki"...

163
00:37:23,828 --> 00:37:30,308
Too simple , so I tacked on Yabu
and said I was Yabu-no-Gintoki

164
00:37:30,897 --> 00:37:34,137
He said my name
sounded strong

165
00:37:34,601 --> 00:37:39,355
Asking me if I were a general
he challenged me to a fight

166
00:37:40,112 --> 00:37:45,372
Was he strong! Like Atlas
given an iron club!

167
00:37:46,255 --> 00:37:49,579
I thought his club
would kill me!

168
00:37:50,252 --> 00:37:53,450
I didn't want to die,
so I fought!

169
00:37:54,249 --> 00:37:56,606
I finally cut off his head!

170
00:38:01,992 --> 00:38:05,484
I will call you
Yabu-no-Gintoki

171
00:38:06,915 --> 00:38:11,418
I will add you to my big "Four".
My big "Five" now

172
00:39:51,693 --> 00:39:53,333
Jimbei, it's me!

173
00:39:59,009 --> 00:40:00,818
I'm Hachi, Yone's son

174
00:40:02,079 --> 00:40:03,467
You're...

175
00:40:03,846 --> 00:40:08,303
What happened? My home's burned!
My home's gone!

176
00:40:08,555 --> 00:40:10,993
Yes, you're Hachi all right

177
00:40:11,751 --> 00:40:13,432
Your clothes?

178
00:40:13,685 --> 00:40:14,989
Never mind that!

179
00:40:15,451 --> 00:40:19,614
What about my home?
My mother and wife?

180
00:40:21,464 --> 00:40:27,099
It was last Summer.
Kyoto burned for three days and nights

181
00:40:27,981 --> 00:40:31,977
Conquerors and conquered
alike burned things

182
00:40:32,649 --> 00:40:34,919
Fires everywhere in war

183
00:40:35,551 --> 00:40:38,494
Sparks fell even here

184
00:40:39,293 --> 00:40:42,615
We fled into the mountains

185
00:40:43,246 --> 00:40:49,889
When we came back your home
had burned. It was just ashes

186
00:40:50,940 --> 00:40:56,491
Did your mother and wife
burn to death or run away...?

187
00:40:56,953 --> 00:40:59,771
We haven't seen them since

188
00:41:00,822 --> 00:41:03,639
We don't know how
the house burned down

189
00:41:32,569 --> 00:41:38,162
Mother! Oshigi!
Where did you go?

190
00:41:51,282 --> 00:41:53,132
You've won great distinction

191
00:41:54,982 --> 00:41:57,715
Your valour is known
all over the capital

192
00:41:58,766 --> 00:42:02,803
Even beggars say
you're a strong samurai

193
00:42:04,863 --> 00:42:10,540
Yes, young girls especially
make much of him

194
00:42:11,507 --> 00:42:13,736
They hope for
a glimpse of him

195
00:42:14,997 --> 00:42:19,791
The bravest man in the capital
must act accordingly

196
00:42:21,515 --> 00:42:22,692
My orders:

197
00:42:23,659 --> 00:42:29,925
Get rid of the monster that
kills samurai by biting necks

198
00:42:31,438 --> 00:42:35,264
Do not fail since it will
affect my prestige

199
00:42:36,526 --> 00:42:38,965
I offer you my cup

200
00:42:40,100 --> 00:42:41,404
Pour for him

201
00:42:57,677 --> 00:43:00,200
How about women, Gintoki?

202
00:43:01,966 --> 00:43:03,732
Do you think
they're beautiful

203
00:43:06,633 --> 00:43:08,021
Yes, I do

204
00:43:08,021 --> 00:43:09,198
Very well

205
00:43:09,703 --> 00:43:12,309
When you have killed the monster,
I will give you a woman

206
00:43:13,235 --> 00:43:18,382
Any you want...so don't fail

207
00:44:21,585 --> 00:44:23,439
What is the matter?

208
00:44:26,895 --> 00:44:28,707
Afraid to walk
alone at night?

209
00:44:38,443 --> 00:44:42,151
Are you passing through
the dark grove beyond here?

210
00:44:45,271 --> 00:44:47,841
So am I.
I will see you home

211
00:44:49,907 --> 00:44:51,340
Thank you

212
00:45:53,124 --> 00:45:54,852
Thank you

213
00:45:55,231 --> 00:45:56,959
This is your home?

214
00:45:57,718 --> 00:45:58,941
Yes

215
00:46:00,036 --> 00:46:02,523
I live with my mother

216
00:46:03,408 --> 00:46:07,117
My home's far away yet.
May I rest a bit?

217
00:46:14,197 --> 00:46:16,305
Will you let me rest?

218
00:46:36,871 --> 00:46:38,389
Welcome

219
00:46:46,481 --> 00:46:48,799
It was nice of you to come

220
00:46:50,737 --> 00:46:51,960
Please

221
00:47:32,756 --> 00:47:36,970
Are your names Yone and
Shige, by any chance?

222
00:47:42,913 --> 00:47:44,683
Excuse me if I were rude

223
00:47:45,779 --> 00:47:51,385
You look exactly like my mother
and wife but are dressed differently

224
00:47:52,775 --> 00:47:55,979
Where are they?

225
00:47:57,622 --> 00:48:02,005
Three years ago, I was taken
east by the army to fight

226
00:48:03,269 --> 00:48:05,461
I was working in the fields

227
00:48:06,725 --> 00:48:08,074
I left my mother and wife

228
00:48:14,059 --> 00:48:19,791
I wanted to return to my mother
and wife, so I fought as hard as I could

229
00:48:23,879 --> 00:48:25,186
I could not die

230
00:48:26,365 --> 00:48:28,641
I made a name for
myself instead

231
00:48:29,020 --> 00:48:32,055
Leader Raiko named me
Yabu-no-Gintoki

232
00:48:36,101 --> 00:48:41,453
But when I went home,
my house was gone

233
00:48:42,802 --> 00:48:44,361
My mother and wife
were gone too

234
00:48:51,062 --> 00:48:52,453
It's very strange

235
00:48:54,350 --> 00:48:58,227
You two look exactly like
my mother and wife

236
00:49:00,334 --> 00:49:05,350
I do not know where they are

237
00:49:06,277 --> 00:49:11,503
But just as you fought day and night
in order to see them...

238
00:49:12,683 --> 00:49:19,721
...your mother and wife must have
waited for you too, day and night

239
00:49:24,357 --> 00:49:29,794
You have returned a fine man

240
00:49:32,197 --> 00:49:34,641
I wonder what has
happened to them

241
00:49:36,833 --> 00:49:40,667
My home was at the edge
of a bamboo grove

242
00:49:42,733 --> 00:49:44,334
About here

243
00:49:46,653 --> 00:49:48,296
How long have you lived here?

244
00:49:51,668 --> 00:49:53,774
For three years

245
00:49:54,069 --> 00:49:55,630
After I left for war?

246
00:49:57,020 --> 00:50:00,055
Yes, I think so.

247
00:50:01,825 --> 00:50:07,093
Is there a reason you are living
in such a lonely place?

248
00:50:09,116 --> 00:50:16,155
A poor mother and daughter,
we live quietly and inconspicuously

249
00:50:17,250 --> 00:50:20,832
If you came three years ago,
did you see my house?

250
00:50:27,238 --> 00:50:29,093
If not, the charred ruins?

251
00:50:40,008 --> 00:50:41,314
Who are you?

252
00:50:44,813 --> 00:50:46,921
Reveal your true selves!

253
00:51:11,069 --> 00:51:12,461
Monsters!

254
00:51:12,797 --> 00:51:16,663
Why have you taken the image
of my mother and wife?

255
00:51:23,542 --> 00:51:26,629
RAJOMON GATE

256
00:52:09,154 --> 00:52:10,286
Woman!

257
00:52:14,187 --> 00:52:15,446
Are you here?

258
00:52:39,056 --> 00:52:42,034
Woman! Come out
if you are here!

259
00:52:45,305 --> 00:52:47,906
Where are you, woman?

260
00:52:51,764 --> 00:52:55,622
I did not come to kill you!
I came to see you!

261
00:53:15,669 --> 00:53:16,842
Woman!

262
00:53:20,701 --> 00:53:21,917
Are you here?

263
00:53:27,956 --> 00:53:29,173
Are you here?

264
00:54:02,849 --> 00:54:06,833
You must want to see him

265
00:54:09,727 --> 00:54:12,034
I want to see my son too

266
00:54:47,429 --> 00:54:52,504
Our vow is to kill samurai
and suck their blood

267
00:54:54,140 --> 00:54:57,117
So we invoked
the evil gods

268
00:55:00,724 --> 00:55:03,995
If only he were
not a samurai...

269
00:55:36,916 --> 00:55:38,552
I beg you...

270
00:55:40,230 --> 00:55:41,823
Bear it

271
00:55:43,585 --> 00:55:45,011
Endure it

272
00:55:45,975 --> 00:55:50,882
Be content to
see him...secretly

273
00:56:08,203 --> 00:56:09,503
It's him!

274
00:56:24,936 --> 00:56:26,068
Are you here?

275
00:56:27,410 --> 00:56:28,627
Are you here?

276
00:56:30,975 --> 00:56:32,192
Where are you?

277
00:56:35,798 --> 00:56:37,392
What has happened to you?

278
00:57:00,583 --> 00:57:01,716
You're here?

279
00:57:49,735 --> 00:57:51,707
It is nice of you to come

280
00:57:57,746 --> 00:57:59,633
We have nothing
to offer you

281
00:58:01,226 --> 00:58:05,881
But permit us to celebrate
your safe return home

282
00:58:09,237 --> 00:58:10,705
Serve him

283
00:58:57,004 --> 00:59:00,611
I will not ask you
who you are

284
00:59:04,134 --> 00:59:07,783
I just wanted to see you,
so I came

285
00:59:11,725 --> 00:59:13,444
You look like my mother

286
00:59:14,493 --> 00:59:16,128
You look like my wife

287
00:59:17,512 --> 00:59:20,532
This is enough for me

288
00:59:24,222 --> 00:59:28,080
I am glad to see you again.
I missed you

289
00:59:29,255 --> 00:59:33,029
We also wished to see you

290
00:59:35,798 --> 00:59:38,020
It will not be dawn
for a long time

291
00:59:40,243 --> 00:59:43,765
Please relax and
be comfortable

292
01:00:16,310 --> 01:00:17,568
I missed you

293
01:00:53,425 --> 01:00:54,851
You have a cat?

294
01:00:56,026 --> 01:01:00,177
No, it is a stray cat
without an owner

295
01:01:01,561 --> 01:01:07,391
That reminds me. When I was taken
to war we had a black kitten at home

296
01:01:13,765 --> 01:01:17,540
Never mind. I will forget
about my home

297
01:05:04,677 --> 01:05:05,852
Excuse me

298
01:05:12,227 --> 01:05:14,407
It will be dawn soon

299
01:05:15,372 --> 01:05:18,433
Please leave before then

300
01:05:48,419 --> 01:05:49,594
I will come again

301
01:05:52,026 --> 01:05:53,319
Will you wait?

302
01:06:27,481 --> 01:06:33,009
Returning empty-handed every
night...seen the monster?

303
01:06:33,301 --> 01:06:37,657
Yes, I saw it but...

304
01:06:39,123 --> 01:06:40,923
Why didn't you kill it?

305
01:06:41,803 --> 01:06:43,771
It's...

306
01:06:45,028 --> 01:06:46,201
You couldn't?

307
01:06:48,419 --> 01:06:49,467
No...

308
01:06:52,231 --> 01:06:54,074
You look bad

309
01:06:56,166 --> 01:06:58,512
You look like
a monster yourself

310
01:07:11,494 --> 01:07:13,756
Have you been bewitched
by the monster?

311
01:08:20,634 --> 01:08:26,371
Your breast, your legs
are like Shige's

312
01:08:27,460 --> 01:08:28,758
You are Shige

313
01:08:29,470 --> 01:08:30,978
You are my wife

314
01:09:02,887 --> 01:09:06,908
Shige, you are
good enough to eat

315
01:09:07,746 --> 01:09:11,054
I'll chew you up and
make you part of me!

316
01:09:42,839 --> 01:09:44,011
Hold me tighter!

317
01:09:44,640 --> 01:09:48,408
More! More!

318
01:10:35,646 --> 01:10:36,819
There you are

319
01:10:39,373 --> 01:10:40,672
Where is she?

320
01:11:05,296 --> 01:11:07,640
She is not here anymore

321
01:11:08,101 --> 01:11:10,236
What? Not here?

322
01:11:13,755 --> 01:11:17,272
Why? What happened to her?

323
01:11:28,998 --> 01:11:36,620
She was permitted to see you
and love you for seven days

324
01:11:38,462 --> 01:11:40,012
Please count and see

325
01:11:41,896 --> 01:11:44,074
Last night was the seventh

326
01:11:52,492 --> 01:11:54,836
She shortened her life
to seven days...

327
01:11:56,553 --> 01:11:59,066
...to pledge her love to you

328
01:12:04,134 --> 01:12:07,065
Are you not living
human beings?

329
01:12:08,614 --> 01:12:13,974
So how could she shorten
her life for seven days?

330
01:12:16,655 --> 01:12:18,036
I know not what you are!

331
01:12:18,874 --> 01:12:25,030
Evil gods or ghosts- supernatural
powers can make you look human?

332
01:12:26,621 --> 01:12:30,474
So you could not die!

333
01:12:34,453 --> 01:12:35,751
She could not die!

334
01:12:44,293 --> 01:12:45,843
I want to see her once more

335
01:12:49,863 --> 01:12:54,218
Bound by a vow, I cannot
tell you who we are

336
01:12:57,485 --> 01:13:00,416
We promised the evil gods

337
01:13:08,499 --> 01:13:12,728
Gods of hate who wander
between this and the netherworld

338
01:13:14,320 --> 01:13:19,889
Promising revenge by sucking blood,
we took human forms

339
01:13:24,035 --> 01:13:26,463
She broke her promise

340
01:13:30,317 --> 01:13:31,699
Our love?

341
01:13:33,583 --> 01:13:34,671
Yes

342
01:13:37,311 --> 01:13:38,692
You are my mother!

343
01:13:48,702 --> 01:13:50,209
She's my wife!

344
01:13:55,945 --> 01:13:59,464
Tell me who killed you!

345
01:14:21,157 --> 01:14:23,125
We promised

346
01:14:24,632 --> 01:14:32,337
So we cannot reveal what we
are or why we became like this

347
01:14:33,384 --> 01:14:35,060
What did you promise?

348
01:14:37,488 --> 01:14:39,833
To suck the blood
of samurai

349
01:14:42,807 --> 01:14:47,748
To suck the blood
of all samurai

350
01:14:52,606 --> 01:14:54,197
You too, are one

351
01:14:55,873 --> 01:15:00,186
Instead of killing you...

352
01:15:01,400 --> 01:15:03,410
...she gave herself to you

353
01:15:06,425 --> 01:15:11,535
So she fell headlong
into hell

354
01:15:14,801 --> 01:15:16,350
She was glad to

355
01:15:43,823 --> 01:15:48,722
Can I not see her anymore?
Is she gone?

356
01:15:52,574 --> 01:15:56,595
Instead of sucking
hateful samurai blood...

357
01:15:58,019 --> 01:16:01,368
...she preferred to love
you and go to hell

358
01:16:03,964 --> 01:16:05,180
Hateful...?

359
01:16:09,325 --> 01:16:10,749
Tell me why!

360
01:16:13,596 --> 01:16:14,895
If only I could...

361
01:16:16,612 --> 01:16:20,632
Bound by a vow,
I cannot tell you

362
01:16:22,684 --> 01:16:24,108
Forgive me

363
01:16:28,924 --> 01:16:30,138
Mother!

364
01:16:35,540 --> 01:16:37,467
What happened to you?

365
01:17:02,510 --> 01:17:04,645
You saw the monster?

366
01:17:08,792 --> 01:17:12,727
If you saw it, I should
think you'd destroy it

367
01:17:14,779 --> 01:17:17,543
I'll take that up later

368
01:17:19,679 --> 01:17:23,490
Tell me what
the monster was like

369
01:17:24,118 --> 01:17:28,306
Vengeful ghosts
murdered by samurai

370
01:17:29,353 --> 01:17:34,672
So they hate samurai
and suck their blood

371
01:17:37,477 --> 01:17:39,236
The ghost told you that?

372
01:17:41,246 --> 01:17:42,335
Fool

373
01:17:45,099 --> 01:17:49,077
We fight so nobles and the masses
can live without worry!

374
01:17:50,668 --> 01:17:53,140
So how can anyone hate us?

375
01:17:54,312 --> 01:17:58,625
Nobles may benefit from it...

376
01:17:59,170 --> 01:18:03,734
...but the fleeing farmers
starve to death!

377
01:18:03,985 --> 01:18:05,368
They are weak!

378
01:18:06,289 --> 01:18:08,508
The weak always starve!

379
01:18:09,011 --> 01:18:13,576
We risk our lives to
fight -it needs courage!

380
01:18:14,120 --> 01:18:17,554
Isn't that why everyone
respects us?

381
01:18:17,848 --> 01:18:18,978
Take yourself !

382
01:18:20,066 --> 01:18:23,374
A farmers son once,
but Gintoki now!

383
01:18:24,589 --> 01:18:27,731
Who'd respect or think
a farmer to be a human being?

384
01:18:32,086 --> 01:18:35,016
A samurai, so women
make much of you!

385
01:18:36,818 --> 01:18:39,748
No ghost is going
to hate us!

386
01:18:40,586 --> 01:18:42,848
No ghosts can
make fools of us!

387
01:18:46,994 --> 01:18:49,506
With a samurai's authority
I order you...

388
01:18:50,679 --> 01:18:52,019
...destroy it!

389
01:18:54,280 --> 01:18:57,588
One has been destroyed

390
01:18:58,133 --> 01:19:01,735
What? One has
been destroyed?

391
01:19:04,121 --> 01:19:05,586
How many were there?

392
01:19:07,932 --> 01:19:09,188
Two

393
01:19:11,576 --> 01:19:13,083
You destroyed one?

394
01:19:20,663 --> 01:19:22,003
The proof?

395
01:19:27,154 --> 01:19:28,285
Well ?

396
01:19:30,128 --> 01:19:32,305
It will never appear again

397
01:19:33,603 --> 01:19:35,655
Tell me why

398
01:19:37,372 --> 01:19:38,712
It disappeared!

399
01:19:39,508 --> 01:19:45,161
There was nothing I could do!
It disappeared from my sight!

400
01:19:47,213 --> 01:19:48,595
One more left?

401
01:19:49,475 --> 01:19:50,060
Yes!

402
01:19:51,276 --> 01:19:52,532
Destroy it

403
01:19:54,249 --> 01:19:56,970
- Let someone else...!
- Fool

404
01:19:58,772 --> 01:20:00,908
If this one gets away...

405
01:20:02,876 --> 01:20:04,090
...I will kill you

406
01:20:07,021 --> 01:20:10,878
It is to uphold
my samurai honour!

407
01:21:23,137 --> 01:21:26,977
RAJOMON GATE

408
01:21:45,291 --> 01:21:47,822
Why did you
not go away?

409
01:21:51,156 --> 01:21:54,997
You sucked blood
every night? Why?

410
01:21:59,470 --> 01:22:01,116
Why can't you
rest in peace?

411
01:22:02,296 --> 01:22:04,154
I wished to see you

412
01:22:05,672 --> 01:22:09,133
I wished to see you
just once more

413
01:22:11,116 --> 01:22:14,408
I have lost my honour
and will be killed!

414
01:22:15,800 --> 01:22:21,960
I have been driven to the point
where I must destroy you or die!

415
01:22:23,818 --> 01:22:30,443
After seeing you, I was
ready to follow her to hell

416
01:22:31,625 --> 01:22:35,085
Satisfied now that
you have seen me?

417
01:22:36,434 --> 01:22:39,684
Please come
to my abode

418
01:22:40,739 --> 01:22:44,452
Will you read the sutra
to me there?

419
01:22:45,339 --> 01:22:47,575
Then I can rest in peace

420
01:22:50,782 --> 01:22:54,918
Please. I have an
edifying sutra

421
01:22:56,479 --> 01:23:01,838
If you read it, my deep-rooted
grudges will fade away

422
01:23:36,693 --> 01:23:40,280
A puddle . Please be careful

423
01:23:48,677 --> 01:23:50,239
What is it?

424
01:23:51,378 --> 01:23:52,771
It's nothing

425
01:24:12,772 --> 01:24:13,761
Something...?

426
01:24:57,255 --> 01:24:59,068
It was a black cat?

427
01:25:00,290 --> 01:25:01,597
I think so

428
01:25:07,878 --> 01:25:09,901
Didn't you just pick it up?

429
01:25:10,239 --> 01:25:13,653
Cat's legs aren't
just lying around!

430
01:25:14,749 --> 01:25:17,657
Don't be angry.
Just a thought

431
01:25:19,976 --> 01:25:23,096
Why would a cat
hate samurai?

432
01:25:28,912 --> 01:25:33,971
They said demons appeared on
Mount Oe so I went for the Mikado

433
01:25:35,531 --> 01:25:37,386
There are no demons

434
01:25:38,650 --> 01:25:41,263
It was Shutendoji,
a bandit

435
01:25:42,485 --> 01:25:46,912
No glory in killing a bandit,
so I said a demon

436
01:25:50,157 --> 01:25:56,227
Now, you've destroyed a cat as big
as a cow and one thousand years old

437
01:25:58,124 --> 01:26:01,033
To purify yourself,
pray for seven days

438
01:26:03,309 --> 01:26:06,893
It's important to make
it the talk of the capital

439
01:26:09,422 --> 01:26:13,511
Do it grandiosely .
Purification. Prayers

440
01:26:45,505 --> 01:26:46,559
Mother

441
01:26:52,797 --> 01:26:54,104
Are you a cat?

442
01:26:56,338 --> 01:26:58,025
Are you my mother?

443
01:27:01,060 --> 01:27:04,095
Return it to me

444
01:27:09,701 --> 01:27:13,495
Return it to me

445
01:27:17,709 --> 01:27:21,756
Return it to me

446
01:27:29,723 --> 01:27:36,510
Mother! Are you a cat
or a ghost?

447
01:27:38,997 --> 01:27:41,147
My mother couldn't be

448
01:27:42,538 --> 01:27:45,574
Mother! Please come out!

449
01:27:46,838 --> 01:27:49,199
If you are my mother,
please come out!

450
01:27:50,716 --> 01:27:53,962
The sword that protects you...

451
01:27:54,763 --> 01:27:58,683
...is in the way

452
01:28:00,664 --> 01:28:05,217
Mother, please rest in peace!

453
01:28:07,830 --> 01:28:15,039
I cut off your arm, thinking an
apparition had taken your form!

454
01:28:16,640 --> 01:28:19,928
Take the sword away

455
01:28:21,277 --> 01:28:26,251
Return my arm to me

456
01:28:27,474 --> 01:28:30,002
What will you do then?

457
01:28:31,731 --> 01:28:35,272
My arm is my weapon

458
01:28:37,042 --> 01:28:45,558
Without it, I cannot suck
the blood of samurai

459
01:28:48,129 --> 01:28:57,866
Will you wander forever
as a vengeful ghost, Mother?

460
01:28:59,763 --> 01:29:04,316
Yes, I will

461
01:29:05,833 --> 01:29:09,543
For the hate I bear
the samurai

462
01:29:11,439 --> 01:29:16,161
For warring samurai

463
01:29:58,356 --> 01:29:59,368
Excuse me...

464
01:30:03,456 --> 01:30:04,467
Excuse me...

465
01:30:09,484 --> 01:30:10,622
Who is it?

466
01:30:11,803 --> 01:30:13,826
Please open the door

467
01:30:16,397 --> 01:30:20,065
Tonight ends the seventh
day of solitary purification

468
01:30:21,329 --> 01:30:23,100
I cannot open
it until dawn

469
01:30:24,533 --> 01:30:27,020
I know that very well

470
01:30:28,790 --> 01:30:35,830
I am a medium in charge of
divination at the Imperial Palace

471
01:30:37,938 --> 01:30:41,015
I cannot break the
rules for anyone

472
01:30:42,785 --> 01:30:47,212
The Mikado is very
troubled about you

473
01:30:48,518 --> 01:30:51,849
Tonight is the last night

474
01:30:52,396 --> 01:30:56,696
So evil spirits may appear
to thwart your plans

475
01:30:58,382 --> 01:31:01,965
The Mikado sent me here...

476
01:31:02,597 --> 01:31:09,005
I am to seal them in so that you
may complete your seven day duty

477
01:31:11,745 --> 01:31:13,473
Inform the Mikado...

478
01:31:14,527 --> 01:31:15,918
...that I am a match for
any evil spirit!

479
01:31:16,339 --> 01:31:18,025
You do not understand at all

480
01:31:19,543 --> 01:31:22,704
Disobey him...

481
01:31:24,095 --> 01:31:28,648
...and not only you
but your leader...

482
01:31:29,702 --> 01:31:35,814
...will be punished too

483
01:31:40,155 --> 01:31:43,190
It will only take a little while

484
01:31:44,245 --> 01:31:46,184
Please open the door

485
01:31:48,291 --> 01:31:50,694
Just a little while then

486
01:32:30,571 --> 01:32:34,871
Excuse me for calling
so late at night

487
01:32:41,531 --> 01:32:45,999
Is that the arm you
cut off the ghost?

488
01:32:49,287 --> 01:32:52,153
Please divine or
purify the room

489
01:32:52,448 --> 01:32:56,200
No, no, I cannot
go near it

490
01:32:57,718 --> 01:33:01,596
You offered it to
your god there

491
01:33:04,210 --> 01:33:06,865
I divine by the positive...

492
01:33:08,383 --> 01:33:12,598
...and negative principles

493
01:33:15,169 --> 01:33:19,806
Please show me
the arm more closely

494
01:33:21,028 --> 01:33:28,110
Please be so good as to
bring the arm to me

495
01:33:34,054 --> 01:33:35,572
Very troublesome

496
01:34:12,371 --> 01:34:15,021
May I take it in my hand?

497
01:34:17,659 --> 01:34:18,679
Please do

498
01:34:37,344 --> 01:34:38,748
Your left arm?

499
01:34:42,234 --> 01:34:43,552
I have it back!

500
01:35:45,393 --> 01:35:46,627
Mother!

501
01:36:09,287 --> 01:36:10,351
Spectre!

502
01:37:51,582 --> 01:37:53,539
Mother!

503
01:37:59,618 --> 01:38:01,957
Mother!

504
01:39:33,601 --> 01:43:29,379
THE END
