1
00:00:53,556 --> 00:00:55,363
'Tis the night...

2
00:00:55,453 --> 00:00:59,602
...the night of the grave's delight.

3
00:02:01,223 --> 00:02:02,955
Gotcha.

4
00:02:03,675 --> 00:02:05,550
Get up.

5
00:02:05,630 --> 00:02:09,476
Hey. They're not your mates.
Your mates are over here.

6
00:02:09,556 --> 00:02:11,155
Go on. Go.

7
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:21,289
You think I give a shit, Corey?

8
00:02:42,723 --> 00:02:45,722
- Ready for the money shot?
- Yeah, man.

9
00:03:03,922 --> 00:03:07,968
The fuck? Are you blind? Faggot!

10
00:03:08,423 --> 00:03:13,222
How many times have I got to
tell you you are not welcome here?

11
00:03:13,872 --> 00:03:16,088
Are you fucking mute as well?

12
00:03:20,755 --> 00:03:22,976
Get the fuck up. Go. Go!

13
00:03:23,056 --> 00:03:25,122
Yeah, run, you little fag!

14
00:03:28,256 --> 00:03:30,343
Fuckin' freak gives me the creeps.

15
00:03:33,489 --> 00:03:35,288
What a dickhead.

16
00:04:04,122 --> 00:04:05,842
- Mr. M.
- Boys.

17
00:04:05,922 --> 00:04:07,788
How you going?

18
00:04:08,122 --> 00:04:09,988
Mr. M.

19
00:04:10,988 --> 00:04:14,776
I've been trying all afternoon
to get this damn printer to work.

20
00:04:14,856 --> 00:04:17,721
Have you tried... plugging it in?

21
00:04:21,922 --> 00:04:25,404
- It's fixed.
- What? What did you do?

22
00:04:25,484 --> 00:04:26,810
Show me what you did.

23
00:04:26,890 --> 00:04:28,809
Mr. M.

24
00:04:28,889 --> 00:04:32,909
No pop-tarts. I guess you
didn't know I was coming over?

25
00:04:32,989 --> 00:04:35,009
So, how was your final day?

26
00:04:35,089 --> 00:04:37,243
Must be a bit sad leaving school behind.

27
00:04:37,323 --> 00:04:40,010
- That's not the word I'd use.
- You home for dinner?

28
00:04:40,090 --> 00:04:42,942
I'm sure you can microwave
your lean cuisine on your own.

29
00:04:43,022 --> 00:04:45,544
Having dinner together
isn't just about eating.

30
00:04:45,624 --> 00:04:48,655
- It's about...
- Spending quality time together.

31
00:04:51,490 --> 00:04:53,909
Wait. What'd...
what'd you want to talk about?

32
00:04:53,989 --> 00:04:56,776
Oh, well... what are you doing tonight?

33
00:04:56,856 --> 00:05:00,476
- Skating. Trick or treating.
- Thought you hated Halloween.

34
00:05:00,556 --> 00:05:04,009
- Shouldn't you be studying?
- Well, exams don't start till next week.

35
00:05:04,089 --> 00:05:07,562
Every grade counts if you're gonna
get a scholarship to New York.

36
00:05:12,856 --> 00:05:16,921
- Have you been in my room again?
- This came in the mail today.

37
00:05:20,056 --> 00:05:22,642
They're on the other side of the world, mate.

38
00:05:22,722 --> 00:05:25,909
I thought you were going
to study here, like your old man.

39
00:05:25,989 --> 00:05:28,055
You might have thought that.

40
00:05:28,822 --> 00:05:31,490
Photography's a fun hobby.

41
00:05:31,570 --> 00:05:35,688
- But it's hardly gonna pay the bills, is it?
- Can we talk about this another time?

42
00:05:35,822 --> 00:05:38,821
Maybe, I don't know, my 18th?

43
00:05:45,922 --> 00:05:47,455
Corey?

44
00:05:50,755 --> 00:05:52,043
Yep?

45
00:05:52,123 --> 00:05:54,642
I thought we might go away for the weekend.

46
00:05:54,722 --> 00:05:57,788
Up to the lake for a bit of fishing.
What do you say?

47
00:05:58,289 --> 00:06:01,842
It just sounds like great fun.
Don't you think?

48
00:06:01,922 --> 00:06:03,788
I think I have to study.

49
00:06:20,957 --> 00:06:23,376
Man, kill me if I ever end up like him.

50
00:06:23,456 --> 00:06:25,255
<i>Amigo,</i> it's a promise.

51
00:06:25,689 --> 00:06:28,183
- Is that a whole bottle of vodka?
- Yeah. Here you are.

52
00:06:28,263 --> 00:06:31,921
- He's gonna notice that's gone.
- So? What's he gonna do?

53
00:06:32,222 --> 00:06:34,772
Bore you to death? The guy's a numbnut.

54
00:06:36,490 --> 00:06:38,955
Off the bed, dickheads. What the hell?

55
00:06:42,922 --> 00:06:45,155
What's the plan for tonight?

56
00:06:47,456 --> 00:06:50,109
A little trick. A little treat.

57
00:06:50,189 --> 00:06:52,456
Then a whole lot of tits at the tower.

58
00:06:53,523 --> 00:06:56,323
So we're finishing high school
the way we spent it.

59
00:06:59,889 --> 00:07:03,875
What's the matter, New York? Too good for it?

60
00:07:03,955 --> 00:07:05,989
What is this shit?

61
00:07:07,855 --> 00:07:09,775
You actually pissed about that?

62
00:07:09,855 --> 00:07:12,642
Well, I thought we were
all going to Box Hill.

63
00:07:12,722 --> 00:07:14,775
The world is bigger than that.

64
00:07:14,855 --> 00:07:17,446
So, what, you're just gonna ditch... us?

65
00:07:17,525 --> 00:07:21,049
Well, come on. It's not like we can hang out
at the tower forever, smoking billies.

66
00:07:21,129 --> 00:07:23,143
What the hell is wrong with that?

67
00:07:24,222 --> 00:07:26,256
Yo, Dave Grohl!

68
00:07:26,555 --> 00:07:28,373
Shut the fuck up.

69
00:07:35,655 --> 00:07:37,403
It was just an idea.

70
00:07:38,489 --> 00:07:40,477
If it means that much to you...

71
00:07:40,556 --> 00:07:42,989
...don't get your panties in a twist.

72
00:07:44,422 --> 00:07:46,856
My panties are fine, fuck knuckle.

73
00:07:48,256 --> 00:07:50,686
I don't like it when Mum and Dad fight.

74
00:07:58,189 --> 00:08:01,223
- Hi.
- You're letting light in.

75
00:08:10,389 --> 00:08:13,256
- Want a hand?
- I don't need your help.

76
00:08:16,189 --> 00:08:19,423
Not bad, man. Some choice cuts.

77
00:08:21,655 --> 00:08:25,102
But your prime, A-grade, <i>numero uno...</i>

78
00:08:25,182 --> 00:08:27,235
<i>...pièce de résistance...</i>

79
00:08:27,589 --> 00:08:29,975
...is gonna have to be...

80
00:08:30,055 --> 00:08:31,776
...yeah!

81
00:08:31,856 --> 00:08:33,876
This shit's got a date
with the local photocopier.

82
00:08:33,956 --> 00:08:36,222
Yeah? What are you gonna do?

83
00:08:37,222 --> 00:08:39,956
You want to live the dream, don't ya?

84
00:08:40,056 --> 00:08:43,076
Want the world to see
your amazing photography?

85
00:08:43,156 --> 00:08:47,242
Well, lucky you got friends like us,
even if you're too stupid to realize it.

86
00:08:47,322 --> 00:08:49,772
Dude, New York had nothing to do with you.

87
00:08:50,189 --> 00:08:52,189
You don't ever get bored?

88
00:08:52,289 --> 00:08:54,242
Same old shit every day?

89
00:08:54,322 --> 00:08:56,542
Don't you ever want to get out of here?

90
00:08:56,622 --> 00:08:59,875
<i>Hombre...</i> I'm a god here.

91
00:08:59,955 --> 00:09:03,022
Weed to smoke, bitches to fuck.

92
00:09:03,356 --> 00:09:06,822
- Fags to bash.
- What's he done to you?

93
00:09:07,289 --> 00:09:09,689
Let me explain to you the law of the jungle.

94
00:09:10,705 --> 00:09:13,755
You want to run with the wolves,
you gotta kill a few lambs.

95
00:09:15,256 --> 00:09:17,489
So which one you gonna be?

96
00:09:20,422 --> 00:09:24,489
- Fine. Go nuts.
- Yeah, that's what I'm talking about!

97
00:09:25,356 --> 00:09:27,709
Now, can you stop being a buzzkill?

98
00:09:27,789 --> 00:09:30,449
Please? It's Halloween.

99
00:10:49,621 --> 00:10:51,189
Yeah!

100
00:11:11,523 --> 00:11:13,355
Care to do the honors?

101
00:11:14,222 --> 00:11:17,622
- Law of the jungle, huh?
- We all live by it, mate.

102
00:12:24,656 --> 00:12:26,589
What are you meant to be?

103
00:12:26,669 --> 00:12:28,824
A sheep in wolves' clothing?

104
00:12:29,488 --> 00:12:31,076
Whatever.

105
00:12:31,655 --> 00:12:35,056
Halloween's just an American
invention to sell lollies.

106
00:12:39,689 --> 00:12:41,222
Incorrect.

107
00:12:57,655 --> 00:13:00,522
Oh, yeah? Enlighten me.

108
00:13:07,455 --> 00:13:11,709
'Tis the night,
the night of the grave's delight.

109
00:13:11,789 --> 00:13:14,275
And the warlocks are at their play.

110
00:13:14,755 --> 00:13:18,342
Ye think that without,
the wild winds shout...

111
00:13:18,422 --> 00:13:21,656
...but no, it is they, it is they.

112
00:15:21,922 --> 00:15:25,683
Nice pic. But not your finest hour.

113
00:15:25,763 --> 00:15:27,389
The boys think it is.

114
00:15:30,712 --> 00:15:34,189
'Cause I know they're the first ones
I'd turn to for an art critique.

115
00:15:35,255 --> 00:15:38,375
- What's the problem?
- Who said there was a problem?

116
00:15:38,455 --> 00:15:40,842
You only fry your brain
when there's something on it.

117
00:15:40,922 --> 00:15:42,756
My brain's fine.

118
00:15:43,823 --> 00:15:45,822
At least nangs don't give you cancer.

119
00:15:47,855 --> 00:15:49,675
It's worth it.

120
00:15:49,755 --> 00:15:52,111
Hey, why don't you come down from there?

121
00:15:52,191 --> 00:15:56,642
I hate heights. My bedroom's on the
first floor, and even that freaks me out.

122
00:15:56,722 --> 00:15:59,342
There are way more scary things than falling.

123
00:16:07,722 --> 00:16:10,923
Sort of closing,
circling around her, and then...

124
00:16:20,021 --> 00:16:23,255
You know, you're a much nicer guy
when you're not around them.

125
00:16:23,855 --> 00:16:25,922
We all do shit to fit in.

126
00:16:27,055 --> 00:16:28,809
Is it worth it?

127
00:16:28,889 --> 00:16:32,010
Just 'cause they're good with
a sodastream, doesn't make them...

128
00:16:32,090 --> 00:16:34,155
<i>...amigos para siempre.</i>

129
00:16:36,155 --> 00:16:40,388
- How about you back off my mates?
- These guys don't get you.

130
00:16:43,689 --> 00:16:45,489
We're teenagers.

131
00:16:46,722 --> 00:16:49,742
Nobody gets us. That's half the fun.

132
00:16:49,822 --> 00:16:51,355
No.

133
00:16:52,589 --> 00:16:55,388
Everyone has somebody who understands them.

134
00:16:58,921 --> 00:17:02,322
You're not the only one who wants
out of this town, you know.

135
00:17:03,355 --> 00:17:05,241
Who said I want out?

136
00:17:05,321 --> 00:17:07,555
Got everything I need right here.

137
00:17:10,855 --> 00:17:14,055
Weed to smoke, fags to bash, bitches to...

138
00:17:14,889 --> 00:17:16,389
...fuck.

139
00:17:21,321 --> 00:17:23,439
Spliff's up.

140
00:17:24,288 --> 00:17:25,775
Romany?

141
00:17:25,855 --> 00:17:27,655
Tokey-toke?

142
00:17:39,887 --> 00:17:41,954
What about you, coz?

143
00:17:47,221 --> 00:17:49,055
Another toke?

144
00:17:49,455 --> 00:17:51,522
I'm good.

145
00:17:58,055 --> 00:18:00,773
Corey! Where are you going?

146
00:19:36,722 --> 00:19:39,555
Oh, shit! I'm late for work.

147
00:19:40,388 --> 00:19:42,222
Skip it.

148
00:19:45,955 --> 00:19:48,275
- Wait.
- Some of us gotta earn a buck.

149
00:19:48,355 --> 00:19:52,041
Yeah, like daddy wouldn't
buy you anything you asked for.

150
00:19:52,121 --> 00:19:56,845
What's wrong? You scared the baby birds
are all grown up and leaving the nest?

151
00:19:56,925 --> 00:19:58,774
Poor Jango.

152
00:19:58,854 --> 00:20:02,675
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.
- Move! I've got graveyard shift.

153
00:20:02,754 --> 00:20:05,622
Then you're... right where you need to be.

154
00:20:09,155 --> 00:20:12,522
Boys! We're moving out. Get up.

155
00:20:13,821 --> 00:20:15,888
Quicker! Let's go.

156
00:20:22,622 --> 00:20:25,455
- Trick or treat.
- -Hey, Deirdre, you coming?

157
00:20:46,422 --> 00:20:48,012
Hey, you okay?

158
00:20:52,455 --> 00:20:54,655
Are you trying to kill me?

159
00:20:54,954 --> 00:20:56,788
Oh, fuck!

160
00:20:58,255 --> 00:21:00,309
Why can't you arseholes leave me alone?

161
00:21:00,988 --> 00:21:02,222
You don't own the park.

162
00:21:02,302 --> 00:21:05,158
Shouldn't you be with your wolves
gang-banging some mental defective...

163
00:21:05,238 --> 00:21:07,374
...from the drama class?

164
00:21:07,454 --> 00:21:09,698
- At least I got mates.
- Yeah, I'm sure they're awesome...

165
00:21:09,778 --> 00:21:13,108
- ...once you get to know them.
- Yeah, they are.

166
00:21:13,188 --> 00:21:15,388
Then why are you here?

167
00:21:27,421 --> 00:21:29,288
You're bleeding.

168
00:21:52,388 --> 00:21:54,235
Oh, shit!

169
00:22:01,021 --> 00:22:03,821
- Still gullible.
- Oh, you fucker!

170
00:22:05,955 --> 00:22:08,529
And then you wonder why nobody likes you.

171
00:22:08,788 --> 00:22:11,808
- Got anything to eat?
- Do I look like a servo?

172
00:22:11,888 --> 00:22:14,854
- You must have scored trick or treating.
- It's kids stuff, man.

173
00:22:14,934 --> 00:22:17,205
- We're kids.
- Well, you, maybe.

174
00:22:17,285 --> 00:22:21,009
Right. I forgot, gramps.
That's why you're dressed as teen wolf.

175
00:22:21,089 --> 00:22:23,122
And what are you supposed to be?

176
00:22:24,121 --> 00:22:25,921
Your mum?

177
00:22:30,431 --> 00:22:33,322
What? Jonah. Hey!

178
00:22:33,788 --> 00:22:36,208
Hey, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

179
00:22:36,288 --> 00:22:39,821
Wasn't cool. You can hit me if you want.

180
00:22:40,021 --> 00:22:42,255
One free hit, anywhere you want.

181
00:22:44,221 --> 00:22:46,055
Walk me home.

182
00:22:47,321 --> 00:22:49,155
I'm not gonna hit you.

183
00:22:50,005 --> 00:22:52,205
You're gonna walk me home instead.

184
00:22:52,854 --> 00:22:54,875
Get fucked. I'm not going anywhere with you.

185
00:22:54,955 --> 00:22:57,321
Maybe I have a concussion.

186
00:22:57,421 --> 00:22:59,774
Maybe I'll get lost.

187
00:22:59,854 --> 00:23:02,489
Maybe I'll fall and never wake up.

188
00:23:03,555 --> 00:23:06,941
Or maybe, you owe me...

189
00:23:07,021 --> 00:23:08,888
...old pal.

190
00:23:18,688 --> 00:23:21,522
If I knew they were coming,
I'd have baked a cake.

191
00:23:23,588 --> 00:23:26,834
Fine, but we're going now. Alright? Move it.

192
00:23:28,954 --> 00:23:32,588
- But aren't we gonna say hello first?
- Hurry it up, dickhead.

193
00:24:21,521 --> 00:24:24,555
Hey. Notice where we are?

194
00:24:25,754 --> 00:24:27,588
A bridge?

195
00:24:28,588 --> 00:24:30,455
Not just any bridge.

196
00:24:35,921 --> 00:24:37,955
The bridge over Cocytus.

197
00:24:38,455 --> 00:24:40,292
Where the veils are thin...

198
00:24:40,521 --> 00:24:44,322
...and once we cross,
we leave the mortal realm.

199
00:24:46,221 --> 00:24:49,674
Once we cross, we leave the mortal realm.

200
00:24:49,754 --> 00:24:53,555
And enter the world of enchantment,
where we see things as they really are.

201
00:24:55,021 --> 00:24:57,055
Where dreams are true.

202
00:24:57,654 --> 00:24:59,488
Stories too.

203
00:25:02,921 --> 00:25:04,754
I miss that game.

204
00:25:05,021 --> 00:25:07,288
Everything was simpler then.

205
00:25:08,355 --> 00:25:11,422
- And boring.
- "Boring"?

206
00:25:11,788 --> 00:25:15,908
We saw zombies and ghosts and werewolves.

207
00:25:16,088 --> 00:25:19,488
- I was never bored.
- It was just a stupid game.

208
00:25:21,388 --> 00:25:25,034
It was kids, trying to spook each other
with a bunch of fairy tales...

209
00:25:25,114 --> 00:25:27,042
...and chickenshit dares.

210
00:25:28,221 --> 00:25:30,454
Well, let's play again.

211
00:25:30,888 --> 00:25:34,308
- We're not kids anymore.
- We're not grown-ups either.

212
00:25:34,388 --> 00:25:37,389
Not yet. And besides...

213
00:25:37,888 --> 00:25:40,088
...I have something to show you.

214
00:25:42,588 --> 00:25:46,988
Believe me, there's nothing you could
show me that I'd possibly give a shit about.

215
00:25:47,821 --> 00:25:49,888
You sure about that?

216
00:25:58,454 --> 00:26:00,521
Your head still hurt?

217
00:26:01,121 --> 00:26:02,895
Excruciating.

218
00:26:04,488 --> 00:26:08,288
This thing that you wanted to show me,
it'd better blow my mind, alright?

219
00:26:09,205 --> 00:26:10,672
It's a promise.

220
00:26:18,122 --> 00:26:21,521
This is just for tonight. Don't think
'cause we're talking, we're friends.

221
00:26:22,821 --> 00:26:24,688
I wouldn't dream of it.

222
00:26:27,621 --> 00:26:30,875
And remember the rules.
Game isn't over till we get home.

223
00:26:30,955 --> 00:26:33,588
No wimping out midway through. I know.

224
00:26:36,221 --> 00:26:38,088
Ready to cross?

225
00:26:41,021 --> 00:26:42,821
You're on.

226
00:26:46,854 --> 00:26:48,741
<i>'Tis the night...</i>

227
00:26:48,821 --> 00:26:52,621
<i>...the night of the grave's delight.</i>

228
00:27:04,088 --> 00:27:05,655
Hey.

229
00:27:06,055 --> 00:27:07,888
Short cut.

230
00:27:09,854 --> 00:27:13,088
It rained last week.
I'm not going in some deathtrap drain.

231
00:27:14,088 --> 00:27:16,108
Come on. This is Cocytus.

232
00:27:16,188 --> 00:27:18,608
It's more than a drain. It's a passageway.

233
00:27:18,688 --> 00:27:22,721
It could lead us anywhere.
Where's your sense of adventure?

234
00:27:23,688 --> 00:27:26,694
Where's your common sense?
I don't want to go in there.

235
00:27:26,774 --> 00:27:30,255
Scared? Scared certain death lurks within?

236
00:27:31,021 --> 00:27:33,288
It's not death I'm scared of.

237
00:27:34,888 --> 00:27:36,688
Jeannie was scared.

238
00:27:37,854 --> 00:27:39,721
Is this part of the game?

239
00:27:40,454 --> 00:27:42,721
Haven't you heard the stories?

240
00:27:45,155 --> 00:27:47,021
Once there was...

241
00:27:48,317 --> 00:27:50,454
...and once there was not.

242
00:27:51,621 --> 00:27:55,654
<i>A girl called Jeannie
who was afraid of the dark.</i>

243
00:27:55,754 --> 00:27:59,554
<i>She played Cocytus too with her older sister.</i>

244
00:28:00,421 --> 00:28:06,050
<i>In her fantasy, they were princesses
living in a castle far, far away.</i>

245
00:28:06,621 --> 00:28:09,641
<i>Two dreamers, united against the world...</i>

246
00:28:10,221 --> 00:28:13,022
<i>...waiting for their lives to begin.</i>

247
00:28:13,888 --> 00:28:16,888
<i>And one day, the knights came.</i>

248
00:28:17,721 --> 00:28:20,955
<i>But they weren't valiant or brave.</i>

249
00:28:21,654 --> 00:28:26,341
<i>And though they were pretty,
the girls weren't wise.</i>

250
00:28:26,421 --> 00:28:29,217
<i>For wolves may lurk...</i>

251
00:28:29,296 --> 00:28:31,684
<i>...in any guise.</i>

252
00:28:34,188 --> 00:28:38,521
<i>She didn't want to be left behind,
so she followed.</i>

253
00:28:42,055 --> 00:28:45,176
<i>But the distance between them
grew and grew...</i>

254
00:28:45,255 --> 00:28:49,088
<i>...until she could barely
see her sister anymore.</i>

255
00:28:54,504 --> 00:28:57,205
<i>While Jeannie was afraid of the dark...</i>

256
00:28:57,285 --> 00:28:59,967
<i>...she was more scared of being left behind.</i>

257
00:29:03,420 --> 00:29:04,775
Katherine!

258
00:29:04,855 --> 00:29:07,774
<i>But Jeannie didn't know
that there are some dark places...</i>

259
00:29:07,854 --> 00:29:10,122
<i>...one should never walk alone.</i>

260
00:29:12,254 --> 00:29:14,475
<i>For tunnels can be longer than they appear.</i>

261
00:29:14,555 --> 00:29:16,442
Katherine!

262
00:29:16,522 --> 00:29:20,218
<i>And there are things in this world
we don't read about in the storybooks.</i>

263
00:29:23,138 --> 00:29:25,972
<i>Not everyone can survive the dark.</i>

264
00:29:31,354 --> 00:29:33,188
Did she die?

265
00:29:33,988 --> 00:29:36,421
Can't have a good story without a dead body.

266
00:29:37,287 --> 00:29:41,078
Now she's just another lonely ghost
haunting these tunnels.

267
00:29:41,157 --> 00:29:42,988
The saddest part...

268
00:29:43,838 --> 00:29:46,105
...she doesn't even know she's dead.

269
00:29:47,287 --> 00:29:49,108
Ghosts, huh?

270
00:29:50,287 --> 00:29:52,825
Suppose you believe in the tooth fairy too.

271
00:29:52,905 --> 00:29:54,641
Light a match.

272
00:29:54,721 --> 00:29:58,143
Only when she sees light
does she realize she's dead.

273
00:29:59,254 --> 00:30:02,174
And her scream will stay with you
till the day you die.

274
00:30:02,254 --> 00:30:03,509
- You're trippin'.
- Light it.

275
00:30:03,589 --> 00:30:06,021
- You're retarded.
- You're scared.

276
00:30:10,654 --> 00:30:12,688
Least I'm not the only one.

277
00:31:20,904 --> 00:31:22,738
Be ready.

278
00:31:25,921 --> 00:31:28,275
Yeah, Kurt Cobain.
You don't know who Kurt Cobain is?

279
00:31:28,355 --> 00:31:29,368
No.

280
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:09,054
Hey!

281
00:32:11,888 --> 00:32:13,688
Who wants to go hunting?

282
00:32:32,574 --> 00:32:36,107
Miss Susie had a steamboat.

283
00:32:36,187 --> 00:32:39,021
The steamboat had a bell.

284
00:32:39,621 --> 00:32:42,474
Miss Susie went to heaven.

285
00:32:42,954 --> 00:32:45,755
The steamboat went to hell.

286
00:32:55,554 --> 00:32:57,154
I wish you'd go away.

287
00:33:04,621 --> 00:33:07,288
We taking High Street or Cotham?

288
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:16,554
I'm not falling for your shit again.

289
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:25,154
Yeah, I am.

290
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:45,287
Suppose you want to walk
on the other side of the street.

291
00:33:46,721 --> 00:33:48,921
This place doesn't scare me anymore.

292
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:53,788
Yeah, right.

293
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:58,354
You used to wet yourself
when we passed Boo Radley's.

294
00:34:03,454 --> 00:34:05,254
His name is Edward.

295
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:16,920
It's open.

296
00:34:23,054 --> 00:34:24,874
I'm not going inside.

297
00:34:25,354 --> 00:34:27,987
You have to. We're playing Cocytus.

298
00:34:32,488 --> 00:34:36,121
When exactly did someone shove a straw
up your arse and suck out all the fun?

299
00:34:41,688 --> 00:34:43,254
Fine.

300
00:34:44,187 --> 00:34:46,821
Hey. Can I borrow your board for a second?

301
00:35:01,987 --> 00:35:04,205
- Guess you'd better go get it.
- Fuck!

302
00:35:28,788 --> 00:35:31,174
- This is where it happened.
- What? Let me out.

303
00:35:31,254 --> 00:35:34,721
Poor Edward. He was only ten years old.

304
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:38,174
I'm gonna kick you really hard in the face.

305
00:35:38,454 --> 00:35:40,741
Edward's dreams were so big.

306
00:35:40,820 --> 00:35:43,341
They were like universes unfolding forever.

307
00:35:46,020 --> 00:35:49,449
In Edward's world, a paper plane...

308
00:35:49,529 --> 00:35:51,610
...could be a turbojet...

309
00:35:51,887 --> 00:35:54,087
<i>...fighting the forces of darkness.</i>

310
00:35:59,987 --> 00:36:03,621
<i>The trees were allies,
hiding you in their branches.</i>

311
00:36:05,488 --> 00:36:08,488
<i>And Edward ruled it all from his island base.</i>

312
00:36:12,688 --> 00:36:17,174
<i>And then, one summer's day,
Edward made a promise...</i>

313
00:36:17,254 --> 00:36:20,275
<i>...here in the presence
of the masters of the universe...</i>

314
00:36:20,355 --> 00:36:23,421
<i>...the sea monkeys and the galactic army.</i>

315
00:36:23,987 --> 00:36:27,374
<i>He swore an oath to follow his dreams...</i>

316
00:36:27,454 --> 00:36:30,074
<i>...no matter how ridiculous...</i>

317
00:36:30,154 --> 00:36:34,555
<i>...to explore the shadows,
no matter how scary.</i>

318
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:39,188
<i>And his vow was heard.</i>

319
00:36:40,521 --> 00:36:43,588
You absolute muppet!

320
00:36:44,787 --> 00:36:49,677
<i>When you're a kid, you want to explore
and see what's hiding in the shadows...</i>

321
00:36:49,756 --> 00:36:52,207
<i>...even if it scares the shit out of you.</i>

322
00:36:52,287 --> 00:36:54,721
<i>You'll cross the bridge over Cocytus.</i>

323
00:36:55,287 --> 00:36:56,979
<i>But...</i>

324
00:36:57,059 --> 00:37:00,476
<i>...as people grow older,
they lose that wonder.</i>

325
00:37:00,787 --> 00:37:04,455
<i>Scary things aren't fun anymore, just scary.</i>

326
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:07,188
<i>So they shut them out.</i>

327
00:37:13,354 --> 00:37:17,041
<i>The dreams he once promised
to live were stored away in boxes...</i>

328
00:37:17,421 --> 00:37:19,674
<i>...stored away for another day...</i>

329
00:37:19,753 --> 00:37:23,840
<i>...and the days passed,
and the dreams were quickly forgotten.</i>

330
00:37:24,420 --> 00:37:25,878
<i>But...</i>

331
00:37:25,958 --> 00:37:28,633
<i>...abandon your dreams and they can become...</i>

332
00:37:29,654 --> 00:37:31,304
...resentful.

333
00:37:31,554 --> 00:37:35,954
<i>And as poor Edward let life's
little compromises accumulate...</i>

334
00:37:36,654 --> 00:37:41,223
<i>...the gap between who he was
and who he wanted to be...</i>

335
00:37:41,303 --> 00:37:43,186
<i>...grew larger.</i>

336
00:37:44,187 --> 00:37:48,421
<i>And as his dreams turned to darklings...</i>

337
00:37:48,521 --> 00:37:51,988
<i>...the sparkle faded from his eyes.</i>

338
00:38:01,854 --> 00:38:03,920
<i>Now he sits there...</i>

339
00:38:04,421 --> 00:38:07,174
<i>...in front of the TV, late into the night...</i>

340
00:38:07,254 --> 00:38:09,860
<i>...with the volume turned way up.</i>

341
00:38:10,254 --> 00:38:14,121
<i>And he knows that one day,
he'll have to pay the price...</i>

342
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:18,787
<i>...for breaking his promise
and abandoning his dreams.</i>

343
00:38:26,953 --> 00:38:28,807
<i>And that price...</i>

344
00:38:28,887 --> 00:38:31,740
<i>...is why I don't ever...</i>

345
00:38:31,820 --> 00:38:33,887
<i>...want to grow up.</i>

346
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:44,387
Shit! Get off!

347
00:38:48,454 --> 00:38:50,341
Do you expect me to believe that?

348
00:38:50,421 --> 00:38:54,898
Sometimes you have to pull back a piece
of reality when it gets in the way.

349
00:38:55,620 --> 00:38:57,355
I think you're full of shit.

350
00:38:58,521 --> 00:39:00,554
Take a look in the window.

351
00:39:04,953 --> 00:39:06,673
You look in it.

352
00:39:06,753 --> 00:39:08,907
I'm not the one that doesn't believe.

353
00:39:08,987 --> 00:39:10,773
It's, what...

354
00:39:10,853 --> 00:39:12,640
...twenty meters?

355
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:14,374
Then I'll let you out.

356
00:40:13,820 --> 00:40:15,654
Trick or treat!

357
00:40:17,620 --> 00:40:19,198
Shit!

358
00:40:26,987 --> 00:40:28,988
Why the fuck did you do that?

359
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:32,194
- Come on. It was funny.
- You know I hate being scared.

360
00:40:32,274 --> 00:40:34,074
No, I don't.

361
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:37,640
The Corey I knew loved being scared.

362
00:40:37,720 --> 00:40:39,740
Halloween was his favorite day of the year.

363
00:40:39,820 --> 00:40:42,540
His head was full of dreams
he was gonna live.

364
00:40:42,620 --> 00:40:44,620
What happened to you?

365
00:40:48,120 --> 00:40:49,920
It's called survival.

366
00:40:51,187 --> 00:40:53,187
Law of the jungle.

367
00:40:53,687 --> 00:40:55,188
Survival.

368
00:41:02,288 --> 00:41:04,088
You clearly don't have a concussion.

369
00:41:06,454 --> 00:41:08,677
Find your own way home, right?

370
00:41:14,454 --> 00:41:15,734
Okay, truce.

371
00:41:17,287 --> 00:41:19,473
I'll stop trying to freak you out if...

372
00:41:19,553 --> 00:41:22,187
<i>...you stop running away for once.</i>

373
00:41:27,424 --> 00:41:29,520
I'll even make it up to you.

374
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:38,421
How?

375
00:41:40,120 --> 00:41:41,640
School?

376
00:41:42,120 --> 00:41:43,604
Best years of our lives.

377
00:41:46,420 --> 00:41:49,220
You have a funny way
of making it up to people.

378
00:41:57,620 --> 00:41:59,487
Chuck us your board.

379
00:41:59,987 --> 00:42:01,787
What about security?

380
00:42:05,387 --> 00:42:07,587
Is there anything you're not scared of?

381
00:42:11,420 --> 00:42:13,487
I didn't say I was scared.

382
00:42:15,620 --> 00:42:17,720
I just have a cautionary nature.

383
00:43:50,787 --> 00:43:52,313
Boom.

384
00:44:08,319 --> 00:44:10,954
See? Easy as.

385
00:44:22,487 --> 00:44:25,034
You know, most people
aren't really scared of heights.

386
00:44:25,114 --> 00:44:27,553
At least... not of falling.

387
00:44:27,853 --> 00:44:29,854
What are they scared of, then?

388
00:44:30,620 --> 00:44:32,653
They're scared they'll jump.

389
00:44:35,887 --> 00:44:38,108
Is this the thing you wanted to show me?

390
00:44:38,587 --> 00:44:40,854
This is a thing I wanted to show you.

391
00:44:44,987 --> 00:44:48,241
Shit. What's with all the birds?

392
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:51,520
They say animals know when they're gonna die.

393
00:44:52,220 --> 00:44:54,420
So they come here for their final moments.

394
00:44:56,120 --> 00:44:58,154
I like to keep them company.

395
00:45:00,087 --> 00:45:02,120
Nobody should die alone.

396
00:45:46,853 --> 00:45:48,943
When my dog died, he knew.

397
00:45:50,087 --> 00:45:53,353
Went off behind the rubbish tip
at the back of the yard.

398
00:45:54,887 --> 00:45:57,154
Took us, like, three days to find him.

399
00:46:00,053 --> 00:46:01,920
My mum knew.

400
00:46:02,753 --> 00:46:06,767
She was always worried, 'cause she had me
late, that she wouldn't always be around.

401
00:46:10,286 --> 00:46:14,887
That's why she always used to tell stories
about fantasy lands where I'd be safe.

402
00:46:17,687 --> 00:46:19,920
It's one way to survive, I guess.

403
00:46:27,853 --> 00:46:30,253
Is that why she always played that song?

404
00:46:31,120 --> 00:46:32,695
You remember that?

405
00:46:37,348 --> 00:46:42,971
<i>When you walk through a storm</i>

406
00:46:43,051 --> 00:46:48,273
<i>Hold your head up high</i>

407
00:46:48,353 --> 00:46:50,020
You shouldn't sing.

408
00:46:54,520 --> 00:46:56,540
It's bullshit, anyway.

409
00:46:56,820 --> 00:46:58,673
"You'll never walk alone."

410
00:46:58,753 --> 00:47:00,707
I'd rather be alone.

411
00:47:00,787 --> 00:47:03,054
No one to rely on but yourself.

412
00:47:03,386 --> 00:47:05,653
No one to drag you down.

413
00:47:06,219 --> 00:47:08,718
Nobody to have your back either.

414
00:47:10,653 --> 00:47:13,339
I remember this exhibition at the museum.

415
00:47:13,419 --> 00:47:15,253
There was a quote.

416
00:47:15,553 --> 00:47:19,354
"Man is by nature a social animal.

417
00:47:19,987 --> 00:47:23,988
Anyone who does not partake of society...

418
00:47:25,020 --> 00:47:26,854
...is either a beast...

419
00:47:28,620 --> 00:47:30,420
...or a God."

420
00:47:32,353 --> 00:47:35,109
Jango would say you're a little lamb.

421
00:47:35,189 --> 00:47:37,253
At least I'm not a beast.

422
00:47:37,807 --> 00:47:40,471
Can you say the same, dances with wolves?

423
00:47:50,386 --> 00:47:54,220
If there's one thing I won't miss,
it's these corridors.

424
00:47:59,219 --> 00:48:01,487
Feels like we should do a nudie run.

425
00:48:06,019 --> 00:48:08,220
Or you too scared of security?

426
00:48:10,453 --> 00:48:13,339
It's not security you need
to be worried about.

427
00:48:13,420 --> 00:48:15,907
It's the wolves in the walls that'll get ya.

428
00:48:16,619 --> 00:48:19,086
<i>I hoped we were done with these stories.</i>

429
00:48:19,853 --> 00:48:21,654
<i>This isn't a story.</i>

430
00:48:22,286 --> 00:48:24,553
<i>Everyone notices different things.</i>

431
00:48:25,253 --> 00:48:27,654
Some notice the moment you change your hair.

432
00:48:28,453 --> 00:48:31,253
Others always notice
what shoes you're wearing.

433
00:48:33,453 --> 00:48:35,087
I noticed them change.

434
00:48:39,453 --> 00:48:42,120
<i>It was the smell I noticed first.</i>

435
00:48:43,019 --> 00:48:47,053
<i>The stench of twisting, multiplying hormones.</i>

436
00:48:47,988 --> 00:48:50,110
<i>It always preceded them.</i>

437
00:48:50,520 --> 00:48:54,320
<i>No amount of cheap safeway
deodorant can cover that odor.</i>

438
00:48:59,887 --> 00:49:03,120
I saw skin disappear
beneath unwelcome hair...

439
00:49:03,940 --> 00:49:06,840
<i>...voices deepen into growls.</i>

440
00:49:06,920 --> 00:49:09,120
<i>Like a virus, it spread.</i>

441
00:49:09,753 --> 00:49:12,373
<i>And once that toxin poisons you...</i>

442
00:49:12,853 --> 00:49:16,127
<i>...you're capable of doing things
you never thought you'd do...</i>

443
00:49:16,787 --> 00:49:18,888
<i>...all in the name of survival.</i>

444
00:49:24,514 --> 00:49:27,009
<i>No matter where you hide...</i>

445
00:49:27,089 --> 00:49:28,969
<i>...they sniff you out.</i>

446
00:49:40,653 --> 00:49:42,720
And for those that didn't change...

447
00:49:44,387 --> 00:49:46,654
<i>...those that were left behind...</i>

448
00:49:53,019 --> 00:49:55,887
<i>...those that didn't have
the taste for blood...</i>

449
00:49:59,986 --> 00:50:03,000
<i>...there was only one thing you could do.</i>

450
00:50:34,653 --> 00:50:35,841
Jonah!

451
00:50:59,787 --> 00:51:01,320
Jonah?

452
00:51:19,720 --> 00:51:21,787
There's only one thing you can do.

453
00:52:37,786 --> 00:52:41,440
Welcome to the library, the sanctuary
for geeks, freaks and outcasts.

454
00:52:41,520 --> 00:52:44,608
Guess you're one of us now.
One of us! One of us!

455
00:52:44,688 --> 00:52:47,573
- Why'd you disappear?
- To see how you liked it.

456
00:52:47,653 --> 00:52:50,487
- I didn't.
- Well, color me surprised.

457
00:53:04,520 --> 00:53:08,140
- Is there another way out of here?
- In a coffin?

458
00:53:08,220 --> 00:53:10,367
You really are no help.

459
00:53:23,587 --> 00:53:26,038
Well, I guess we're saved, then.

460
00:53:26,118 --> 00:53:27,906
- Wait.
- What?

461
00:53:27,986 --> 00:53:30,813
They're your friends.
What's the worst they could do?

462
00:53:30,893 --> 00:53:33,117
How's this for a chaos theory, arsehole?

463
00:53:35,252 --> 00:53:37,188
Yeah, Jango.

464
00:53:37,388 --> 00:53:40,187
He decked you sober.
You don't want to see him pissed.

465
00:53:41,253 --> 00:53:42,806
There you go.

466
00:53:42,886 --> 00:53:45,086
- Cheers.
- Wear that.

467
00:53:52,186 --> 00:53:55,187
He won't hurt me if he knows
I'm with you. Right?

468
00:53:59,752 --> 00:54:02,220
You still don't want to be seen with me.

469
00:54:04,119 --> 00:54:06,520
Nobody means anything to you, do they?

470
00:54:12,653 --> 00:54:14,920
Shitty books that you love so much.

471
00:54:19,553 --> 00:54:21,554
Shove these fireworks...

472
00:54:24,253 --> 00:54:25,689
I've got an idea.

473
00:54:27,952 --> 00:54:29,819
Shut up.

474
00:54:30,519 --> 00:54:32,406
Did you hear something?

475
00:54:32,486 --> 00:54:34,406
Wait, what?

476
00:54:34,486 --> 00:54:36,487
Come out and play.

477
00:54:39,219 --> 00:54:41,487
Where are you?

478
00:55:10,819 --> 00:55:12,620
Thank you.

479
00:55:37,520 --> 00:55:41,521
Do you know Laura Premble?
This place kinda reminds me of her.

480
00:55:43,019 --> 00:55:46,287
This isn't one of those
"Penthouse forum" stories, is it?

481
00:55:47,319 --> 00:55:50,772
Well... she was the first person
I, you know...

482
00:55:50,852 --> 00:55:53,053
...fooled around with.

483
00:55:54,453 --> 00:55:57,686
But no, a bunch of us
came here after year 11 formal.

484
00:55:58,719 --> 00:56:02,153
I barely knew her, but...
everyone was pairing up.

485
00:56:02,953 --> 00:56:04,819
I remember thinking...

486
00:56:05,253 --> 00:56:07,053
"...jackpot!"

487
00:56:10,019 --> 00:56:11,886
You liked her?

488
00:56:12,186 --> 00:56:13,753
Yeah.

489
00:56:15,652 --> 00:56:18,139
But, man, she could drink.

490
00:56:18,219 --> 00:56:20,487
She drank so much.

491
00:56:29,053 --> 00:56:31,120
She just got kinda quiet.

492
00:56:36,119 --> 00:56:38,753
She just sat there staring off into the dark.

493
00:56:44,886 --> 00:56:49,172
And she dropped a bottle. It smashed
on the concrete. She didn't even move.

494
00:56:56,353 --> 00:56:58,586
It's like she wasn't really there.

495
00:57:04,286 --> 00:57:06,353
It's not much of a story, I guess.

496
00:57:07,186 --> 00:57:09,020
What'd you do after formal?

497
00:57:11,319 --> 00:57:12,853
I didn't go.

498
00:57:16,153 --> 00:57:17,953
Oh, well...

499
00:57:22,153 --> 00:57:23,949
...I guess you didn't miss much.

500
00:58:04,219 --> 00:58:07,806
<i>Miss Susie had a steamboat,
the steamboat had a bell</i>

501
00:58:07,886 --> 00:58:11,713
<i>Miss Susie went to heaven,
the steamboat went to...</i>

502
00:58:15,519 --> 00:58:19,073
<i>Hello, operator, give me number nine</i>

503
00:58:19,153 --> 00:58:21,774
<i>- If you disconnect me
- I'll chop off your...</i>

504
00:58:21,854 --> 00:58:25,472
<i>Behind the refrigerator,
there was a piece of glass</i>

505
00:58:25,552 --> 00:58:28,516
<i>Miss Susie sat upon it,
and broke her little...</i>

506
00:58:28,596 --> 00:58:31,737
<i>Ask me no more questions,
tell me no more lies</i>

507
00:58:31,817 --> 00:58:33,627
<i>The boys are in the bathroom</i>

508
00:58:33,707 --> 00:58:36,340
<i>Zipping up their... flies are in the meadow</i>

509
00:58:36,420 --> 00:58:37,974
<i>Bees are in the park</i>

510
00:58:38,054 --> 00:58:41,974
<i>Miss Susie and her boyfriend
are kissing in the D-A-R-K</i>

511
00:58:42,054 --> 00:58:45,711
<i>D-A-R-K, D-A-R-K...</i>

512
00:58:58,253 --> 00:59:00,119
You still hungry?

513
00:59:23,586 --> 00:59:25,539
What the fuck? It's just me.

514
00:59:25,619 --> 00:59:27,486
I thought you hated Halloween.

515
00:59:29,619 --> 00:59:31,652
Twick or tweat.

516
00:59:34,886 --> 00:59:37,686
Here. You stink.

517
00:59:39,786 --> 00:59:41,839
It's not my fault there's a heatwave.

518
00:59:41,919 --> 00:59:45,719
It's the hole in the ozone layer.
Those spray cans don't help.

519
00:59:48,219 --> 00:59:50,953
You know in some places
it snows on Halloween?

520
00:59:51,986 --> 00:59:54,036
You like snow?

521
00:59:54,219 --> 00:59:56,053
I've never seen it.

522
00:59:57,419 --> 01:00:00,652
That's why I'm saving up all
my slave wage from this dump.

523
01:00:01,452 --> 01:00:03,719
So I can fly away to Canada.

524
01:00:04,419 --> 01:00:06,253
Get a log cabin.

525
01:00:07,719 --> 01:00:09,606
It snows most of the year there.

526
01:00:09,686 --> 01:00:12,753
The rivers are so frozen,
you can skate on them.

527
01:00:16,352 --> 01:00:18,786
It snows quite a bit in New York too.

528
01:00:21,086 --> 01:00:23,153
You're gonna go, aren't you?

529
01:00:29,253 --> 01:00:31,273
Did you ever let down a friend?

530
01:00:31,352 --> 01:00:33,366
Like stand someone up?

531
01:00:33,816 --> 01:00:37,159
Sure. If I had a dollar
for every person I left waiting...

532
01:00:37,239 --> 01:00:39,519
...under the clocks at Flinders Street...

533
01:00:42,153 --> 01:00:44,019
...I'd have nine dollars.

534
01:00:44,786 --> 01:00:46,287
No.

535
01:00:48,119 --> 01:00:49,986
I mean...

536
01:00:51,586 --> 01:00:55,586
...did you ever say that you'd be there
for someone no matter what...

537
01:00:58,002 --> 01:01:00,002
...and then you weren't?

538
01:01:02,385 --> 01:01:04,820
I had this one friend in primary school.

539
01:01:06,986 --> 01:01:10,606
She even joined me at callispastics,
even though she was a total unco.

540
01:01:10,786 --> 01:01:12,652
What happened to her?

541
01:01:15,385 --> 01:01:17,419
Never really thought about it.

542
01:01:19,186 --> 01:01:21,281
I went to a different high school...

543
01:01:21,770 --> 01:01:23,983
...started hanging out with other girls.

544
01:01:24,652 --> 01:01:26,686
The cool kids, you know.

545
01:01:28,786 --> 01:01:32,253
I just couldn't keep playing
with my little ponies forever, right?

546
01:01:35,219 --> 01:01:38,687
I guess I didn't notice when the gaps
between us got bigger and bigger.

547
01:01:41,752 --> 01:01:43,753
I haven't seen her for years.

548
01:01:46,352 --> 01:01:48,386
She was just a friend.

549
01:01:49,852 --> 01:01:51,386
Why?

550
01:01:53,953 --> 01:01:56,986
I guess sometimes you don't realize
who you've left behind.

551
01:02:00,519 --> 01:02:02,553
Or who's right in front of you.

552
01:02:06,919 --> 01:02:08,419
Yeah.

553
01:02:09,518 --> 01:02:10,903
Maybe.

554
01:02:13,739 --> 01:02:17,386
Or maybe you could get out
of your fucking diapers for once.

555
01:02:17,919 --> 01:02:22,006
You think you're frustrated here?
Try living in the same world in a skirt...

556
01:02:22,086 --> 01:02:25,639
...surrounded by a bunch of babies
who don't even notice you.

557
01:02:25,719 --> 01:02:28,131
Why can't you guys just grow up?

558
01:02:28,210 --> 01:02:30,226
Girls do! We just stand here...

559
01:02:30,306 --> 01:02:35,016
...waiting, while you guys are stuck
with your heads in the... trees.

560
01:02:37,086 --> 01:02:39,806
Is this 'cause I didn't
thank you for the slurpee?

561
01:02:39,886 --> 01:02:41,690
I don't under...

562
01:03:12,752 --> 01:03:14,619
We do want to grow up.

563
01:03:15,819 --> 01:03:18,672
There's just a part of us
that doesn't want to stop.

564
01:03:18,752 --> 01:03:20,319
Stop?

565
01:03:23,686 --> 01:03:25,552
Climbing trees.

566
01:03:28,060 --> 01:03:30,119
Trick or treat!

567
01:03:31,452 --> 01:03:32,953
Great.

568
01:03:40,218 --> 01:03:43,706
Well! Ring-a-ding-ding, cozza.

569
01:03:43,786 --> 01:03:47,106
You sly hound. Thought your head was hurting.

570
01:03:47,185 --> 01:03:48,973
Turns out you were just hurting for head.

571
01:03:49,053 --> 01:03:51,339
- Real smooth.
- Thank you.

572
01:03:51,419 --> 01:03:54,286
So? Where have you been?

573
01:03:55,218 --> 01:03:58,622
- Looking everywhere for you.
- Don't tell me you were getting bored?

574
01:03:58,702 --> 01:04:01,386
Hey, Bobby. Want to go for a ride?

575
01:04:03,686 --> 01:04:05,186
Hey.

576
01:04:06,118 --> 01:04:07,683
You're not...

577
01:04:07,763 --> 01:04:10,792
...pissed about before, are ya?

578
01:04:12,085 --> 01:04:15,152
I mean, any hole's a goal, you know.

579
01:04:15,886 --> 01:04:18,285
Maybe you shouldn't talk about her like that.

580
01:04:20,419 --> 01:04:23,407
Is this true love? It is, isn't it?

581
01:04:50,953 --> 01:04:54,761
Anyway, we're not done yet.
The night's not over. Copies ready?

582
01:04:54,941 --> 01:04:56,519
Almost.

583
01:04:59,552 --> 01:05:01,419
Forget something?

584
01:05:05,852 --> 01:05:07,773
Hey, guess what we found at the cemetery.

585
01:05:07,853 --> 01:05:10,569
- What?
- The little fag's mother.

586
01:05:10,649 --> 01:05:12,143
Yeah.

587
01:05:12,223 --> 01:05:15,046
And wait till you see
what we did to her tombstone.

588
01:05:15,485 --> 01:05:17,552
We're gonna need photos of it.

589
01:05:17,652 --> 01:05:21,089
So... grab your shit. Let's go.

590
01:05:21,818 --> 01:05:23,538
Got everything?

591
01:05:23,618 --> 01:05:27,272
- Slushy. Did you get me my slushy?
- Yeah, yeah. I got your slushy.

592
01:05:27,452 --> 01:05:29,105
Thank you.

593
01:05:29,185 --> 01:05:30,719
Nah.

594
01:05:33,952 --> 01:05:35,452
What?

595
01:05:39,619 --> 01:05:41,419
What's the problem, cozza?

596
01:05:42,018 --> 01:05:44,419
Is he your boyfriend or something?

597
01:05:48,686 --> 01:05:51,285
- I don't want to be like that.
- Like what?

598
01:05:52,552 --> 01:05:54,052
Cruel.

599
01:05:56,953 --> 01:05:59,205
Didn't know you batted for that team.

600
01:05:59,285 --> 01:06:01,185
What if I did?

601
01:06:01,265 --> 01:06:03,352
Would you still be my friend?

602
01:06:03,686 --> 01:06:06,233
Or would you throw dead animals at my house?

603
01:06:06,313 --> 01:06:09,305
Alright, what... what are you saying, man?

604
01:06:09,385 --> 01:06:11,372
Maybe I'm not one of you anymore.

605
01:06:12,451 --> 01:06:13,985
Hey.

606
01:06:14,852 --> 01:06:16,686
You are one of us.

607
01:06:17,719 --> 01:06:19,552
Or you're nobody.

608
01:06:19,953 --> 01:06:22,187
I guess you're friends with nobody, then?

609
01:06:22,816 --> 01:06:24,663
Fuck you!

610
01:06:25,720 --> 01:06:29,266
Fight! Fight!
Fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight!

611
01:06:46,485 --> 01:06:48,018
Mate.

612
01:06:48,786 --> 01:06:50,332
Nah.

613
01:07:03,752 --> 01:07:04,986
Corey!

614
01:07:19,019 --> 01:07:20,586
Fuck.

615
01:07:43,152 --> 01:07:44,719
Jonah!

616
01:07:46,586 --> 01:07:48,652
Jonah? You in there?

617
01:07:49,985 --> 01:07:51,486
Jonah?

618
01:08:15,418 --> 01:08:19,506
<i>Now he sits there, in front of the TV...</i>

619
01:08:19,586 --> 01:08:23,185
<i>...late into the night,
with the volume turned way up.</i>

620
01:12:08,751 --> 01:12:10,552
Turn off the light.

621
01:12:24,685 --> 01:12:26,552
Why'd you leave?

622
01:12:28,985 --> 01:12:31,018
You're the one who left.

623
01:12:40,618 --> 01:12:42,419
Come outside.

624
01:12:43,918 --> 01:12:45,805
- Why?
- 'Cause I want to explain.

625
01:12:45,885 --> 01:12:47,718
You can't.

626
01:13:09,118 --> 01:13:10,918
Keep it.

627
01:13:23,519 --> 01:13:25,585
You're breaking the rules, you know.

628
01:13:28,119 --> 01:13:29,985
What rules?

629
01:13:31,152 --> 01:13:32,652
Cocytus.

630
01:13:34,519 --> 01:13:38,018
- Game doesn't stop till we get home.
- That's kids stuff.

631
01:13:39,918 --> 01:13:41,452
So?

632
01:13:43,485 --> 01:13:45,152
We're kids.

633
01:13:47,152 --> 01:13:49,018
At least for tonight.

634
01:13:58,851 --> 01:14:01,119
You can be such a dick sometimes.

635
01:14:02,385 --> 01:14:03,885
Yeah.

636
01:14:05,051 --> 01:14:09,258
Come on. Best way to keep the wolf
from your door is to go to his.

637
01:14:29,785 --> 01:14:31,738
<i>One thing's for sure.</i>

638
01:14:31,818 --> 01:14:33,885
<i>Jango and I are no longer friends.</i>

639
01:14:40,918 --> 01:14:42,751
Thank you.

640
01:14:48,252 --> 01:14:50,485
Got time for one more house call.

641
01:14:54,985 --> 01:14:56,551
Fuck!

642
01:15:01,419 --> 01:15:03,106
Motherfucker.

643
01:17:00,401 --> 01:17:03,401
Are you trying to kill yourself? You'll fall.

644
01:17:04,185 --> 01:17:06,404
People aren't really scared of falling.

645
01:17:06,484 --> 01:17:10,038
- They're scared of jumping.
- I'm scared my dad will kill you.

646
01:17:10,118 --> 01:17:12,038
What are you doing here?

647
01:17:12,118 --> 01:17:14,985
- Is your face okay?
- Yeah, yeah.

648
01:17:16,851 --> 01:17:19,918
I just thought you might want
some snow on Halloween.

649
01:17:21,918 --> 01:17:24,574
- That stuff's toxic.
- So?

650
01:17:24,654 --> 01:17:27,485
- It'll give you cancer.
- It's worth it.

651
01:17:27,565 --> 01:17:31,585
- Romany, are you okay in there?
- I'm fine. Go back to bed.

652
01:17:32,517 --> 01:17:35,585
- You should go.
- One more thing.

653
01:17:41,585 --> 01:17:45,435
I owe you an apology.
I've been a real dick tonight.

654
01:17:46,351 --> 01:17:47,878
Just tonight?

655
01:17:49,218 --> 01:17:51,252
Maybe for a while.

656
01:17:54,018 --> 01:17:56,052
But I did notice you.

657
01:17:56,284 --> 01:18:01,252
And sometimes the boys just climb
the trees to get a better look at the view.

658
01:18:17,918 --> 01:18:19,718
Happy Halloween.

659
01:18:43,985 --> 01:18:47,152
You'll catch your death if you stay
in the snow for too long.

660
01:19:18,217 --> 01:19:20,052
So, what happens now?

661
01:19:23,751 --> 01:19:26,605
I think this is where you show me
one of your callisthenic routines.

662
01:19:26,685 --> 01:19:29,085
I will punch you in the face.

663
01:19:34,685 --> 01:19:37,805
I guess you go back
to the company of wolves...

664
01:19:37,885 --> 01:19:40,752
...and I get to escape
to the wilds of Canada.

665
01:19:44,251 --> 01:19:45,752
Unless...

666
01:19:46,517 --> 01:19:48,085
Unless?

667
01:19:48,938 --> 01:19:50,485
Well...

668
01:19:51,284 --> 01:19:53,685
...I don't know for sure, but...

669
01:19:54,618 --> 01:19:58,052
...I imagine there are some pretty
good photography courses in Canada.

670
01:20:01,518 --> 01:20:04,552
There would be a lot of beautiful
things there to capture.

671
01:20:10,785 --> 01:20:12,852
Do you really want me to come?

672
01:20:13,551 --> 01:20:18,004
Sometimes it's just easier to live your dream
if you have someone to share it with.

673
01:20:19,251 --> 01:20:23,902
And... maybe you don't come to Canada, but...

674
01:20:25,085 --> 01:20:27,551
...we can make sure we both get out of here.

675
01:20:34,451 --> 01:20:37,738
What, if... if I live my dream,
you'll live yours?

676
01:20:37,818 --> 01:20:39,504
Yeah.

677
01:20:39,668 --> 01:20:41,518
Want to swear?

678
01:20:42,751 --> 01:20:46,237
- Sure, motherfucker.
- No, I mean it.

679
01:20:46,317 --> 01:20:48,052
Let's do this.

680
01:20:48,518 --> 01:20:52,119
If you go back on this, I will come at
you in the black of some terrible night.

681
01:20:52,199 --> 01:20:55,268
And I will bring a pointy reckoning
that will shudder you.

682
01:21:04,384 --> 01:21:06,585
I'm through with breaking promises.

683
01:21:40,918 --> 01:21:43,237
- Don't fall.
- Too late.

684
01:21:43,317 --> 01:21:46,151
- Shut up.
- Okay.

685
01:22:13,184 --> 01:22:14,752
Jonah!

686
01:22:28,968 --> 01:22:30,171
Rex?

687
01:22:39,918 --> 01:22:42,318
Rex! Hey.

688
01:25:16,836 --> 01:25:23,841
<i>Oh, now feel it coming back again</i>

689
01:25:28,923 --> 01:25:35,597
<i>Like a rolling thunder chasing the wind</i>

690
01:25:40,673 --> 01:25:47,138
<i>Forces pulling from the center
of the Earth again</i>

691
01:25:52,314 --> 01:25:56,112
<i>I can feel it</i>

692
01:25:58,177 --> 01:26:01,866
<i>I can feel it</i>

693
01:26:04,028 --> 01:26:08,077
<i>I can feel it</i>

694
01:26:09,685 --> 01:26:12,538
- Come on.
- <i>I can feel it</i>

695
01:26:12,618 --> 01:26:14,258
Let's get out of here.

696
01:26:18,451 --> 01:26:19,951
Jonah.

697
01:26:46,217 --> 01:26:48,618
Jonah! Stop!

698
01:26:57,717 --> 01:27:00,551
What was that place? Who is that man?

699
01:27:00,917 --> 01:27:04,285
- I don't know him.
- He looked familiar.

700
01:27:05,017 --> 01:27:08,837
We meet him twice.
First time, you don't remember.

701
01:27:08,917 --> 01:27:11,185
The second time, you never forget.

702
01:27:38,317 --> 01:27:40,384
What if I lied to you?

703
01:27:41,050 --> 01:27:43,018
When I said I didn't want to grow up?

704
01:27:52,551 --> 01:27:54,104
Run.

705
01:27:54,184 --> 01:27:56,870
Run! Run!

706
01:28:13,817 --> 01:28:15,395
Jonah!

707
01:28:45,151 --> 01:28:46,851
We need more light.

708
01:29:00,917 --> 01:29:02,485
Hey.

709
01:29:04,317 --> 01:29:06,318
They can't hurt us if we stick together.

710
01:29:07,217 --> 01:29:09,305
They won't let us go forward.

711
01:29:09,784 --> 01:29:13,251
Then let's go back,
where the dreams are true.

712
01:29:14,017 --> 01:29:15,637
The stories too.

713
01:29:51,284 --> 01:29:54,351
Jonah. Jonah.

714
01:31:08,717 --> 01:31:10,584
We need to go higher.

715
01:32:05,184 --> 01:32:07,051
My best friend.

716
01:32:07,717 --> 01:32:10,151
Why did we leave all this behind?

717
01:32:10,784 --> 01:32:13,584
- We needed more.
- Did you?

718
01:32:15,550 --> 01:32:17,721
<i>Do you remember that day?</i>

719
01:32:18,051 --> 01:32:20,055
<i>Like it was yesterday.</i>

720
01:32:20,135 --> 01:32:23,302
<i>It kinda was, since we kept it so close.</i>

721
01:32:25,617 --> 01:32:27,704
<i>It was Halloween then too.</i>

722
01:32:28,084 --> 01:32:31,704
<i>We were all dressed up.
I still had my first camera.</i>

723
01:32:31,784 --> 01:32:33,784
<i>Don't make it too real.</i>

724
01:32:34,684 --> 01:32:39,837
<i>It was getting late. And it isn't midnight
when young boys turn into pumpkins.</i>

725
01:32:39,917 --> 01:32:42,550
<i>It's when the street lights turn on.</i>

726
01:32:44,784 --> 01:32:46,617
<i>It was a bad idea.</i>

727
01:32:47,617 --> 01:32:51,051
<i>The boys knew that from the start, but...</i>

728
01:32:52,151 --> 01:32:54,751
<i>...nobody wants to be the one left behind.</i>

729
01:32:58,650 --> 01:33:02,051
<i>Even though tunnels
can be longer than they appear.</i>

730
01:33:05,184 --> 01:33:09,665
<i>And there are things in this world
we don't read about in storybooks.</i>

731
01:33:15,984 --> 01:33:19,871
<i>Wolves may lurk in any guise.</i>

732
01:33:20,984 --> 01:33:23,018
<i>And only in the dark...</i>

733
01:33:23,450 --> 01:33:26,684
<i>...do we learn how far we'll go to survive.</i>

734
01:33:27,817 --> 01:33:30,851
<i>Even if it means running
as fast as you can...</i>

735
01:33:31,717 --> 01:33:34,564
<i>...and leaving behind everything you value.</i>

736
01:33:42,317 --> 01:33:43,818
Corey.

737
01:33:48,784 --> 01:33:51,817
<i>And that was the last time
that they played Cocytus.</i>

738
01:34:14,117 --> 01:34:16,184
It'll be morning soon.

739
01:35:05,316 --> 01:35:07,185
Is it getting cold?

740
01:35:08,884 --> 01:35:10,751
Think so.

741
01:35:16,950 --> 01:35:18,951
We have to go home eventually.

742
01:35:21,283 --> 01:35:23,284
Then the game will be over.

743
01:35:28,617 --> 01:35:31,061
What would happen if we change the ending?

744
01:35:33,250 --> 01:35:34,851
What ending?

745
01:35:36,850 --> 01:35:38,851
To the story in the drain.

746
01:35:41,750 --> 01:35:43,617
What if I...

747
01:35:50,884 --> 01:35:53,433
- ...what if he stayed?
- He left.

748
01:35:56,316 --> 01:35:58,184
Maybe he didn't.

749
01:36:02,784 --> 01:36:04,984
Maybe it just seemed like he did.

750
01:36:07,450 --> 01:36:10,517
And as he was walking away, he turned back...

751
01:36:11,050 --> 01:36:13,651
...'cause he realized
who his real friend was.

752
01:36:14,384 --> 01:36:18,144
'Cause together, they could do anything.
They could cross the bridge to Cocytus.

753
01:36:18,223 --> 01:36:21,650
They could outwit the darklings.
They could outrun the wolves.

754
01:36:22,051 --> 01:36:24,450
Why couldn't they defeat two bullies?

755
01:36:25,750 --> 01:36:27,604
And then?

756
01:36:27,684 --> 01:36:30,884
And then they live their dreams
like they promised each other.

757
01:36:32,751 --> 01:36:34,817
That's what should have happened.

758
01:36:36,650 --> 01:36:38,484
I like that ending.

759
01:36:41,684 --> 01:36:43,884
But that's not what happened.

760
01:36:50,917 --> 01:36:52,784
I'm ready to show you now.

761
01:37:05,116 --> 01:37:07,150
This is where we say goodbye.

762
01:37:08,817 --> 01:37:11,051
This where you live now, homey?

763
01:37:12,216 --> 01:37:14,284
Yeah, real mature, smart-arse.

764
01:37:16,917 --> 01:37:19,150
Thought you were in a hurry to grow up.

765
01:37:22,283 --> 01:37:24,517
Maybe I was a bit hasty on that one.

766
01:37:25,750 --> 01:37:27,617
Good to hear it.

767
01:37:45,850 --> 01:37:47,650
I'm sorry.

768
01:37:51,617 --> 01:37:53,417
For leaving.

769
01:37:57,550 --> 01:37:59,416
You know...

770
01:37:59,683 --> 01:38:01,150
...tonight...

771
01:38:02,617 --> 01:38:04,884
...kind of made up for the rest of it.

772
01:38:18,917 --> 01:38:20,750
Turn around.

773
01:38:33,917 --> 01:38:35,550
Jonah!

774
01:38:36,116 --> 01:38:37,984
Hey, Jonah!

775
01:38:54,817 --> 01:38:58,050
Oh, fuck! Fuck! Jonah!

776
01:40:30,818 --> 01:40:32,350
Dad!

777
01:40:33,418 --> 01:40:35,644
Dad, are you there?

778
01:40:39,150 --> 01:40:40,983
Dad, I need you.

779
01:42:23,617 --> 01:42:26,251
Judging by the state of his...

780
01:42:29,717 --> 01:42:32,536
...the... condition...

781
01:42:32,915 --> 01:42:35,970
...he's in, they think he
must have been in the water...

782
01:42:36,050 --> 01:42:39,117
...since late afternoon.

783
01:42:41,216 --> 01:42:43,003
He must have...

784
01:42:43,083 --> 01:42:46,883
...fallen while he was crossing and...

785
01:42:49,949 --> 01:42:51,816
...hit his head.

786
01:42:57,083 --> 01:42:59,084
We climbed trees together.

787
01:43:05,150 --> 01:43:07,217
That was a long time ago.

788
01:43:16,983 --> 01:43:19,450
Are we still going to the lake this weekend?

789
01:43:21,849 --> 01:43:23,571
Only if you want to.

790
01:43:24,316 --> 01:43:25,850
Yeah.

791
01:43:27,816 --> 01:43:29,617
I do.

792
01:43:31,816 --> 01:43:33,617
Are you ready to go?

793
01:43:38,383 --> 01:43:40,850
I just want to stay here a little longer.

794
01:43:44,384 --> 01:43:46,250
Your friends are here.

795
01:44:31,517 --> 01:44:33,350
Forget something?

796
01:45:39,983 --> 01:45:42,236
Hey, you there? Can you hear me?

797
01:45:42,316 --> 01:45:44,303
<i>You're cutting in and out a bit.</i>

798
01:45:44,383 --> 01:45:48,394
Yeah, this Wi-Fi's bullshit.
Dude, how are the performances going?

799
01:45:48,474 --> 01:45:50,603
- <i>Full houses so far.</i>
- Really?

800
01:45:50,683 --> 01:45:53,050
<i>Hey, look. Can you see it?</i>

801
01:45:56,966 --> 01:46:00,186
- Is it snow?
- <i>Yeah. Happy Halloween.</i>

802
01:46:01,315 --> 01:46:02,769
<i>Where are you heading tonight?</i>

803
01:46:02,849 --> 01:46:06,570
The voice are paying me to get shots
of the parade in the village tonight.

804
01:46:06,650 --> 01:46:08,490
<i>What are you gonna be?</i>

805
01:46:11,715 --> 01:46:13,250
Romany?

806
01:46:15,016 --> 01:46:17,100
Romany? Hello?
