1
00:02:24,729 --> 00:02:28,491
It's 4:15 on a Saturday morning
in El Paso town.

2
00:02:28,563 --> 00:02:32,121
This is Uncle Bruce here going on
with the farm and market report...

3
00:02:32,196 --> 00:02:35,458
on the station
all El Paso listens to.

4
00:04:08,362 --> 00:04:10,760
My mother told me
never to do this.

5
00:04:22,696 --> 00:04:24,286
Bless you.

6
00:04:27,563 --> 00:04:29,495
My name's Jim Halsey.

7
00:04:30,496 --> 00:04:33,223
John Ryder.

8
00:04:35,396 --> 00:04:37,988
So you want me
to drop you off somewhere?

9
00:04:39,496 --> 00:04:41,621
I'm getting your car wet.

10
00:04:41,696 --> 00:04:44,560
Oh, this isn't my car.
It's a drive-away.

11
00:04:44,629 --> 00:04:46,561
The owner's in San Diego.

12
00:04:51,229 --> 00:04:53,491
So where you headed?

13
00:04:57,229 --> 00:05:00,491
- You got a smoke?
- Yeah, sure.

14
00:05:13,629 --> 00:05:16,561
You gonna tell me
where you're going?

15
00:05:16,629 --> 00:05:18,288
Yeah, sure.

16
00:05:25,896 --> 00:05:27,953
What are you looking
at me like that for?

17
00:05:31,729 --> 00:05:33,319
Just looking.

18
00:05:45,629 --> 00:05:47,288
What are you doing?

19
00:05:50,863 --> 00:05:53,226
What'd you do that for?

20
00:05:56,262 --> 00:05:58,194
I asked you a question.

21
00:06:01,062 --> 00:06:02,585
Scare you?

22
00:06:12,763 --> 00:06:15,058
Look, I think you better
get out now.

23
00:06:18,329 --> 00:06:20,158
The ride's over.

24
00:06:25,296 --> 00:06:26,887
Good-bye.

25
00:06:45,596 --> 00:06:47,528
I'm gonna sit here...

26
00:06:50,763 --> 00:06:52,251
and you're gonna drive.

27
00:06:59,896 --> 00:07:01,794
Excuse me.

28
00:07:04,696 --> 00:07:08,423
- What's wrong with that car back there?
- Why?

29
00:07:08,496 --> 00:07:10,860
Thought I saw something,
that's all.

30
00:07:16,895 --> 00:07:20,623
- I ran out of gas.
- So you need a gas station?

31
00:07:20,696 --> 00:07:22,218
Would help.

32
00:07:22,296 --> 00:07:23,886
Okay.

33
00:07:38,496 --> 00:07:41,018
Gas stations have cigarettes.

34
00:07:42,763 --> 00:07:44,786
What about gas?

35
00:07:44,862 --> 00:07:47,226
I don't need gas.

36
00:07:48,929 --> 00:07:50,452
What do you want?

37
00:08:05,162 --> 00:08:07,560
What's so funny?

38
00:08:07,629 --> 00:08:10,459
That's what the other guy said.

39
00:08:10,529 --> 00:08:12,858
Who's the other guy?

40
00:08:12,929 --> 00:08:17,861
The guy who was driving that car back
there. Picked me up before you did.

41
00:08:19,196 --> 00:08:21,821
- Was that him in the car?
- I'm sure it was.

42
00:08:21,895 --> 00:08:24,361
He couldn't have walked very far.

43
00:08:28,095 --> 00:08:29,686
Why is that?

44
00:08:31,296 --> 00:08:33,353
Because I cut off his legs...

45
00:08:35,962 --> 00:08:38,053
and his arms...

46
00:08:39,596 --> 00:08:42,153
and his head.

47
00:08:44,829 --> 00:08:47,261
And I'm gonna do
the same to you.

48
00:09:13,795 --> 00:09:15,386
Don't.

49
00:09:29,095 --> 00:09:31,186
What part of Illinois you from?

50
00:09:32,329 --> 00:09:34,851
- What?
- Your license plate.

51
00:09:39,663 --> 00:09:41,595
Tell the man.

52
00:09:44,696 --> 00:09:46,059
Chicago.

53
00:09:46,129 --> 00:09:49,118
My wife's from Rockford.
You got a cigarette?

54
00:09:56,929 --> 00:10:00,861
All right, the road's clear now.
Come on. Get going, sweethearts.

55
00:10:03,529 --> 00:10:05,119
Drive.

56
00:10:31,695 --> 00:10:35,889
You want to know what happens
to an eyeball when it gets punctured?

57
00:10:38,929 --> 00:10:42,555
You got any idea how much blood jets out
of a guy's neck...

58
00:10:42,629 --> 00:10:44,821
when his throat's been slit?

59
00:10:47,429 --> 00:10:49,588
What do you want?

60
00:10:52,629 --> 00:10:54,856
I want you to stop me.

61
00:10:58,596 --> 00:11:01,221
You got the knife.

62
00:11:01,296 --> 00:11:03,761
You'll stick me with it
before I can do anything.

63
00:11:03,829 --> 00:11:07,693
That's right. So what have you
got to lose? Stop me.

64
00:11:12,929 --> 00:11:15,521
Crying isn't gonna help.

65
00:11:19,962 --> 00:11:21,894
Keep driving!

66
00:11:25,196 --> 00:11:28,560
Please. I'll do anything.

67
00:11:29,762 --> 00:11:31,490
Say four words:

68
00:11:34,229 --> 00:11:35,320
Say...

69
00:11:37,895 --> 00:11:39,827
"I want to die."

70
00:11:42,162 --> 00:11:44,094
Say what?

71
00:11:46,596 --> 00:11:48,891
"I want to die."

72
00:11:48,962 --> 00:11:50,894
Say it.

73
00:11:53,628 --> 00:11:56,788
- I don't know if I can say that.
- Sure you can.

74
00:11:56,862 --> 00:11:59,294
Repeat after me.

75
00:11:59,362 --> 00:12:01,191
"I...

76
00:12:05,329 --> 00:12:06,919
want...

77
00:12:15,429 --> 00:12:17,019
to...

78
00:12:25,329 --> 00:12:26,919
die."

79
00:12:34,162 --> 00:12:35,889
I don't want to die!

80
00:12:52,895 --> 00:12:55,884
Fuck you, buddy!

81
00:14:35,862 --> 00:14:38,260
Jesus Christ!

82
00:14:44,162 --> 00:14:47,060
Hey! Pull over!

83
00:14:52,562 --> 00:14:56,017
Pull over! The guy
in your car's a nut!

84
00:14:56,095 --> 00:14:57,424
Shoot him.

85
00:14:57,495 --> 00:15:01,053
That guy's a fucking nut
in your car! Pull over!

86
00:15:01,129 --> 00:15:04,357
- Kill him.
- That guy will kill you!

87
00:15:05,362 --> 00:15:07,351
That guy, get him
out of your car!

88
00:15:31,296 --> 00:15:34,523
Where do you think you're going?
Come back!

89
00:17:51,428 --> 00:17:53,485
Oh, fuck.

90
00:17:53,562 --> 00:17:56,028
Come on, you son of a bitch.

91
00:19:23,228 --> 00:19:26,683
Hey, stop! Stop!

92
00:19:26,762 --> 00:19:28,352
Wait!

93
00:23:39,928 --> 00:23:42,622
- Okay, see you at 4:00.
- Bye-bye.

94
00:24:33,094 --> 00:24:34,685
Shit.

95
00:24:36,695 --> 00:24:41,024
We're closed. We don't open
for another 45 minutes.

96
00:24:41,094 --> 00:24:42,754
Please, I need to use a phone!

97
00:24:42,829 --> 00:24:45,522
Sorry. I can't let you in.
We're closed.

98
00:24:45,595 --> 00:24:46,788
No! Listen.

99
00:24:46,861 --> 00:24:51,294
- Please, I have to call the cops.
- What happened?

100
00:24:51,361 --> 00:24:54,486
I can't explain right now.
I just need to use the phone.

101
00:24:57,861 --> 00:25:00,827
If Jack saw me doing this,
he'd kick my butt.

102
00:25:02,328 --> 00:25:04,885
Phone's around the corner. Go on.

103
00:25:06,328 --> 00:25:09,488
You stink of gasoline.
Were you in an accident?

104
00:25:26,094 --> 00:25:29,856
Hello, police? My name's Jim Halsey.
I know who killed those people in...

105
00:25:29,928 --> 00:25:32,190
I picked this guy up hitchhiking...

106
00:25:33,128 --> 00:25:35,060
Same guy blew up the gas station.

107
00:25:35,128 --> 00:25:39,356
Jim Halsey. H-A-L-S-E-Y.

108
00:25:40,295 --> 00:25:42,852
I'm at the Longhorn Restaurant.

109
00:25:42,928 --> 00:25:44,690
You do?

110
00:25:44,762 --> 00:25:47,852
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir. I won't go anywhere.

111
00:26:06,261 --> 00:26:07,851
Jesus.

112
00:27:05,128 --> 00:27:08,390
If you think the cops are gonna arrive
soon, you got another thing coming.

113
00:27:08,461 --> 00:27:12,154
A guy got shot in the corner
a couple months ago.

114
00:27:12,228 --> 00:27:15,955
It took them 45 minutes to get here
with the ambulance.

115
00:27:16,028 --> 00:27:18,960
By that time
the poor guy was dead.

116
00:27:21,195 --> 00:27:23,559
Specialty of the house.

117
00:27:23,628 --> 00:27:27,719
Actually the cook's not here yet.
It's the only thing I know how to make.

118
00:27:27,794 --> 00:27:30,988
Thanks.
That's real nice of you.

119
00:27:31,061 --> 00:27:33,118
Everything gonna be okay?

120
00:27:34,195 --> 00:27:35,956
I hope so.

121
00:27:36,028 --> 00:27:39,461
You sure look
a whole lot better.

122
00:27:39,528 --> 00:27:42,187
Guess it's safe for me
to smoke now, huh?

123
00:27:49,261 --> 00:27:51,692
Sorry I gave you
such a hard time, but...

124
00:27:51,828 --> 00:27:54,953
you'd be surprised the kind of trash
that passes through here.

125
00:27:56,228 --> 00:27:59,592
- How is it?
- Real good. Thanks.

126
00:27:59,661 --> 00:28:01,752
My name's Nash.

127
00:28:07,295 --> 00:28:09,726
I really appreciate this.

128
00:28:11,328 --> 00:28:14,453
- Where you from?
- Chicago.

129
00:28:14,528 --> 00:28:17,652
- Where you headed?
- California.

130
00:28:17,727 --> 00:28:20,193
How'd you know that?

131
00:28:20,261 --> 00:28:23,852
That's where everyone's going.
Hollywood?

132
00:28:23,928 --> 00:28:25,757
No. San Diego.

133
00:28:25,828 --> 00:28:28,192
I thought about moving
to California.

134
00:28:29,595 --> 00:28:32,822
Jeremy, who owns this place...
he's my cousin.

135
00:28:32,894 --> 00:28:35,826
And Uncle Jack does the cooking.

136
00:28:35,894 --> 00:28:37,826
Like that, see?

137
00:28:37,894 --> 00:28:40,554
We're all kind of interrelated.

138
00:28:41,727 --> 00:28:44,421
It's kind of hard
to just pick up and leave.

139
00:28:44,495 --> 00:28:46,790
But you never know.

140
00:28:50,562 --> 00:28:52,891
My brother Bill is from Mars.

141
00:28:52,961 --> 00:28:56,757
Actually we're all from Mars here.
We keep our spaceship out back.

142
00:28:56,828 --> 00:29:00,226
So, what planet are you from?

143
00:29:05,594 --> 00:29:07,651
What?

144
00:29:07,727 --> 00:29:10,659
You haven't heard a word
I said, have you?

145
00:29:10,727 --> 00:29:13,023
Yes, I have.

146
00:29:13,094 --> 00:29:16,185
That's okay. Go on.
Eat your cheeseburger.

147
00:29:16,261 --> 00:29:19,523
I gotta get some stuff
out of the freezer anyway.

148
00:30:07,861 --> 00:30:11,225
Stay where you are! Put your hands
in the air. Get down on the ground!

149
00:30:11,295 --> 00:30:13,022
Wait a minute!
He's in there!

150
00:30:13,094 --> 00:30:16,356
Get your ass on the cement,
or we open fire!

151
00:30:16,428 --> 00:30:18,360
I'm not gonna tell you again!

152
00:30:36,828 --> 00:30:39,760
Put your hands
behind your back slow.

153
00:31:01,594 --> 00:31:03,719
- My wallet's in my pocket.
- Shut up!

154
00:31:03,794 --> 00:31:06,056
We know how to do it.

155
00:31:22,128 --> 00:31:23,287
Jesus!

156
00:31:24,861 --> 00:31:27,918
Oh, my God! He put that there!

157
00:31:29,061 --> 00:31:31,549
Now shut up.

158
00:31:32,427 --> 00:31:34,620
Don't move.

159
00:31:37,694 --> 00:31:41,388
What's going on?
What'd you do to him?

160
00:31:43,460 --> 00:31:46,256
- You keep to yourself.
- Why you arresting him?

161
00:31:46,328 --> 00:31:50,124
Pick up that stuff.
Do you know this guy?

162
00:31:51,460 --> 00:31:52,926
Not really.

163
00:31:52,994 --> 00:31:55,459
Then what the hell
is he doing inside?

164
00:31:55,527 --> 00:31:58,392
Half the cops in the state
are looking for this creep.

165
00:31:58,460 --> 00:32:01,188
Let's get this sack of shit
out of here.

166
00:32:18,661 --> 00:32:21,287
Where's your driver's license,
your I.D.?

167
00:32:23,328 --> 00:32:25,589
Where are your credit cards?

168
00:32:27,694 --> 00:32:32,524
The guy I've been telling you about
took my wallet and planted the knife.

169
00:32:32,594 --> 00:32:34,822
My license was in my wallet.

170
00:32:34,894 --> 00:32:37,360
I don't have any credit cards.

171
00:32:41,295 --> 00:32:44,227
I suppose he took
your vehicle registration too?

172
00:32:49,295 --> 00:32:53,693
What's a young kid like you driving
such a fancy car? You steal it?

173
00:32:56,961 --> 00:32:59,518
The car doesn't belong to me.

174
00:32:59,594 --> 00:33:01,787
It's a drive-away.

175
00:33:01,861 --> 00:33:05,089
I'm supposed to be delivering it
to California.

176
00:33:05,161 --> 00:33:07,854
The guy's in San Diego.

177
00:33:09,994 --> 00:33:12,017
What's his name?

178
00:33:24,494 --> 00:33:26,085
I don't remember.

179
00:33:29,460 --> 00:33:33,586
But I know the number of the drive-away
company. Why don't you call them?

180
00:33:33,661 --> 00:33:37,525
Hell, son. You better start calling
somebody 'cause you're in deep shit.

181
00:33:37,594 --> 00:33:41,390
It's 312-399-2090.

182
00:33:41,460 --> 00:33:45,154
I know the number so well
because I called them so many times.

183
00:33:45,228 --> 00:33:47,659
I was on their waiting list
for a month.

184
00:33:47,727 --> 00:33:50,716
I wanted a car going
to California.

185
00:33:50,794 --> 00:33:52,726
That's why it took so long.

186
00:33:52,794 --> 00:33:55,885
Thank you for calling
Midwest Drive-away.

187
00:33:55,961 --> 00:33:59,552
Our Chicago office hours are
9:00 to 5:00, Monday through Friday.

188
00:33:59,627 --> 00:34:01,616
Closed Saturday and...

189
00:34:01,694 --> 00:34:05,127
Well, now what are we gonna do?

190
00:34:05,195 --> 00:34:07,319
You got one more call.

191
00:34:07,394 --> 00:34:11,952
Call my brother, for God's sakes!
He'll be home.

192
00:34:12,028 --> 00:34:14,357
It's 312-905-9044.

193
00:34:37,128 --> 00:34:39,593
Maybe you didn't let it
ring long enough.

194
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:45,826
Do I look like a killer to you?

195
00:34:51,894 --> 00:34:55,656
Folks coming in from Austin tomorrow
gonna be interested in talking to you.

196
00:34:55,727 --> 00:34:58,716
I'm gonna give you a chance
to get some rest.

197
00:34:58,794 --> 00:35:01,885
Get him locked up.
Get him out of my sight.

198
00:35:05,094 --> 00:35:06,457
Let's go.

199
00:35:08,828 --> 00:35:10,987
Jack?

200
00:35:11,061 --> 00:35:14,322
That kid isn't a killer.
Any fool could see that.

201
00:35:16,594 --> 00:35:19,060
Okay, face front.

202
00:35:19,128 --> 00:35:21,185
Hold real still.

203
00:35:22,761 --> 00:35:24,693
Now turn to your right.

204
00:35:26,061 --> 00:35:27,651
Steady.

205
00:35:27,727 --> 00:35:29,818
Make it your left.

206
00:35:33,028 --> 00:35:36,687
Oh, those are real good.
Your mama's gonna like those.

207
00:35:39,594 --> 00:35:40,992
Let's go.

208
00:36:07,061 --> 00:36:09,458
You behave yourself now.

209
00:38:23,661 --> 00:38:25,251
Hello?

210
00:41:12,527 --> 00:41:15,459
Go! I'm right behind you.
Come on!

211
00:41:25,627 --> 00:41:27,456
Let's go.

212
00:42:54,394 --> 00:42:56,519
Come on, come on.

213
00:42:59,194 --> 00:43:00,524
Stop!

214
00:43:00,594 --> 00:43:02,560
- Take her easy!
- Tell me about it.

215
00:43:03,661 --> 00:43:05,718
Get over by the car.

216
00:43:11,093 --> 00:43:13,321
Those cuffs on your belt...

217
00:43:13,394 --> 00:43:16,155
take them off and lock
your partner's hands behind his back.

218
00:43:16,227 --> 00:43:18,659
- You mean me?
- I mean you.

219
00:43:18,726 --> 00:43:20,716
You! Yes, you!

220
00:43:25,027 --> 00:43:28,255
Okay. We're gonna go
for a little ride now.

221
00:43:28,327 --> 00:43:31,157
You two get in the front.
I'll get in the back.

222
00:43:32,460 --> 00:43:35,857
- One of you open the door.
- Open the door, Jack.

223
00:43:39,694 --> 00:43:41,626
Get in the car!

224
00:43:42,726 --> 00:43:46,352
You and me, we're gonna
get in together, okay?

225
00:43:50,260 --> 00:43:52,658
Ready...

226
00:43:52,726 --> 00:43:54,317
steady...

227
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:57,351
go.

228
00:44:04,360 --> 00:44:08,053
- Can I close the door?
- Shut the door.

229
00:44:09,194 --> 00:44:11,126
Start the car.

230
00:44:13,494 --> 00:44:15,755
Head for the highway.

231
00:44:33,660 --> 00:44:37,649
Can you call out on that thing and get
me connected with somebody in charge?

232
00:44:37,726 --> 00:44:41,284
I'll try to get through
to Captain Esteridge.

233
00:44:41,360 --> 00:44:45,383
Do it. But don't tell anybody
where we are.

234
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:51,217
- Central, this is car number...
- I said don't tell them anything.

235
00:44:54,527 --> 00:44:58,550
Central, this is one of your cars
and we've been hijacked by suspect.

236
00:45:00,626 --> 00:45:03,888
He wishes to speak
to Captain Esteridge directly. Over.

237
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:07,755
Esteridge 10-11.
We'll try to locate. Standby.

238
00:45:07,827 --> 00:45:10,191
10-12, El Paso. Clear.

239
00:45:19,860 --> 00:45:22,951
This is Captain Esteridge.
Do you read? Over.

240
00:45:28,860 --> 00:45:31,349
Captain, this is Jim Halsey.

241
00:45:31,427 --> 00:45:35,825
You gotta listen to me, Captain.
I swear I didn't kill those people.

242
00:45:35,893 --> 00:45:39,087
I got framed by this guy
I picked up hitchhiking.

243
00:45:39,160 --> 00:45:41,149
What do you suggest
we do, son?

244
00:45:41,227 --> 00:45:44,022
Come on, man. You tell me.

245
00:45:44,093 --> 00:45:46,059
Why don't you
stop things right now...

246
00:45:46,127 --> 00:45:49,615
let my men go
and give yourself up?

247
00:45:49,693 --> 00:45:51,716
I don't have identification.

248
00:45:51,827 --> 00:45:54,952
I don't have anybody to call
for you to check me out.

249
00:45:55,027 --> 00:45:57,993
Are you willing to lay down
your arms and surrender?

250
00:45:58,060 --> 00:46:02,516
I promise I'll do everything in my power
to see to it you're treated fairly.

251
00:46:08,327 --> 00:46:11,020
I'm putting my trust in you, Captain.

252
00:46:12,593 --> 00:46:14,957
Take us in.

253
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:25,351
Bang.

254
00:48:47,426 --> 00:48:49,359
Well, I know
you caught something...

255
00:48:49,426 --> 00:48:53,325
because you're probably
the best dang fisherman around here.

256
00:48:53,393 --> 00:48:56,019
But if that's the best
you can eat...

257
00:48:56,093 --> 00:48:58,752
I don't know what you're
gonna be able to do.

258
00:48:58,827 --> 00:49:01,123
That'll tide us over until...

259
00:49:01,194 --> 00:49:03,319
Looks to me like you best go.

260
00:49:03,393 --> 00:49:06,757
- Better get on the road.
- Yeah, I'll see you.

261
00:49:06,827 --> 00:49:09,191
Bye, Alice.

262
00:49:09,260 --> 00:49:11,192
Well, what happened to you?

263
00:49:11,260 --> 00:49:13,351
Nothing.

264
00:49:14,360 --> 00:49:15,689
Nothing?

265
00:49:15,760 --> 00:49:17,692
Nothing happened.

266
00:49:21,560 --> 00:49:24,993
- I need some coffee.
- It's brewing.

267
00:49:28,194 --> 00:49:31,682
- Bring it to me at one of the booths.
- You okay, kid?

268
00:50:10,726 --> 00:50:12,215
How do you like Shitsville?

269
00:50:18,093 --> 00:50:19,956
Don't you move.

270
00:50:21,426 --> 00:50:23,551
You stay seated
right where you are...

271
00:50:25,426 --> 00:50:27,858
or I'll blow your brains
through your ass.

272
00:50:32,326 --> 00:50:33,917
The gun is empty.

273
00:50:47,093 --> 00:50:49,354
You never checked it,
did you?

274
00:50:49,426 --> 00:50:52,483
So help me,
I'll blow you in half.

275
00:50:54,560 --> 00:50:56,788
All right.
Squeeze the trigger.

276
00:50:56,860 --> 00:50:59,019
I will.

277
00:50:59,093 --> 00:51:01,786
- Please.
- Oh, I will.

278
00:51:01,860 --> 00:51:06,588
'Cause you can sure as shit bet
I'm gonna squeeze mine.

279
00:51:11,993 --> 00:51:13,515
Bam!

280
00:51:27,993 --> 00:51:30,118
Why are you doing this to me?

281
00:51:38,426 --> 00:51:40,017
Come here.

282
00:51:59,827 --> 00:52:02,191
You're a smart kid.

283
00:52:03,526 --> 00:52:05,458
Figure it out.

284
00:55:36,159 --> 00:55:39,683
I didn't do it.
I didn't do any of it.

285
00:55:41,092 --> 00:55:43,650
I'm not gonna shoot anybody.

286
00:55:43,726 --> 00:55:45,658
I'm not a killer.

287
00:55:49,092 --> 00:55:51,524
This morning this guy
tried to kill me.

288
00:55:51,593 --> 00:55:53,786
He's been following me
ever since.

289
00:55:53,860 --> 00:55:56,018
I don't know why.

290
00:55:59,259 --> 00:56:01,885
Do you believe me?

291
00:56:03,927 --> 00:56:05,790
Sure.

292
00:56:09,860 --> 00:56:12,189
No, you don't.

293
00:56:12,259 --> 00:56:14,521
I wouldn't either.

294
00:56:17,693 --> 00:56:20,454
Let's go sit down.

295
00:56:49,326 --> 00:56:51,588
What are you gonna do?

296
00:56:54,626 --> 00:56:56,216
Give up.

297
00:56:57,926 --> 00:56:59,392
I have no choice.

298
00:57:22,359 --> 00:57:25,291
Nice and easy. Come on.

299
00:57:25,359 --> 00:57:26,552
Step down.

300
00:57:29,693 --> 00:57:31,954
All right, step down.

301
00:57:36,459 --> 00:57:38,857
I'm turning myself in.

302
00:57:40,159 --> 00:57:44,023
Get out from behind the door!
Step away from the bus. Get down!

303
00:57:44,092 --> 00:57:45,718
Move!

304
00:57:45,793 --> 00:57:48,691
Move your ass now!

305
00:57:49,660 --> 00:57:52,558
I'm giving up
and I'm not guilty.

306
00:57:58,226 --> 00:58:00,522
You just wasted
two of my friends.

307
00:58:05,359 --> 00:58:09,689
- You spit on my wrist.
- What?

308
00:58:09,760 --> 00:58:12,521
I said, "You spit on my wrist."

309
00:58:12,593 --> 00:58:14,956
Wipe it off.

310
00:58:16,760 --> 00:58:18,385
You can see I'm unarmed.

311
00:58:18,459 --> 00:58:20,288
Wipe it off!

312
00:58:20,359 --> 00:58:22,621
- Come on, Lyle. Go easy.
- Shut up!

313
00:58:22,693 --> 00:58:25,056
- Let's get him back to the station.
- I said, "Shut up!"

314
00:58:26,059 --> 00:58:27,582
Wipe it off!

315
00:58:27,660 --> 00:58:29,717
Put the gun down.

316
00:58:33,892 --> 00:58:36,222
Goddamn you.

317
00:58:37,459 --> 00:58:40,721
Drop your guns! Don't turn around.
Just drop them.

318
00:58:43,393 --> 00:58:46,553
I can't believe you were gonna do
what you were gonna do.

319
00:58:47,792 --> 00:58:49,725
Don't you know who he is?

320
00:58:49,792 --> 00:58:52,350
You got the wrong man, Lyle.

321
00:58:54,560 --> 00:58:57,219
Like hell we do.
Now just settle down and...

322
00:58:57,293 --> 00:59:00,691
- Don't come any closer.
- Hand me that gun.

323
00:59:05,259 --> 00:59:08,657
Just empty them.
You're in enough trouble already.

324
00:59:08,726 --> 00:59:11,089
You just threw your life
down the toilet, girl.

325
00:59:11,159 --> 00:59:15,023
When the truth comes down,
I'll be just fine.

326
00:59:15,092 --> 00:59:18,286
I'm taking him to
the sheriff's office in Riley.

327
00:59:18,359 --> 00:59:19,620
You stay put.

328
00:59:21,293 --> 00:59:23,020
Let's go.

329
00:59:47,359 --> 00:59:50,291
- Now what?
- We're going to Riley.

330
01:00:01,826 --> 01:00:05,486
- Do you know how to use the radio?
- I better let you out here.

331
01:00:05,560 --> 01:00:08,253
No. If I'm in the car with you,
they're not gonna hurt you.

332
01:00:08,326 --> 01:00:11,053
- We can talk to them by radio.
- What are you gonna say?

333
01:00:11,126 --> 01:00:12,989
We're gonna turn ourselves in.

334
01:00:18,926 --> 01:00:21,392
Buckle your seat belt.

335
01:00:21,459 --> 01:00:23,049
Do mine.

336
01:00:34,426 --> 01:00:38,153
Hello? Can you read me?
We want to turn ourselves in.

337
01:00:38,226 --> 01:00:41,283
We're turning ourselves in.
Can you read me? Over.

338
01:00:47,226 --> 01:00:51,181
Listen to me this time.
We are turning ourselves in.

339
01:00:52,493 --> 01:00:56,323
We just want to turn ourselves in!
Do you read me?

340
01:00:56,393 --> 01:00:58,325
Hello!

341
01:00:58,393 --> 01:01:00,450
The bastard's on his way.

342
01:01:02,459 --> 01:01:04,856
Hold it there.
That's a good speed.

343
01:01:05,959 --> 01:01:07,050
Shit.

344
01:01:12,393 --> 01:01:15,950
Get the gun! Use it!

345
01:01:16,026 --> 01:01:19,288
- No, I'm not gonna shoot anybody!
- Aim for the tire.

346
01:01:20,193 --> 01:01:23,057
- Oh, God!
- They're gonna kill us!

347
01:01:27,126 --> 01:01:29,717
- Use it! Shoot 'em!
- No!

348
01:01:36,393 --> 01:01:37,881
I got you.

349
01:01:37,959 --> 01:01:39,652
Jesus Christ! Use the gun!

350
01:01:45,560 --> 01:01:47,150
Shoot back!

351
01:01:51,826 --> 01:01:54,384
You got him. Watch it.

352
01:01:54,459 --> 01:01:57,118
She's got a gun.
Watch it. Get down.

353
01:01:58,059 --> 01:02:01,025
You got him.

354
01:02:02,826 --> 01:02:04,122
I dropped the gun.

355
01:02:05,259 --> 01:02:07,191
You what?

356
01:02:19,959 --> 01:02:21,788
Get the shotgun!

357
01:02:37,725 --> 01:02:39,850
Be careful, now.

358
01:02:40,926 --> 01:02:42,483
There you go.

359
01:02:44,792 --> 01:02:45,883
Hold on!

360
01:02:47,725 --> 01:02:49,816
Holy shit!

361
01:03:15,959 --> 01:03:18,517
Are you okay?

362
01:03:18,592 --> 01:03:21,184
Yeah. Yeah, I'm okay.

363
01:03:32,393 --> 01:03:35,223
1073, 221, are you okay?

364
01:04:35,692 --> 01:04:37,783
Let's go, you son of a bitch!

365
01:05:09,425 --> 01:05:10,686
Oh, God.

366
01:06:50,159 --> 01:06:52,681
Come on.
Let's get out of here.

367
01:06:57,992 --> 01:07:00,924
- Why didn't he kill us?
- Let's go.

368
01:07:03,892 --> 01:07:05,949
Why didn't he kill us?

369
01:07:09,759 --> 01:07:11,349
Let's go.

370
01:08:16,092 --> 01:08:17,489
Are you okay?

371
01:08:23,126 --> 01:08:25,853
Why'd you pick him up?

372
01:08:31,292 --> 01:08:33,520
I wanted to help him...

373
01:08:34,759 --> 01:08:37,554
and I was tired.

374
01:08:37,625 --> 01:08:40,523
I thought he'd
help me stay awake.

375
01:08:43,559 --> 01:08:46,025
Can I sit by you?

376
01:08:58,759 --> 01:09:01,190
- What are you doing?
- I want to call my father.

377
01:09:01,258 --> 01:09:03,690
- No. No calls.
- It's only my father.

378
01:09:03,759 --> 01:09:05,452
I said, no calls.

379
01:09:06,525 --> 01:09:09,457
Not until we figure out
what we're gonna do.

380
01:09:09,525 --> 01:09:11,718
I can explain it.

381
01:09:11,792 --> 01:09:14,020
It's not that simple.

382
01:09:16,559 --> 01:09:18,491
I already tried.

383
01:09:20,559 --> 01:09:22,491
I'm scared.

384
01:09:26,392 --> 01:09:27,722
Me too.

385
01:09:42,258 --> 01:09:43,849
Thanks.

386
01:10:26,425 --> 01:10:27,857
Nash?

387
01:10:31,158 --> 01:10:33,090
Are you awake?

388
01:11:05,425 --> 01:11:07,357
Let's head 'em out!

389
01:11:53,692 --> 01:11:56,522
No, I'm okay. Don't...

390
01:11:58,358 --> 01:12:00,517
I'm okay.

391
01:12:02,826 --> 01:12:05,519
I just want you
to know where I am.

392
01:12:15,725 --> 01:12:18,850
Everybody's
got this whole thing wrong.

393
01:12:20,258 --> 01:12:23,224
No, I sound funny,
but I'm okay.

394
01:14:21,592 --> 01:14:23,955
The Apostle Paul told us
to look within ourselves...

395
01:14:24,025 --> 01:14:26,082
for the very spirit of faith.

396
01:14:26,158 --> 01:14:29,124
You must look to nature where
the spirit is replenished daily.

397
01:14:29,192 --> 01:14:32,851
I'm Reverend Hollis Maxwell inviting you
to visit a church this Sunday.

398
01:14:34,025 --> 01:14:37,480
This is Channel 3,
KCIK Television, in Texas...

399
01:14:37,559 --> 01:14:39,821
licensed by the F.C.C.
in Washington, D. C...

400
01:14:39,891 --> 01:14:41,824
ending its broadcast day.

401
01:14:41,891 --> 01:14:44,687
We invite you to join us
tomorrow at 6:00 A.M.

402
01:16:10,458 --> 01:16:12,583
All right.
Don't hurt him, Ed.

403
01:16:12,659 --> 01:16:14,851
You take it easy now.
Are you Jim Halsey?

404
01:16:14,925 --> 01:16:17,414
- Who are you?
- I'm Captain Esteridge.

405
01:16:17,492 --> 01:16:20,049
We spoke on the radio.

406
01:16:20,125 --> 01:16:22,182
Where is she?

407
01:16:22,258 --> 01:16:26,054
You come along with us now.
We're gonna need your help.

408
01:16:35,692 --> 01:16:38,782
Hostage situation.

409
01:16:38,858 --> 01:16:40,790
Hold your fire.

410
01:16:47,258 --> 01:16:49,019
Hold it!

411
01:16:49,091 --> 01:16:50,954
Please, don't!

412
01:16:51,025 --> 01:16:53,820
Why don't you do something?
Fuckin' do something!

413
01:16:53,891 --> 01:16:55,619
We can't!

414
01:16:57,091 --> 01:16:58,489
Hold it!

415
01:17:05,091 --> 01:17:07,057
- No!
- Do something!

416
01:17:07,125 --> 01:17:10,455
If we shoot him, his foot will come off
that clutch, and that truck will roll.

417
01:17:14,891 --> 01:17:16,221
Please!

418
01:17:16,292 --> 01:17:20,384
Now, you get in there
and you see what you can do.

419
01:17:22,925 --> 01:17:24,482
Please, do something!

420
01:17:24,559 --> 01:17:27,423
Please, help!

421
01:18:11,258 --> 01:18:13,815
She's sweet.

422
01:18:21,025 --> 01:18:23,048
The gun is loaded.

423
01:18:25,125 --> 01:18:27,182
Go for it.

424
01:18:27,258 --> 01:18:29,520
Go ahead. Pick it up.

425
01:18:34,425 --> 01:18:39,153
Tell you what... I'll let you hold
the gun on me before I do anything.

426
01:18:40,925 --> 01:18:42,391
They'll catch you.

427
01:18:42,458 --> 01:18:44,390
Please!

428
01:18:44,458 --> 01:18:47,185
Yeah. Sure.

429
01:18:48,891 --> 01:18:50,823
So what?

430
01:18:57,525 --> 01:19:00,047
Pick up the gun.

431
01:19:03,492 --> 01:19:05,151
Do something!

432
01:19:06,158 --> 01:19:08,181
Put it in my face.

433
01:19:09,758 --> 01:19:10,849
Right there.

434
01:19:15,125 --> 01:19:17,387
That's good.

435
01:19:17,458 --> 01:19:19,424
You know what to do.

436
01:19:19,492 --> 01:19:21,549
Now do it.

437
01:19:22,658 --> 01:19:25,022
Squeeze the trigger.

438
01:19:31,492 --> 01:19:33,424
She'll die.

439
01:19:46,225 --> 01:19:50,055
Oh, God.

440
01:19:56,492 --> 01:19:58,684
You useless...

441
01:20:00,458 --> 01:20:01,718
waste.

442
01:20:24,691 --> 01:20:28,089
I can't tell you
how sorry I am for you, son.

443
01:20:34,125 --> 01:20:36,522
Anything I can do for you?

444
01:20:41,524 --> 01:20:44,082
When you're finished here,
you should go see a real doctor...

445
01:20:44,158 --> 01:20:46,351
and get a complete checkup.

446
01:20:48,591 --> 01:20:51,023
We all know there
was nothing you could do.

447
01:21:01,591 --> 01:21:04,422
- Who is he?
- We don't know.

448
01:21:04,491 --> 01:21:07,287
No prison record,
no driver's license...

449
01:21:07,358 --> 01:21:10,188
no birth certificate.

450
01:21:10,258 --> 01:21:13,019
We ran his prints
through the computers...

451
01:21:13,091 --> 01:21:16,251
and we came up with nothin'.

452
01:21:16,325 --> 01:21:20,348
I know we'll find something, but
right now, I don't even know his name.

453
01:21:26,791 --> 01:21:28,723
How do you feel?

454
01:21:32,358 --> 01:21:33,789
Tired.

455
01:21:35,292 --> 01:21:38,019
He can't see us or hear us.

456
01:21:41,491 --> 01:21:43,514
I want to talk to him.

457
01:21:43,591 --> 01:21:46,183
What's your name?

458
01:21:47,758 --> 01:21:49,190
Come on.

459
01:21:52,125 --> 01:21:55,522
Come on.
What's your name?

460
01:22:00,258 --> 01:22:02,019
Do you have a name?

461
01:22:02,091 --> 01:22:04,023
John Ryder.

462
01:22:10,225 --> 01:22:11,952
What'd you say?

463
01:22:13,991 --> 01:22:16,287
His name is John Ryder.

464
01:22:17,424 --> 01:22:20,016
Do you have a police record?

465
01:22:24,724 --> 01:22:26,656
Where are you from?

466
01:22:30,225 --> 01:22:31,884
Disneyland.

467
01:22:34,457 --> 01:22:36,855
How long do we
have to play this game?

468
01:22:36,925 --> 01:22:38,857
Y'all give me a minute?

469
01:22:43,357 --> 01:22:45,290
Come on.

470
01:23:31,925 --> 01:23:36,221
All right, that's enough of that.
It was a bad idea in the first place.

471
01:24:28,457 --> 01:24:32,287
Captain Esteridge,
is it true that...

472
01:24:32,357 --> 01:24:34,289
No comment.

473
01:24:57,192 --> 01:24:59,124
All right, son.
Get in the car.

474
01:26:11,025 --> 01:26:12,957
Are you okay?

475
01:26:18,991 --> 01:26:20,718
You'll never hold him.

476
01:26:22,457 --> 01:26:26,287
All right, you listen up now,
and you listen good, son.

477
01:26:26,357 --> 01:26:30,517
There's something strange between you.
I don't want to know what it is.

478
01:26:30,591 --> 01:26:33,352
But I'm telling you,
he is in our hands now...

479
01:26:35,257 --> 01:26:38,053
and whatever happens to him,
it won't be decided by you.

480
01:26:38,124 --> 01:26:41,682
It doesn't have anything
to do with you anymore.

481
01:26:43,658 --> 01:26:45,851
Okay?

482
01:27:04,424 --> 01:27:07,185
Can I have one of your cigarettes?

483
01:27:07,257 --> 01:27:09,053
Sure.

484
01:27:15,324 --> 01:27:17,256
Stop the car.

485
01:27:20,758 --> 01:27:23,189
You're not gonna use that thing.

486
01:27:26,424 --> 01:27:29,618
Stop the car,
and don't do anything stupid.

487
01:27:43,491 --> 01:27:46,685
All right.
What's on your mind?

488
01:27:49,424 --> 01:27:50,856
Get out.

489
01:27:53,025 --> 01:27:54,957
You're gonna get yourself killed.

490
01:27:55,025 --> 01:27:58,513
And if you don't, you're gonna be
in a whole lot of trouble.

491
01:28:01,357 --> 01:28:03,289
I'm sorry, sir.

492
01:28:04,991 --> 01:28:08,354
- It's something I gotta do.
- You don't know what you're doin'.

493
01:28:09,524 --> 01:28:11,456
Yeah...

494
01:28:11,524 --> 01:28:13,683
I do.

495
01:30:04,257 --> 01:30:06,621
Hi, kid.

496
01:31:24,024 --> 01:31:25,956
Come on.

497
01:31:57,957 --> 01:31:59,184
Come on!

498
01:37:09,490 --> 01:37:13,423
