1
00:00:58,316 --> 00:01:00,307
<i>Emily!</i>

2
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:04,638
You're the medical examiner?

3
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:30,491
Mr. Rose?

4
00:04:28,393 --> 00:04:29,690
I'm sorry, Mr. Rose...

5
00:04:31,896 --> 00:04:34,330
...but I cannot state conclusively...

6
00:04:34,532 --> 00:04:39,469
...that the cause of death
was natural.

7
00:04:40,605 --> 00:04:42,903
Your daughter, she...

8
00:04:57,255 --> 00:04:59,246
Excuse me, Father?

9
00:05:00,091 --> 00:05:01,956
Father Moore.

10
00:05:03,361 --> 00:05:04,658
You'll have to come with me.

11
00:05:14,138 --> 00:05:16,606
- Father Moore!
- Will you plead guilty?

12
00:05:16,808 --> 00:05:19,368
- Tell us about the exorcism!
- Over here, Father Moore!

13
00:05:19,577 --> 00:05:22,774
We're at Crescent County Courthouse.
We show you Father Richard Moore...

14
00:05:22,981 --> 00:05:25,609
- <i>What about the parents?</i>
- <i>They're not talking to the police.</i>

15
00:05:25,817 --> 00:05:26,943
<i>Do we charge them?</i>

16
00:05:27,151 --> 00:05:29,346
<i>No. Even the priest admits</i>
<i>he ran the show.</i>

17
00:05:29,554 --> 00:05:31,181
<i>We need a Christian on this.</i>

18
00:05:31,389 --> 00:05:32,583
Preferably a Catholic.

19
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:34,849
Somebody that knows this shit
inside out...

20
00:05:35,059 --> 00:05:38,028
...and who the public will see
as unbiased.

21
00:05:39,030 --> 00:05:41,294
We're going after a holy man here.

22
00:05:42,533 --> 00:05:44,160
Ethan Thomas.

23
00:05:45,203 --> 00:05:48,798
He's not Catholic, though.
Methodist, I think.

24
00:05:49,007 --> 00:05:52,465
But the guy practically lives at church.
Choir, teaches Sunday school.

25
00:05:52,677 --> 00:05:55,805
He's no choirboy in the courtroom.
I've seen him tear people up.

26
00:05:56,147 --> 00:05:58,115
He's a shrewd son of a bitch.

27
00:06:01,986 --> 00:06:05,717
All right, pull him off whatever
he's doing. He's lead prosecutor.

28
00:06:26,644 --> 00:06:30,410
There's ambition. She never stops.
She even works while she drinks.

29
00:06:30,615 --> 00:06:32,606
- Gentlemen, you know Erin Bruner.
- Of course.

30
00:06:32,817 --> 00:06:35,081
- Hello.
- I was so sure Van Hopper would fry...

31
00:06:35,286 --> 00:06:38,016
...but you proved me wrong, lady.

32
00:06:38,222 --> 00:06:39,519
The system worked, that's all.

33
00:06:40,958 --> 00:06:43,449
Gentlemen, you'll excuse us,
will you?

34
00:06:43,961 --> 00:06:45,724
Have you seen the news
about this priest?

35
00:06:45,930 --> 00:06:49,559
I heard something about an exorcism
gone bad, but I don't know the details.

36
00:06:49,767 --> 00:06:52,167
The DA charged him
with negligent homicide.

37
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:55,771
They offered a very reasonable plea
bargain, but the priest turned it down.

38
00:06:55,973 --> 00:06:57,167
Do not ask me to take this...

39
00:06:57,375 --> 00:07:00,606
The archdiocese
specifically requested you.

40
00:07:01,279 --> 00:07:04,407
- Why me?
- They followed the Van Hopper trial.

41
00:07:04,615 --> 00:07:06,207
They think you're smart...

42
00:07:06,417 --> 00:07:07,816
...and convincing.

43
00:07:08,386 --> 00:07:10,479
They want you to ask the priest
to reconsider.

44
00:07:10,688 --> 00:07:11,882
Well, what if he won't?

45
00:07:12,090 --> 00:07:15,025
This sounds like a quagmire.
If I'm smart, I'll leave it alone.

46
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:19,323
Erin, the Van Hopper case
got you back on the fast track.

47
00:07:19,530 --> 00:07:21,521
Once again, you're a rising star.

48
00:07:21,733 --> 00:07:25,294
- Chivas, neat, please.
- Tanqueray martini, dry.

49
00:07:26,371 --> 00:07:28,839
- What are you saying?
- I'm saying, you do this for me...

50
00:07:29,307 --> 00:07:32,037
...and the rising star keeps rising.

51
00:07:32,243 --> 00:07:33,471
The case is yours.

52
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:39,181
And just how high
do I get to rise this time?

53
00:07:41,452 --> 00:07:43,750
I've been junior partner
for too long now, Karl.

54
00:07:43,955 --> 00:07:46,116
- It's not like other firms haven't called.
- Erin...

55
00:07:46,324 --> 00:07:50,192
I want my name on the door,
right next to yours.

56
00:07:53,164 --> 00:07:54,756
Okay.

57
00:07:54,966 --> 00:07:56,160
Try to get the deal.

58
00:07:56,567 --> 00:07:58,558
If the priest won't
and this goes to trial...

59
00:07:58,770 --> 00:08:01,238
...the archdiocese feels he could
be an embarrassment.

60
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:03,339
So under no circumstances
is he to testify.

61
00:08:03,541 --> 00:08:05,907
No, of course.
If I'd put Van Hopper on the stand...

62
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:10,103
...he'd be marking time on death row
instead of sunbathing in Miami.

63
00:08:10,314 --> 00:08:11,679
His tab.

64
00:08:36,974 --> 00:08:39,272
Good morning, I'm Erin Bruner.

65
00:08:40,378 --> 00:08:41,902
May I sit down?

66
00:08:43,648 --> 00:08:46,981
They brought the chair
for my public defender.

67
00:08:48,486 --> 00:08:52,946
I guess they left it when they decided
I wasn't going to kill myself with it.

68
00:09:01,632 --> 00:09:04,533
My firm represents the archdiocese.

69
00:09:06,237 --> 00:09:07,534
Yes.

70
00:09:08,039 --> 00:09:11,202
Yes, I was expecting them
to send someone.

71
00:09:12,243 --> 00:09:14,973
- Why did they choose you?
- I wanted this case.

72
00:09:15,179 --> 00:09:18,615
- So you like the spotlight?
- I'm used to it.

73
00:09:18,816 --> 00:09:20,340
I defended James Van Hopper.

74
00:09:20,918 --> 00:09:22,977
And now you've come
to further your celebrity.

75
00:09:23,187 --> 00:09:24,415
No.

76
00:09:25,756 --> 00:09:27,747
I'm here to make senior partner
at my firm.

77
00:09:30,862 --> 00:09:33,524
- Are you a Catholic?
- No.

78
00:09:33,731 --> 00:09:37,030
I'm an agnostic, I guess.
I'm not really sure.

79
00:09:37,235 --> 00:09:39,032
If you're not sure, then you are one.

80
00:09:41,138 --> 00:09:44,665
I don't think you're the right attorney.
I'll stick with my public defender.

81
00:09:44,876 --> 00:09:47,344
He can't get the DA
to get you a better deal. I can.

82
00:09:47,545 --> 00:09:49,376
I won't be making
any plea agreement.

83
00:09:49,614 --> 00:09:51,844
If you don't, the archdiocese
won't post your bail.

84
00:09:52,049 --> 00:09:54,108
You'll be stuck in here for the trial.

85
00:09:57,054 --> 00:09:59,284
Do you understand how long
they can put you away?

86
00:09:59,490 --> 00:10:00,684
It's been explained to me.

87
00:10:00,892 --> 00:10:04,328
The DA's office doesn't like it when
religion holds itself above the law.

88
00:10:04,529 --> 00:10:06,087
And this prosecutor,
Ethan Thomas?

89
00:10:06,297 --> 00:10:09,095
You're gonna need somebody
hungry and smart...

90
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:11,063
...and aggressive
to even have a chance.

91
00:10:11,269 --> 00:10:14,796
What would your strategy be to defend
me against such a formidable man?

92
00:10:15,239 --> 00:10:17,434
- That depends.
- On what?

93
00:10:17,642 --> 00:10:18,973
On how you wanna be defended.

94
00:10:23,748 --> 00:10:27,149
What's your main concern,
other than staying out of jail?

95
00:10:27,351 --> 00:10:30,809
- Is it how you're being portrayed?
- I don't care about my reputation.

96
00:10:31,022 --> 00:10:32,853
I'm not afraid of jail.

97
00:10:35,393 --> 00:10:38,726
What I care about
is telling Emily Rose's story.

98
00:10:39,897 --> 00:10:42,365
I want people to hear
what only I can tell.

99
00:10:42,567 --> 00:10:44,228
And what is that?

100
00:10:44,435 --> 00:10:45,993
What really happened to Emily...

101
00:10:46,203 --> 00:10:48,103
...and why.

102
00:10:51,542 --> 00:10:53,737
If I let you defend me...

103
00:10:53,945 --> 00:10:57,938
...will you promise to let me testify and
tell the truth about what happened?

104
00:10:58,749 --> 00:11:03,277
And what is the truth you would tell?
That the ritual killed her?

105
00:11:03,888 --> 00:11:05,947
- Was it your fault she died?
- No.

106
00:11:06,157 --> 00:11:08,216
All right.
Then I'll let you tell her story.

107
00:11:08,426 --> 00:11:12,123
But only if you agree to let me do
whatever else it takes to win.

108
00:11:30,982 --> 00:11:33,974
You're not used to
this kind of place.

109
00:11:34,785 --> 00:11:38,448
I'm sure our life is very strange
to you.

110
00:11:40,191 --> 00:11:42,182
Not so strange.

111
00:11:43,427 --> 00:11:45,827
I grew up in a little town.

112
00:11:46,030 --> 00:11:48,794
But our house wasn't as nice
or as big as this.

113
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,968
My mother, she raised me alone.

114
00:11:51,168 --> 00:11:54,035
She was a schoolteacher,
so we had very little money.

115
00:11:54,238 --> 00:11:56,468
What a wonderful thing to be.

116
00:11:57,274 --> 00:12:00,266
That was Emily's dream,
to be a teacher.

117
00:12:00,745 --> 00:12:04,146
That's why she went away
to the university.

118
00:12:11,522 --> 00:12:13,581
A lot of cats live here.

119
00:12:15,059 --> 00:12:17,186
There are...

120
00:12:17,395 --> 00:12:20,057
...11 now, I think.

121
00:12:20,264 --> 00:12:21,754
Emily always brought them home.

122
00:12:21,966 --> 00:12:26,733
Ever since she was a little girl,
she couldn't leave a stray abandoned.

123
00:12:30,508 --> 00:12:32,840
Before these troubles began...

124
00:12:33,044 --> 00:12:34,375
...was Emily a happy girl?

125
00:12:35,046 --> 00:12:36,536
Oh, yes.

126
00:12:37,481 --> 00:12:39,972
Before she went away
to university...

127
00:12:40,184 --> 00:12:42,982
...my Emily was so very happy.

128
00:12:45,022 --> 00:12:47,991
What is going on...? Girls!

129
00:12:51,128 --> 00:12:52,959
Mama.

130
00:12:54,999 --> 00:12:56,432
Is it...?

131
00:12:57,835 --> 00:12:59,234
It's a scholarship, Mama.

132
00:13:00,671 --> 00:13:03,401
They pay for it.
They pay for everything.

133
00:13:04,442 --> 00:13:05,875
This is your dream, Emily.

134
00:13:07,912 --> 00:13:09,641
You'll be leaving us.

135
00:13:11,048 --> 00:13:12,743
It's okay.

136
00:13:14,885 --> 00:13:16,750
I'll be okay.

137
00:13:17,455 --> 00:13:19,889
I'm gonna show this to your father.

138
00:13:28,032 --> 00:13:31,399
- Counselor. Thanks for meeting me.
- Sure.

139
00:13:32,903 --> 00:13:35,804
Can I buy you a drink, Mr. Thomas?
He makes an excellent martini.

140
00:13:36,006 --> 00:13:37,906
Just water for me, please.

141
00:13:38,509 --> 00:13:39,908
So...

142
00:13:40,111 --> 00:13:42,909
...the judge thinks we should offer
a new plea agreement.

143
00:13:43,881 --> 00:13:47,248
She feels the community might be
better served without this trial.

144
00:13:47,451 --> 00:13:49,578
How do you feel about it?

145
00:13:49,787 --> 00:13:51,448
Personally.

146
00:13:52,089 --> 00:13:54,523
My job is to represent
the interests of the people...

147
00:13:54,725 --> 00:13:56,386
...and make an effort to be objective.

148
00:13:58,863 --> 00:14:00,660
I ask because I know
you're a churchgoer.

149
00:14:00,865 --> 00:14:02,628
Now you're set to prosecute
a man of God.

150
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:05,134
Your priest broke the law...

151
00:14:05,336 --> 00:14:07,361
...and a young girl is dead.

152
00:14:08,305 --> 00:14:11,502
If he's a man of God, then, personally,
I think he's even more subject...

153
00:14:11,709 --> 00:14:15,304
...to the laws of moral behavior.
If it were up to me, he'd get no deal.

154
00:14:15,513 --> 00:14:19,244
And forgiveness and compassion?
Isn't that part of your creed?

155
00:14:19,450 --> 00:14:21,418
Or does that just get in the way
of your work?

156
00:14:24,822 --> 00:14:26,983
If you have compassion
for your client...

157
00:14:27,191 --> 00:14:29,489
...you'll persuade him to accept this:

158
00:14:29,693 --> 00:14:31,991
Charges reduced
to reckless endangerment.

159
00:14:32,196 --> 00:14:34,289
Twelve months in a county jail.

160
00:14:34,498 --> 00:14:36,898
Reducible to six, plus probation,
if he stays out of trouble.

161
00:14:37,101 --> 00:14:38,762
Somehow I expect
he can manage that.

162
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:42,969
But please understand me.
If he refuses, I will seek the maximum.

163
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:46,204
Father Moore has made it clear
there will be no plea agreement.

164
00:14:46,410 --> 00:14:49,174
He will not lie or admit to something
he is not guilty of.

165
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:52,872
- And he was never neglectful of Emily.
- "Never neglectful"?

166
00:14:53,083 --> 00:14:54,846
Have you seen
the postmortem photographs?

167
00:14:59,323 --> 00:15:03,020
We'll go to trial. My client wants
the public to know the truth.

168
00:15:03,861 --> 00:15:05,488
Good.

169
00:15:06,597 --> 00:15:08,428
So do I.

170
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:12,159
Have a good night, counselor.

171
00:16:21,572 --> 00:16:25,201
Let the record show that the defendant
and his counsel are present...

172
00:16:25,409 --> 00:16:27,070
...and that the jury is seated.

173
00:16:27,678 --> 00:16:31,409
- Mr. Thomas, you may begin.
- Thank you, Your Honor.

174
00:16:31,615 --> 00:16:34,675
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.
My name is Ethan Thomas.

175
00:16:34,885 --> 00:16:38,286
I'm the assistant district attorney,
and I represent the people.

176
00:16:38,489 --> 00:16:40,889
In the case before you,
the evidence will show...

177
00:16:41,091 --> 00:16:45,755
...that the victim had a serious medical
condition that demanded treatment.

178
00:16:45,963 --> 00:16:50,161
We will prove that the victim's
condition rendered her physically...

179
00:16:50,367 --> 00:16:55,327
...and psychologically incapable
of caring for herself.

180
00:16:55,539 --> 00:16:57,029
Her care...

181
00:16:57,241 --> 00:16:58,936
...was then wholly entrusted...

182
00:16:59,476 --> 00:17:03,310
...to that man, the defendant,
Father Richard Moore.

183
00:17:03,514 --> 00:17:06,108
She became his responsibility...

184
00:17:07,117 --> 00:17:09,950
...and he betrayed
that responsibility...

185
00:17:10,154 --> 00:17:12,645
...by persuading her to abandon
her medical treatment...

186
00:17:12,856 --> 00:17:15,347
...in favor of religious treatment:

187
00:17:16,093 --> 00:17:19,688
A ritual exorcism,
performed by the defendant...

188
00:17:19,897 --> 00:17:24,834
...allegedly to cure the victim
by ridding her of demonic forces.

189
00:17:25,502 --> 00:17:29,131
We will demonstrate
that this course of action...

190
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:32,275
...directly resulted
in the victim's death.

191
00:17:33,210 --> 00:17:35,405
I said a moment ago
that I represent the people.

192
00:17:35,612 --> 00:17:38,638
We all know what that means,
but it's a little abstract, isn't it?

193
00:17:39,183 --> 00:17:41,344
Miss Bruner,
the attorney for the defense...

194
00:17:41,552 --> 00:17:44,385
...is seated right next
to the man she represents.

195
00:17:44,588 --> 00:17:47,887
And I stand here
to represent the people.

196
00:17:49,393 --> 00:17:51,327
That's not really why
I stand here today.

197
00:17:52,563 --> 00:17:56,021
I'm here on behalf of someone
who can't sit at a table...

198
00:17:57,234 --> 00:18:00,465
...and look at you every day
and gain your sympathy...

199
00:18:01,138 --> 00:18:03,868
...someone who can't take the stand
to testify...

200
00:18:04,074 --> 00:18:07,407
...and tell you what happened
in her own words.

201
00:18:09,747 --> 00:18:11,214
A young girl...

202
00:18:11,415 --> 00:18:13,349
...that could've been your daughter.

203
00:18:14,184 --> 00:18:15,845
Could've been mine.

204
00:18:16,053 --> 00:18:19,955
A girl who trusted
Father Richard Moore with her life.

205
00:18:26,897 --> 00:18:28,228
This is what she looked like...

206
00:18:31,502 --> 00:18:35,802
...before the defendant began
his religious treatment.

207
00:18:38,375 --> 00:18:42,141
This is a photograph taken of her
on the day that she died.

208
00:18:56,193 --> 00:19:00,527
I stand here for Emily Rose...

209
00:19:02,299 --> 00:19:04,597
...who died horribly...

210
00:19:05,636 --> 00:19:07,831
...at age 19.

211
00:19:09,807 --> 00:19:13,436
You won't be able to see Emily sitting
here day after day during this trial.

212
00:19:13,944 --> 00:19:16,708
But I hope you'll remember her
as she was when she was alive...

213
00:19:18,582 --> 00:19:20,072
...and full of...

214
00:19:21,518 --> 00:19:24,282
...hopes and dreams.

215
00:19:26,256 --> 00:19:30,158
And as she was when Father
Richard Moore was finished with her...

216
00:19:31,428 --> 00:19:32,918
...and left her to die.

217
00:19:36,233 --> 00:19:37,928
Thank you.

218
00:19:38,902 --> 00:19:42,133
Is the defense prepared
to make its opening statement?

219
00:19:45,109 --> 00:19:47,168
I'd like to reserve
my opening statement...

220
00:19:47,377 --> 00:19:49,607
...until the presentation
of the defense's case.

221
00:19:49,813 --> 00:19:51,576
As is your privilege.

222
00:19:52,182 --> 00:19:54,446
Prosecution may begin.

223
00:19:54,651 --> 00:19:56,118
That was already my plan.

224
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:58,811
Thank you, Your Honor.
The people call Dr. Edith Vogel.

225
00:19:59,022 --> 00:20:03,755
I've known Emily her entire life.
I took care of all of the Rose girls.

226
00:20:03,961 --> 00:20:06,987
Can you describe Emily
as you knew her growing up?

227
00:20:07,197 --> 00:20:09,529
She was a bit sickly
in her early years.

228
00:20:09,733 --> 00:20:14,329
She stayed inside a lot,
reading, learning music.

229
00:20:14,872 --> 00:20:16,533
How did she feel about
going to school?

230
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:18,708
Objection.
The witness is not a psychiatrist.

231
00:20:18,909 --> 00:20:22,037
I'll rephrase. Did you talk to Emily
about going off to college?

232
00:20:22,246 --> 00:20:24,737
Yes. She told me she was excited...

233
00:20:24,948 --> 00:20:29,408
...but nervous that she would be away
from her family in the big city.

234
00:20:29,620 --> 00:20:31,611
This was an overwhelming change
for her.

235
00:20:31,822 --> 00:20:33,653
Did you stay in touch
after she went away?

236
00:20:33,857 --> 00:20:39,261
Yes. She wrote me a letter
saying that she'd been to a dance...

237
00:20:39,463 --> 00:20:41,488
...and she'd met a boy
named Jason.

238
00:20:41,899 --> 00:20:43,764
She didn't want her mother
to know this...

239
00:20:43,967 --> 00:20:46,458
...because her mother did not
approve of dancing...

240
00:20:46,670 --> 00:20:48,729
...and had warned her
about the boys at school.

241
00:20:48,939 --> 00:20:52,670
Did Emily communicate with you again
last fall after you received the letter?

242
00:20:52,876 --> 00:20:54,468
Actually, it was her mother.

243
00:20:57,014 --> 00:20:58,572
She telephoned me...

244
00:20:58,782 --> 00:21:01,376
...waking me out of a deep sleep
at 4 in the morning.

245
00:21:02,853 --> 00:21:07,187
<i>She asked me to call Emily at</i>
<i>a payphone on the university campus.</i>

246
00:21:10,127 --> 00:21:13,290
<i>When Emily answered,</i>
<i>she was quite hysterical.</i>

247
00:21:15,098 --> 00:21:17,896
<i>At first, she just</i>
<i>sobbed uncontrollably.</i>

248
00:21:18,635 --> 00:21:22,127
<i>But eventually she calmed down</i>
<i>enough to tell me what happened.</i>

249
00:21:24,074 --> 00:21:26,599
<i>She said that she was alone</i>
<i>that weekend.</i>

250
00:21:26,810 --> 00:21:29,335
<i>Her roommate had gone home.</i>

251
00:21:33,417 --> 00:21:35,408
<i>She had awakened...</i>

252
00:21:36,386 --> 00:21:39,355
<i>... and thought she smelled</i>
<i>something burning.</i>

253
00:21:40,390 --> 00:21:42,984
<i>There was no alarm,</i>
<i>but she got up...</i>

254
00:21:43,794 --> 00:21:45,955
<i>... afraid there was a fire.</i>

255
00:24:50,414 --> 00:24:53,110
<i>Dr. Mueller, what's your position</i>
<i>at the university hospital?</i>

256
00:24:53,316 --> 00:24:55,944
I am chairman of
the Department of Neurology.

257
00:24:56,153 --> 00:24:58,417
And after you heard
about the dorm-room incident...

258
00:24:58,622 --> 00:25:00,180
...what were your initial thoughts?

259
00:25:00,390 --> 00:25:03,484
At first, I thought perhaps
Emily had taken illegal drugs.

260
00:25:03,693 --> 00:25:05,490
Some type of hallucinogen.

261
00:25:05,695 --> 00:25:09,529
But we ran tests and found no trace
of drugs in her system.

262
00:25:09,733 --> 00:25:11,963
And the more she explained
the incident to me...

263
00:25:12,169 --> 00:25:15,366
...the more I began to suspect
something else.

264
00:25:15,572 --> 00:25:20,032
Epilepsy results from uncontrolled
electrical activity in the brain.

265
00:25:20,977 --> 00:25:22,945
<i>In a severe, or grand mal, seizure...</i>

266
00:25:23,146 --> 00:25:25,637
<i>... a person may lose consciousness</i>
<i>for several minutes...</i>

267
00:25:25,849 --> 00:25:29,182
<i>... and suffer involuntary contractions</i>
<i>of all the muscles of the body.</i>

268
00:25:29,386 --> 00:25:31,786
<i>Is it possible for a person</i>
<i>suffering such a seizure...</i>

269
00:25:31,988 --> 00:25:35,287
<i>... to have hallucinations or perceive</i>
<i>the things that Emily described?</i>

270
00:25:35,492 --> 00:25:38,984
<i>The muscle contractions could feel</i>
<i>like an extreme pressure on the body.</i>

271
00:25:39,196 --> 00:25:42,029
<i>And it is certainly possible,</i>
<i>with all that brain activity...</i>

272
00:25:42,232 --> 00:25:46,464
...for a person to perceive all sorts
of strange and violent things.

273
00:25:46,937 --> 00:25:50,202
So suspecting that Emily was
epileptic, how did you proceed?

274
00:25:50,407 --> 00:25:52,602
I administered
an electroencephalograph.

275
00:25:52,809 --> 00:25:54,003
What did the EEG reveal?

276
00:25:54,211 --> 00:25:58,648
It showed a possible epileptic focus
in the patient's left temporal lobe.

277
00:25:58,849 --> 00:26:00,612
Did this require
a specific treatment?

278
00:26:00,817 --> 00:26:03,945
Yes, I began a medication schedule
for Emily with the drug Gambutrol.

279
00:26:04,154 --> 00:26:08,181
I also advised regular follow-up
examinations and further tests.

280
00:26:08,391 --> 00:26:11,360
But Emily failed to keep
her follow-up appointments with me.

281
00:26:12,028 --> 00:26:14,622
She give any reason for discontinuing
these appointments?

282
00:26:14,831 --> 00:26:18,494
Yes, she told me she was convinced
that her condition was a spiritual one.

283
00:26:18,702 --> 00:26:22,968
It was the conviction of her priest,
she said, and she shared his beliefs.

284
00:26:23,173 --> 00:26:25,733
Was it your impression
that Emily had placed her care...

285
00:26:25,942 --> 00:26:27,807
...entirely...?
- Leading the witness.

286
00:26:28,211 --> 00:26:29,439
Sustained.

287
00:26:32,115 --> 00:26:33,605
After the end of October...

288
00:26:33,817 --> 00:26:36,115
...did you ask Emily
why she had stopped...

289
00:26:36,319 --> 00:26:37,980
...filling her Gambutrol
prescriptions?

290
00:26:38,188 --> 00:26:42,591
Yes. She said that Father Moore had
suggested she stop taking the drug.

291
00:26:42,792 --> 00:26:44,419
And what, in your medical opinion...

292
00:26:44,628 --> 00:26:46,823
...was the result
of Father Moore's suggestion?

293
00:26:47,030 --> 00:26:49,157
I believe Father Moore's suggestion
killed her.

294
00:26:49,366 --> 00:26:50,731
Objection, Your Honor!

295
00:26:50,934 --> 00:26:54,233
The witness is asserting outrageous
conclusions based on pure hearsay.

296
00:26:54,971 --> 00:26:59,567
Technically correct, but I'll allow it
as part of his expert opinion testimony.

297
00:26:59,776 --> 00:27:01,505
Thank you, Dr. Mueller.

298
00:27:01,711 --> 00:27:02,905
Your witness.

299
00:27:03,113 --> 00:27:08,107
You said you observed a possible
epileptic focus in the temporal lobe.

300
00:27:08,318 --> 00:27:11,913
Doesn't this imply what you observed
may not have been an epileptic focus?

301
00:27:12,122 --> 00:27:13,714
Yes, that's also possible.

302
00:27:13,924 --> 00:27:17,052
Would Father Moore's advice to stop
taking Gambutrol be good advice...

303
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:19,160
...if Emily were, in fact,
not epileptic?

304
00:27:19,396 --> 00:27:22,524
Of course. But that's not
the case here. She was epileptic.

305
00:27:22,966 --> 00:27:24,228
Really.

306
00:27:24,935 --> 00:27:28,029
When Emily saw objects move
on their own...

307
00:27:28,238 --> 00:27:31,036
...and felt an invisible presence
on top of her...

308
00:27:31,241 --> 00:27:33,732
...was she experiencing symptoms
typical of epilepsy?

309
00:27:33,944 --> 00:27:35,138
Not typical, no.

310
00:27:35,345 --> 00:27:37,973
Are they typical indications
of any other conditions?

311
00:27:38,181 --> 00:27:41,241
- Say, for example, psychosis?
- Yes, I would say that's correct.

312
00:27:42,285 --> 00:27:45,948
But isn't psychosis an entirely different
medical condition from epilepsy?

313
00:27:47,057 --> 00:27:49,321
- Yes, in my...
- So aren't you selectively choosing...

314
00:27:49,526 --> 00:27:52,495
...what parts of Emily's experiences
fit your epilepsy diagnosis...

315
00:27:52,696 --> 00:27:54,926
...while ignoring those which
indicate something else?

316
00:27:55,131 --> 00:27:57,497
- Objection. Argumentative.
- Withdrawn.

317
00:27:58,802 --> 00:28:00,269
No further questions.

318
00:28:33,036 --> 00:28:35,095
We have to work fast.

319
00:28:35,305 --> 00:28:37,637
They're only giving me an hour
with you tonight.

320
00:28:38,742 --> 00:28:40,437
Listen.

321
00:28:40,877 --> 00:28:43,710
Before we get started,
there's something I have to tell you...

322
00:28:43,913 --> 00:28:47,007
...something I should've said to you
before I let you take the case.

323
00:28:47,217 --> 00:28:48,548
Okay.

324
00:28:51,454 --> 00:28:54,821
There are forces
surrounding this trial.

325
00:28:55,592 --> 00:28:58,686
Dark, powerful forces.

326
00:28:59,763 --> 00:29:03,392
Just be careful, Erin.
Watch your step.

327
00:29:04,801 --> 00:29:06,462
I see.

328
00:29:08,605 --> 00:29:10,072
Look...

329
00:29:11,074 --> 00:29:13,508
Father, you don't have to worry
about me.

330
00:29:13,710 --> 00:29:15,143
I'm an agnostic, remember?

331
00:29:15,679 --> 00:29:17,909
Demons exist,
whether you believe in them or not.

332
00:29:18,248 --> 00:29:22,480
Your involvement in this trial might
just open you up to their attacks.

333
00:29:23,586 --> 00:29:26,612
Look, Father,
I appreciate your concern...

334
00:29:26,823 --> 00:29:29,053
...but you need to be worried
about yourself.

335
00:29:29,259 --> 00:29:32,558
Ethan Thomas is using the medical
aspects of this case as ammunition...

336
00:29:32,762 --> 00:29:36,562
...and I have to be prepared
for his attacks, so...

337
00:29:36,766 --> 00:29:42,500
...with what little time we have, I think
we need to focus on your defense.

338
00:29:54,150 --> 00:29:58,280
Now, what I need from you is more
information about Emily's condition.

339
00:29:58,488 --> 00:30:02,481
Specific details of how it progressed
after the dorm-room episode.

340
00:30:02,692 --> 00:30:04,751
Well, after the first incident...

341
00:30:04,961 --> 00:30:10,866
...she was sent to the university
hospital for testing and observation.

342
00:30:46,836 --> 00:30:50,772
Emily once told me that in her
dorm room, she resisted the demons...

343
00:30:50,974 --> 00:30:53,772
...but at the hospital
they overcame her.

344
00:30:54,277 --> 00:30:55,608
So she believed...

345
00:30:55,812 --> 00:30:57,939
...that her possession
began at the hospital?

346
00:30:59,015 --> 00:31:02,007
Yeah, I think she did.

347
00:31:02,218 --> 00:31:05,153
And after that, things just went
from bad to worse.

348
00:33:08,244 --> 00:33:10,212
Emily!

349
00:33:49,552 --> 00:33:50,917
Emily?

350
00:34:21,484 --> 00:34:23,475
Oh, my God. Emily?

351
00:34:25,021 --> 00:34:27,546
Don't touch me.

352
00:34:34,197 --> 00:34:37,291
Jason, please...

353
00:34:38,334 --> 00:34:40,734
...don't leave me.

354
00:34:48,111 --> 00:34:50,602
<i>And I never did leave her.</i>

355
00:34:50,813 --> 00:34:52,371
<i>I stayed until the end.</i>

356
00:34:54,384 --> 00:34:58,286
So much of what we shared
was like a nightmare...

357
00:34:58,488 --> 00:35:01,423
...but I wouldn't give up
a single minute I spent with her.

358
00:35:03,593 --> 00:35:06,061
She woke me up, you know?

359
00:35:06,262 --> 00:35:10,756
To things I never felt before,
things I never knew I could feel.

360
00:35:12,835 --> 00:35:16,236
I never knew how dead I was
until I met her.

361
00:35:20,143 --> 00:35:23,579
- <i>residential north metro district</i>
<i>where James Van Hopper...</i>

362
00:35:23,780 --> 00:35:26,044
<i>... acquitted after</i>
<i>a controversial trial...</i>

363
00:35:26,249 --> 00:35:29,013
- Can you turn that up, please?
- <i>... has apparently struck again.</i>

364
00:35:29,218 --> 00:35:31,049
<i>It was inside</i>
<i>this quiet suburban home...</i>

365
00:35:31,254 --> 00:35:34,849
<i>... that police say James Van Hopper</i>
<i>murdered a young couple today.</i>

366
00:35:35,058 --> 00:35:37,754
<i>Sources close to the investigation</i>
<i>say that Van Hopper...</i>

367
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:40,190
<i>... who was acquitted</i>
<i>of murder charges in April...</i>

368
00:35:40,396 --> 00:35:42,330
<i>... may have known</i>
<i>both of the victims.</i>

369
00:35:42,532 --> 00:35:46,491
<i>Their names are being withheld</i>
<i>pending family notification.</i>

370
00:40:35,424 --> 00:40:37,517
Most glorious prince
of the heavenly army...

371
00:40:37,727 --> 00:40:39,661
...holy Michael, the archangel...

372
00:40:39,862 --> 00:40:42,126
...defend us in battle
against the princes...

373
00:40:42,331 --> 00:40:44,731
...powers and rulers of darkness.

374
00:41:05,087 --> 00:41:09,217
Counsel Bruner, my courtroom day
begins at 9:30 a.m.

375
00:41:09,425 --> 00:41:13,361
- I'm sorry, Your Honor, I...
- Which was 17 minutes ago.

376
00:41:15,431 --> 00:41:16,955
Ready to proceed?

377
00:41:18,100 --> 00:41:19,465
Yes, Your Honor.

378
00:41:19,668 --> 00:41:22,228
Dr. Briggs, please state
your qualifications for the court.

379
00:41:22,438 --> 00:41:24,599
I have advanced degrees
in medicine...

380
00:41:24,807 --> 00:41:27,708
...psychiatry and neurology
from Johns Hopkins...

381
00:41:27,910 --> 00:41:32,006
...and I have had three books
and several dozen papers published...

382
00:41:32,214 --> 00:41:35,081
...in the fields of neurology
and neuropsychiatry.

383
00:41:35,284 --> 00:41:38,310
What was the cause of death,
as determined by the autopsy?

384
00:41:38,521 --> 00:41:42,855
The decedent expired due to a gradual
shutdown of the bodily functions.

385
00:41:43,058 --> 00:41:44,923
Why did her body shut down?

386
00:41:45,127 --> 00:41:48,062
The autopsy found
that it was a cumulative effect...

387
00:41:48,264 --> 00:41:51,893
...from numerous physical traumas
exacerbated by malnutrition...

388
00:41:52,101 --> 00:41:56,970
...which severely inhibited her ability
to recuperate from those traumas.

389
00:41:57,173 --> 00:42:01,610
In other words, her starving body
had little or no means to recover...

390
00:42:01,811 --> 00:42:05,747
...from the injuries it was sustaining,
and so it eventually just gave out.

391
00:42:05,948 --> 00:42:07,575
How did Emily get these injuries?

392
00:42:07,783 --> 00:42:10,581
Some were the result
of violent epileptic seizures...

393
00:42:10,786 --> 00:42:12,413
...and some were self-inflicted.

394
00:42:12,621 --> 00:42:15,317
And why, in your opinion,
did Emily injure herself...

395
00:42:15,524 --> 00:42:16,957
...and why did she stop eating?

396
00:42:17,159 --> 00:42:20,322
Upon review
of her complete medical file...

397
00:42:20,529 --> 00:42:23,020
...I concluded that Emily's epilepsy
had evolved...

398
00:42:23,232 --> 00:42:26,690
...into a condition known as
psychotic epileptic disorder.

399
00:42:26,902 --> 00:42:28,665
This is a rare development,
to be sure...

400
00:42:28,871 --> 00:42:31,237
...but one that I have witnessed
numerous times.

401
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:35,206
- Emily was epileptic and psychotic?
- Yes.

402
00:42:35,411 --> 00:42:38,869
Explain how this psychotic epileptic
disorder would manifest itself.

403
00:42:39,081 --> 00:42:41,879
The seizures would have
the symptoms of schizophrenia...

404
00:42:42,084 --> 00:42:45,451
<i>... such as auditory</i>
<i>and visual hallucinations...</i>

405
00:42:46,155 --> 00:42:48,123
<i>... and sometimes extreme paranoia.</i>

406
00:42:48,324 --> 00:42:51,555
<i>The seizures may lock up the joints</i>
<i>and slightly contort the body.</i>

407
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:54,752
<i>The pupils will dilate,</i>
<i>making the eyes appear black.</i>

408
00:42:54,964 --> 00:42:56,761
So you believe
that Emily had epilepsy...

409
00:42:56,966 --> 00:42:59,730
...which developed into
a form of violent psychosis...

410
00:42:59,935 --> 00:43:02,233
...a condition that can be controlled
with Gambutrol?

411
00:43:02,438 --> 00:43:05,874
Yes. And it would've been,
if she'd continued her treatment.

412
00:43:06,075 --> 00:43:08,839
In your opinion, if Emily
had continued with her medication...

413
00:43:09,044 --> 00:43:11,512
...would she be alive today?
- Absolutely.

414
00:43:11,714 --> 00:43:17,084
If treated early, psychotic epileptic
disorder is rarely fatal.

415
00:43:17,286 --> 00:43:18,878
I mean, this...

416
00:43:19,088 --> 00:43:22,421
This was a very sick girl.

417
00:43:22,758 --> 00:43:25,283
The defendant should've realized
that Emily was in need...

418
00:43:25,494 --> 00:43:28,190
...of continued medical treatment.

419
00:43:29,131 --> 00:43:32,032
Thank you, doctor. Your witness.

420
00:43:35,004 --> 00:43:38,997
Doctor, you testified that Gambutrol
could've controlled Emily's condition.

421
00:43:39,742 --> 00:43:40,936
How do you know that?

422
00:43:41,143 --> 00:43:44,704
It's the inevitable result
of taking the drug.

423
00:43:44,914 --> 00:43:46,779
It would've controlled
her seizures...

424
00:43:46,982 --> 00:43:48,973
...which were the root cause
of her psychosis.

425
00:43:49,184 --> 00:43:52,119
But wasn't Emily still experiencing
psychotic symptoms...

426
00:43:52,321 --> 00:43:54,414
...even after she started
taking the medication?

427
00:43:54,623 --> 00:43:57,490
Yes. Because Gambutrol
has a cumulative effect.

428
00:43:57,693 --> 00:43:59,752
It takes time to build up
in the system.

429
00:43:59,962 --> 00:44:03,329
You assume that Gambutrol would've
helped her, but you don't know.

430
00:44:03,532 --> 00:44:05,762
It's a reasonable assumption, but...

431
00:44:06,335 --> 00:44:07,859
No, of course, I can't be certain.

432
00:44:09,471 --> 00:44:14,841
Doctor, is "psychotic epileptic
disorder" a common medical term...

433
00:44:15,044 --> 00:44:16,602
...or did you just make it up?

434
00:44:17,413 --> 00:44:19,881
Well, I distinguished
and named the...

435
00:44:20,082 --> 00:44:23,449
So psychotic epileptic disorder
is really your own pet theory?

436
00:44:23,652 --> 00:44:25,313
- Objection. Argumentative.
- Sustained.

437
00:44:25,521 --> 00:44:29,423
When Emily chose
to stop her medical treatment...

438
00:44:29,625 --> 00:44:31,650
...what do you think
should've been done?

439
00:44:31,860 --> 00:44:33,555
Upon recognizing her condition...

440
00:44:33,762 --> 00:44:36,925
...I would have tranquilized her
and force-fed her.

441
00:44:37,132 --> 00:44:38,429
And then, if necessary...

442
00:44:38,634 --> 00:44:41,125
...I would've treated her
with electroconvulsive therapy.

443
00:44:41,337 --> 00:44:44,238
Electroshock treatment. You would've
done this against her will?

444
00:44:46,108 --> 00:44:47,439
To save her life?

445
00:44:50,512 --> 00:44:52,343
Absolutely.

446
00:45:01,123 --> 00:45:02,590
Nothing further.

447
00:45:05,594 --> 00:45:07,926
The witness may step down.

448
00:45:09,298 --> 00:45:12,995
Your Honor, I offer into evidence this
photograph as People's Exhibit 3-A.

449
00:45:13,202 --> 00:45:14,829
And having done so,
the people rest.

450
00:45:15,037 --> 00:45:16,971
The photograph is entered
into evidence.

451
00:45:17,172 --> 00:45:22,109
We are recessed until
tomorrow morning, 9:30 sharp...

452
00:45:22,311 --> 00:45:25,178
...at which time the defense
will give its opening statement...

453
00:45:25,381 --> 00:45:27,042
...and call its first witness.

454
00:45:28,484 --> 00:45:30,384
I'm sorry I was late.

455
00:45:30,586 --> 00:45:34,044
I didn't get a lot of sleep. Big power
outage knocked out my alarm clock.

456
00:45:34,256 --> 00:45:36,520
- It won't happen again.
- No, I didn't sleep either.

457
00:45:37,226 --> 00:45:38,557
What kept you awake?

458
00:45:39,662 --> 00:45:41,095
Doesn't matter.

459
00:45:43,198 --> 00:45:44,825
You're under attack.

460
00:45:46,468 --> 00:45:47,992
What are you talking about?

461
00:45:48,937 --> 00:45:51,303
You're in a spiritual battle, Erin.

462
00:45:51,507 --> 00:45:54,670
The forces of darkness are trying
to keep you away from the light.

463
00:45:56,311 --> 00:45:57,778
Don't let them.

464
00:45:59,148 --> 00:46:02,140
Don't worry about today.
We're doing fine.

465
00:46:03,385 --> 00:46:06,411
We're getting creamed.
I can't believe I walked right into that.

466
00:46:06,622 --> 00:46:09,785
Look, if we don't find a doctor
to testify that Emily...

467
00:46:09,992 --> 00:46:15,225
...wasn't epileptic or schizophrenic
or schizo-epileptic, we're gonna lose.

468
00:46:23,572 --> 00:46:26,564
Care of the city's main branch
and the university library...

469
00:46:26,775 --> 00:46:28,970
...I bring you another dozen
fun-filled books...

470
00:46:29,178 --> 00:46:32,545
...about the demonic
and the mentally deranged.

471
00:46:33,916 --> 00:46:35,440
They burned women at the stake...

472
00:46:35,651 --> 00:46:37,710
...during witch hunts
for being possessed.

473
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:39,717
Glad you don't have to defend
those guys.

474
00:46:39,922 --> 00:46:42,322
- How are we on our medical experts?
- Not good.

475
00:46:42,524 --> 00:46:45,721
The psychiatrist you wanted
is tied up in another trial.

476
00:46:45,928 --> 00:46:49,830
And the neurologist is sailing
to Costa Rica.

477
00:46:50,099 --> 00:46:52,260
This book I'm reading,
it's by an anthropologist.

478
00:46:53,335 --> 00:46:56,600
It's about contemporary cases of
possession, mostly in the Third World.

479
00:46:56,805 --> 00:46:59,069
People there are still
primitive and superstitious.

480
00:46:59,274 --> 00:47:00,639
Maybe.

481
00:47:00,843 --> 00:47:03,471
Maybe they see possession
for what it really is.

482
00:47:03,679 --> 00:47:05,544
Maybe we've taught ourselves
not to see it.

483
00:47:07,116 --> 00:47:09,710
- You saying you believe in this stuff?
- No.

484
00:47:09,918 --> 00:47:13,217
Maybe we shouldn't just try
to invalidate the prosecution's case...

485
00:47:13,422 --> 00:47:15,982
...by punching holes
in the medical approach.

486
00:47:16,191 --> 00:47:20,628
Maybe we should also try
to validate the alternative.

487
00:47:24,233 --> 00:47:28,169
- Validate possession in a court of law?
- Yes.

488
00:47:30,305 --> 00:47:34,264
Okay. I guess we could bring in
some priests to talk about exorcisms...

489
00:47:34,476 --> 00:47:36,706
No, the archdiocese
won't let us do that.

490
00:47:36,912 --> 00:47:40,245
They wanna limit the Church's
exposure to Father Moore.

491
00:47:40,449 --> 00:47:43,350
I've got three articles by the
anthropologist who wrote this book.

492
00:47:43,552 --> 00:47:45,520
She approaches
the subject of possession...

493
00:47:45,721 --> 00:47:49,122
...from a scientific perspective
and doesn't try to debunk it.

494
00:47:49,324 --> 00:47:52,122
- You want me to track her down?
- Yeah.

495
00:47:53,395 --> 00:47:56,523
Keep looking for a medical expert
to refute Dr. Briggs.

496
00:47:56,732 --> 00:47:59,462
But send the case file
to this Dr. Sadira Adani.

497
00:48:01,236 --> 00:48:03,397
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury...

498
00:48:03,605 --> 00:48:06,165
...as you know by now,
my name is Erin Bruner...

499
00:48:06,375 --> 00:48:08,502
...and I represent the defendant,
Richard Moore.

500
00:48:09,978 --> 00:48:12,811
Mr. Thomas has contended
that Emily Rose suffered...

501
00:48:13,015 --> 00:48:14,949
...from a serious medical condition...

502
00:48:15,150 --> 00:48:18,551
...that required medical treatment,
nothing more.

503
00:48:18,754 --> 00:48:21,416
He has asserted that any attempt
by my client...

504
00:48:21,623 --> 00:48:24,683
...to help Emily by anything
other than medical means...

505
00:48:24,893 --> 00:48:28,727
...was not only inappropriate,
but criminally negligent.

506
00:48:30,232 --> 00:48:32,962
I'm now gonna ask
that you keep an open mind...

507
00:48:33,168 --> 00:48:36,433
...to what our evidence
and testimony will show.

508
00:48:36,638 --> 00:48:39,573
Medical treatment was not
the answer for Emily...

509
00:48:39,775 --> 00:48:43,404
...because she simply did not suffer
from a medical condition.

510
00:48:43,612 --> 00:48:48,106
She was neither epileptic
nor psychotic.

511
00:48:50,953 --> 00:48:54,548
Emily Rose's condition, in fact,
was demonic possession.

512
00:48:54,756 --> 00:48:58,248
An exorcism was her only hope
for a cure.

513
00:48:58,460 --> 00:49:02,419
Some of you may find yourself unable
to reconcile Emily's beliefs...

514
00:49:02,631 --> 00:49:04,929
...or those of the defendant
with your own.

515
00:49:05,133 --> 00:49:09,263
You may not believe demons exist.
You won't have to.

516
00:49:09,738 --> 00:49:13,265
Because you will see that after the
utter failure of doctors to help Emily...

517
00:49:14,042 --> 00:49:17,478
...Father Moore simply tried
to help Emily in a different way...

518
00:49:17,679 --> 00:49:23,208
...using an approach that he,
Emily and her family firmly believed...

519
00:49:23,418 --> 00:49:25,579
...was her only chance for relief.

520
00:49:25,787 --> 00:49:28,415
And we will show that
despite his greatest efforts...

521
00:49:28,624 --> 00:49:30,751
...and his sincere love for Emily...

522
00:49:32,294 --> 00:49:37,129
<i>... there was nothing he could've done</i>
<i>to prevent the death of Emily Rose.</i>

523
00:49:40,469 --> 00:49:42,300
Are you okay?

524
00:49:43,639 --> 00:49:45,129
Aren't you gonna eat anything?

525
00:50:18,607 --> 00:50:22,907
<i>She said it was terrible to hear</i>
<i>the clinking of spoons and forks.</i>

526
00:50:23,412 --> 00:50:26,245
She was always hungry,
but she said they wouldn't let her eat.

527
00:50:27,516 --> 00:50:29,643
Who did she mean by "they"?

528
00:50:30,619 --> 00:50:33,520
The forces that were
in control of her.

529
00:50:33,722 --> 00:50:36,020
That were inside her.

530
00:50:37,592 --> 00:50:39,082
You know, the demons.

531
00:50:41,196 --> 00:50:43,357
Tell us what else happened
that night.

532
00:50:47,402 --> 00:50:49,870
I walked her back to her dorm...

533
00:50:50,505 --> 00:50:53,269
...and she seemed really nervous
and scared.

534
00:50:53,475 --> 00:50:57,275
<i>So I held her for a while,</i>
<i>trying to calm her down.</i>

535
00:50:57,479 --> 00:51:02,940
<i>I fell asleep, but when I woke up,</i>
<i>she wasn't beside me.</i>

536
00:51:15,998 --> 00:51:17,556
Emily?

537
00:51:29,778 --> 00:51:31,268
Hey.

538
00:51:35,384 --> 00:51:37,318
Can you hear me?

539
00:51:49,331 --> 00:51:51,925
<i>I called her father, and he told me</i>
<i>to bring Emily home.</i>

540
00:51:54,536 --> 00:51:56,800
<i>Jason and I put Emily to bed...</i>

541
00:51:57,005 --> 00:51:59,166
<i>... hoping she would sleep.</i>

542
00:51:59,374 --> 00:52:01,342
And when did Father Moore
become involved?

543
00:52:03,178 --> 00:52:05,203
Emily stayed home after that.

544
00:52:05,414 --> 00:52:09,510
She didn't return to school,
and she kept getting worse.

545
00:52:09,718 --> 00:52:14,348
Eventually, when she didn't get better,
we called our priest, Father Moore.

546
00:52:15,190 --> 00:52:17,750
When he arrived,
I sent my daughter Alice upstairs...

547
00:52:17,959 --> 00:52:20,325
<i>... to see if Emily was awake.</i>

548
00:52:29,838 --> 00:52:31,135
Emily?

549
00:52:34,376 --> 00:52:36,310
Can I come in?

550
00:52:50,459 --> 00:52:53,587
- Our Father, who art in heaven...
- Emily?

551
00:52:57,966 --> 00:53:00,628
Father Moore is here.
Can you come downstairs?

552
00:53:00,836 --> 00:53:03,031
- As it is in heaven.

553
00:53:03,238 --> 00:53:06,605
Give us this day our daily bread...

554
00:53:55,357 --> 00:53:56,619
Emily, can you hear me?

555
00:54:12,741 --> 00:54:14,106
Let's get her off the floor.

556
00:54:15,477 --> 00:54:16,569
Alice, no!

557
00:55:52,507 --> 00:55:55,670
You've suffered a terrible loss,
Mr. Rose. I know this is difficult.

558
00:55:55,877 --> 00:55:58,243
So thank you for being here today.

559
00:55:58,446 --> 00:55:59,936
Sir, do you often read the Bible?

560
00:56:00,148 --> 00:56:01,911
- Yes, I do.
- So do I.

561
00:56:03,385 --> 00:56:04,682
What about the <i>DSM</i>?

562
00:56:04,886 --> 00:56:07,753
The <i>Diagnostic and Statistical</i>
<i>Manual of Mental Disorders</i>...

563
00:56:07,956 --> 00:56:11,016
...commonly referred to
as the bible of abnormal psychiatry.

564
00:56:11,226 --> 00:56:12,716
- Have you read that?
- No.

565
00:56:12,927 --> 00:56:15,157
So you're not aware
that according to the <i>DSM</i>...

566
00:56:15,363 --> 00:56:19,527
...a person's refusal to eat is
a common indication of anorexia?

567
00:56:19,734 --> 00:56:23,170
Objection. The witness just said
he hasn't read the <i>DSM</i>, Your Honor.

568
00:56:23,371 --> 00:56:25,669
- Sustained.
- Mr. Rose...

569
00:56:26,241 --> 00:56:28,436
...are you aware
that catatonic rigidity...

570
00:56:28,643 --> 00:56:31,009
...specifically a locking up
of the body's joints...

571
00:56:31,212 --> 00:56:32,873
...is a known symptom of psychosis?

572
00:56:33,081 --> 00:56:35,379
No. I haven't studied these things.

573
00:56:35,583 --> 00:56:37,710
Have you ever visited
an insane asylum...

574
00:56:38,086 --> 00:56:40,179
...or a hospital for the mentally ill?

575
00:56:40,922 --> 00:56:43,720
Once. My aunt was in one
before she died.

576
00:56:43,925 --> 00:56:47,019
Really? So there's a history
of mental illness in your family?

577
00:56:47,562 --> 00:56:49,052
I suppose.

578
00:56:49,264 --> 00:56:52,131
Sir, if you saw someone
eating insects...

579
00:56:52,600 --> 00:56:56,832
...on a street corner, would you say
that that person is mentally ill?

580
00:56:57,038 --> 00:56:59,529
- Probably, yes.
- So can you say with confidence...

581
00:56:59,741 --> 00:57:02,301
...that the behavior you saw
in your daughter's bedroom...

582
00:57:02,510 --> 00:57:05,411
...could not be the behavior of
someone suffering from psychosis?

583
00:57:05,613 --> 00:57:09,413
I don't know. She never had
any problems like that before.

584
00:57:10,051 --> 00:57:13,919
It just didn't feel that way to me
or to Father Moore.

585
00:57:15,323 --> 00:57:17,154
- And you trusted him, right?
- Yes.

586
00:57:17,359 --> 00:57:19,020
He is our parish priest.

587
00:57:19,227 --> 00:57:22,424
Fair enough. And after that night,
would you say that you...

588
00:57:22,630 --> 00:57:25,155
...put your daughter entirely
in Father Moore's care?

589
00:57:25,367 --> 00:57:27,892
Yes. We had done all we could.

590
00:57:28,103 --> 00:57:30,401
We said she was in his hands now...

591
00:57:30,905 --> 00:57:32,770
...body and soul.

592
00:57:33,908 --> 00:57:36,877
Thank you. No further questions,
Your Honor.

593
00:57:37,078 --> 00:57:39,046
Thank you, Mr. Rose.
You may step down.

594
00:57:41,316 --> 00:57:44,080
The defense calls Dr. Sadira Adani.

595
00:57:44,285 --> 00:57:48,449
I am currently a professor
of anthropology and psychiatry...

596
00:57:48,656 --> 00:57:50,749
...at Northwestern University.

597
00:57:50,959 --> 00:57:52,620
Where did you receive
your education?

598
00:57:52,827 --> 00:57:55,022
At Yale, and then at Cambridge.

599
00:57:55,230 --> 00:57:57,630
And what is your specific area
of expertise?

600
00:57:57,832 --> 00:58:02,132
I study the spiritual experiences
of people in various cultures...

601
00:58:02,337 --> 00:58:05,636
...and the physiological
and psychological changes...

602
00:58:05,840 --> 00:58:09,207
...they undergo
during these experiences.

603
00:58:09,411 --> 00:58:13,404
Would it be accurate to say that you
specialize in the study of possession?

604
00:58:13,615 --> 00:58:18,609
Yes. "Possession" is one term
for a basic human experience...

605
00:58:18,820 --> 00:58:23,621
...reported by a great number
of people all around the world.

606
00:58:23,825 --> 00:58:27,852
In my fieldwork, I've seen
many people who experienced...

607
00:58:28,062 --> 00:58:32,795
...a sense of being invaded by
an entity from the supernatural realm.

608
00:58:33,001 --> 00:58:34,935
Why do you think
Emily was invaded?

609
00:58:35,136 --> 00:58:37,400
Why did this possession
happen to her?

610
00:58:37,605 --> 00:58:40,039
Based on my study of the case file...

611
00:58:40,241 --> 00:58:44,302
...I believe that Emily Rose
was a hypersensitive.

612
00:58:44,512 --> 00:58:46,980
A person with
an unusual connection...

613
00:58:47,182 --> 00:58:50,982
...to what Carlos Castaneda called
"the separate reality."

614
00:58:51,553 --> 00:58:56,149
Hypersensitives are born
different from everyone else.

615
00:58:56,357 --> 00:59:00,191
They can have visions of the future,
or see the dead...

616
00:59:00,395 --> 00:59:03,626
...and sometimes be
uniquely susceptible...

617
00:59:03,832 --> 00:59:06,824
...to invasion by an entity
that is alien to them.

618
00:59:07,035 --> 00:59:08,161
Objection.

619
00:59:10,104 --> 00:59:11,571
On what grounds?

620
00:59:11,773 --> 00:59:13,604
How about silliness, Your Honor?

621
00:59:13,808 --> 00:59:15,503
A young girl
suffered terribly and died.

622
00:59:15,710 --> 00:59:19,202
Do we have to subject her illness
to this pseudoscientific analysis?

623
00:59:19,414 --> 00:59:22,315
Both counselors,
please approach the bench.

624
00:59:22,717 --> 00:59:25,277
Your Honor, this testimony
is beyond ridiculous. Visions...

625
00:59:25,487 --> 00:59:28,650
Supernatural belief systems
are shared by millions of people.

626
00:59:28,857 --> 00:59:30,256
We're in <i>The Twilight Zone</i> here.

627
00:59:30,458 --> 00:59:32,824
Her expertise is relevant
to the issues in this case.

628
00:59:33,027 --> 00:59:35,120
Let's have a witch doctor
sift through bones...

629
00:59:35,330 --> 00:59:36,763
Stop.

630
00:59:40,235 --> 00:59:42,032
We've heard a great deal
of testimony...

631
00:59:42,237 --> 00:59:46,298
...in support of a medical explanation
for Emily's condition.

632
00:59:46,508 --> 00:59:48,601
Now we have a witness
who has spent her career...

633
00:59:48,810 --> 00:59:52,041
...studying the defense's
alternative explanation.

634
00:59:52,247 --> 00:59:54,238
An exorcism expert, if you will.

635
00:59:55,583 --> 00:59:57,847
I think we'll hear
what she has to say.

636
00:59:58,052 --> 00:59:59,314
Thank you, Your Honor.

637
01:00:01,689 --> 01:00:06,183
Dr. Adani, why do you think
Emily's exorcism failed?

638
01:00:06,661 --> 01:00:11,598
The medical treatment.
Specifically, the drug Gambutrol.

639
01:00:11,799 --> 01:00:13,232
Please explain.

640
01:00:13,434 --> 01:00:17,837
The exorcism ritual results
in a specific brain activity...

641
01:00:18,039 --> 01:00:21,770
...that cuts the person off from
the possession experience.

642
01:00:22,510 --> 01:00:26,776
But Emily's exorcism
could not have achieved this...

643
01:00:26,981 --> 01:00:29,677
...because the doctor
gave her Gambutrol...

644
01:00:29,884 --> 01:00:33,752
...which has an intoxicating effect
on the brain.

645
01:00:33,955 --> 01:00:37,891
The drug made her immune
to the psycho-spiritual shock...

646
01:00:38,092 --> 01:00:41,027
...that exorcism
is intended to provide.

647
01:00:41,229 --> 01:00:45,188
What do you believe was the result of
treatment with this intoxicating drug?

648
01:00:45,400 --> 01:00:49,097
Gambutrol locked Emily
in the possessed state.

649
01:00:49,304 --> 01:00:52,671
This left her unable to respond
to the exorcism...

650
01:00:52,874 --> 01:00:57,106
...and therefore, it directly
contributed to her death.

651
01:00:58,713 --> 01:01:00,578
Thank you, doctor.

652
01:01:01,783 --> 01:01:03,478
No further questions.

653
01:01:09,490 --> 01:01:12,323
I'm looking at a list of
your published articles, doctor.

654
01:01:12,627 --> 01:01:14,652
You've been quite busy and prolific.

655
01:01:14,963 --> 01:01:18,490
So based on your time spent
with Holy Roller snake-handlers...

656
01:01:18,700 --> 01:01:22,761
...voodoo priestesses
and Indians tripping on peyote buds...

657
01:01:23,037 --> 01:01:26,803
...based on observing
these bizarre individuals...

658
01:01:27,008 --> 01:01:28,999
...you've concluded
that possession is...

659
01:01:29,210 --> 01:01:30,768
...a basic, typical
human experience?

660
01:01:30,979 --> 01:01:32,537
I must say, counselor...

661
01:01:32,747 --> 01:01:35,307
...that's quite a laundry list
of disdain...

662
01:01:35,516 --> 01:01:39,008
...and one that thoroughly
mischaracterizes my research.

663
01:01:39,387 --> 01:01:43,949
No, I don't think possession
is a typical experience.

664
01:01:44,158 --> 01:01:48,788
But I am convinced that it is
a scientifically verified...

665
01:01:48,997 --> 01:01:50,897
...culturally universal one.

666
01:01:51,099 --> 01:01:53,499
Have you ever used Gambutrol
in your studies...

667
01:01:53,701 --> 01:01:57,068
...to test your theory about its effect
on the possession experience?

668
01:01:57,271 --> 01:02:00,729
Absolutely not. That would be
dangerous to the patient.

669
01:02:00,942 --> 01:02:04,708
So this notion of Gambutrol locking
someone in a possessed state...

670
01:02:04,912 --> 01:02:08,245
...the key to your assertion that
her medical treatment harmed Emily...

671
01:02:08,449 --> 01:02:10,576
...this would be your own
pet theory, correct?

672
01:02:10,785 --> 01:02:13,379
- You're just making this one up?
- Objection. Argumentative.

673
01:02:13,588 --> 01:02:14,953
Sustained.

674
01:02:15,156 --> 01:02:18,614
Although I think he's just taking
a page from your book, counselor.

675
01:02:20,561 --> 01:02:22,290
No further questions.

676
01:02:31,406 --> 01:02:32,998
Erin!

677
01:02:33,474 --> 01:02:35,374
I've got a doctor
who wants to testify.

678
01:02:35,910 --> 01:02:37,571
He's an eyewitness, Erin.

679
01:02:37,779 --> 01:02:39,610
He was there.
He was at the exorcism.

680
01:02:39,814 --> 01:02:41,145
- What?
- He called us.

681
01:02:41,749 --> 01:02:44,513
Dr. Graham Cartwright,
Department of Abnormal Psychiatry...

682
01:02:44,719 --> 01:02:46,653
...at St. Mary's Hospital.

683
01:02:53,561 --> 01:02:56,792
Dr. Cartwright. Ring a bell?

684
01:02:57,231 --> 01:02:58,721
Yes.

685
01:02:59,200 --> 01:03:00,997
He was there?

686
01:03:01,636 --> 01:03:04,196
- Yes.
- Father...

687
01:03:05,006 --> 01:03:07,600
...if you want me to defend you,
you've got to give me...

688
01:03:07,809 --> 01:03:09,333
...all the information I need.

689
01:03:09,544 --> 01:03:12,445
With all of this medical testimony
helping the prosecution...

690
01:03:12,647 --> 01:03:16,048
...how could you not tell me
that a doctor attended the exorcism?

691
01:03:18,152 --> 01:03:21,815
He asked that I keep
his involvement confidential...

692
01:03:22,356 --> 01:03:23,755
...and I said I would.

693
01:03:39,507 --> 01:03:41,338
Dr. Cartwright?

694
01:03:43,845 --> 01:03:47,406
I recognize you from those
courtroom drawings on the news.

695
01:03:48,082 --> 01:03:50,744
You're much prettier in real life.

696
01:03:52,186 --> 01:03:55,451
- May I sit?
- Yes, please.

697
01:04:01,929 --> 01:04:03,487
You're losing.

698
01:04:05,867 --> 01:04:08,597
I had hoped Father Moore
wouldn't need me...

699
01:04:08,970 --> 01:04:11,370
...but I don't wanna see him
put away.

700
01:04:13,174 --> 01:04:14,732
How do you know him?

701
01:04:14,942 --> 01:04:18,537
Well, I was his parishioner
at St. Vincent's Church...

702
01:04:18,746 --> 01:04:20,213
...about 15 years ago.

703
01:04:20,815 --> 01:04:24,979
I hadn't seen or heard of him for years
when he called me last fall.

704
01:04:25,386 --> 01:04:27,752
But he needed help, so...

705
01:04:29,524 --> 01:04:31,492
What kind of help, doctor?

706
01:04:31,926 --> 01:04:35,692
He wanted a medical perspective
from a psychiatrist...

707
01:04:35,897 --> 01:04:39,162
...you know, one that he knew,
trusted...

708
01:04:39,367 --> 01:04:44,805
...to observe Emily's physical
and mental state during this...

709
01:04:46,641 --> 01:04:48,575
During the exorcism.

710
01:04:48,943 --> 01:04:50,672
Yeah.

711
01:04:57,351 --> 01:04:58,909
Doctor.

712
01:04:59,954 --> 01:05:01,546
Doctor.

713
01:05:03,591 --> 01:05:05,149
Can you help our case?

714
01:05:07,895 --> 01:05:10,796
That girl was not schizophrenic...

715
01:05:10,998 --> 01:05:14,092
...and she was not epileptic,
or any combination of the two.

716
01:05:14,302 --> 01:05:16,497
I've seen hundreds of people
with those problems.

717
01:05:16,704 --> 01:05:21,038
They can be terrible afflictions,
of course, but they don't scare me.

718
01:05:21,242 --> 01:05:24,109
But what you saw that night in Emily,
that did scare you.

719
01:05:24,312 --> 01:05:26,974
God, if I'd known,
I never would've been there.

720
01:05:30,284 --> 01:05:33,344
I started praying again
since then, you know.

721
01:05:36,591 --> 01:05:40,652
I examined that girl before I drove
back to the city that night.

722
01:05:41,028 --> 01:05:42,461
She was lucid...

723
01:05:42,663 --> 01:05:46,531
...and she was completely aware
of this separate entity inside her.

724
01:05:46,901 --> 01:05:51,964
When she wasn't in his grip, she was
totally herself, completely normal.

725
01:05:52,173 --> 01:05:56,166
The awareness of her alternate mental
state is counterindicative of psychosis.

726
01:05:56,377 --> 01:05:58,004
Crazy people
don't know they're crazy.

727
01:05:58,212 --> 01:05:59,645
That's right.

728
01:06:00,348 --> 01:06:03,374
You'll testify to all of this, in detail?

729
01:06:03,584 --> 01:06:05,108
Everything you saw?

730
01:06:05,319 --> 01:06:08,186
Send me the case files
and tell me when to be in court.

731
01:06:08,389 --> 01:06:10,380
Thank you, doctor.

732
01:06:11,325 --> 01:06:13,088
We need this.

733
01:06:14,228 --> 01:06:17,459
Before he was arrested,
Father Moore sent this to me.

734
01:06:17,665 --> 01:06:20,065
He asked me to take care of it.

735
01:06:21,269 --> 01:06:23,499
It's your burden now.

736
01:06:25,740 --> 01:06:27,469
One more thing.
When you saw Emily...

737
01:06:27,675 --> 01:06:30,667
...did Father Moore ask you
to give her any medical help?

738
01:06:31,245 --> 01:06:35,909
He was already trying to stop her from
injuring herself and urging her to eat.

739
01:06:36,117 --> 01:06:38,745
And I told him, as a doctor,
I couldn't help her.

740
01:06:46,661 --> 01:06:49,027
Dr. Cartwright's going to testify.

741
01:06:54,335 --> 01:06:55,962
Don't you get it?

742
01:06:56,170 --> 01:06:58,400
He's not just an eyewitness
to the exorcism.

743
01:06:58,606 --> 01:07:01,769
He can also refute the prosecution's
medical case. This is huge for us.

744
01:07:01,976 --> 01:07:03,967
When do I get to testify?

745
01:07:04,812 --> 01:07:07,144
I don't know. Let's take this
one step at a time.

746
01:07:07,348 --> 01:07:08,645
No.

747
01:07:08,849 --> 01:07:13,946
What matters most is Emily's story,
which only I can tell.

748
01:07:15,423 --> 01:07:17,448
I understand.

749
01:07:20,695 --> 01:07:22,629
Have you thought about
what I said before?

750
01:07:23,698 --> 01:07:27,600
About dark forces
and demonic attacks?

751
01:07:32,139 --> 01:07:34,334
Yes, I have.

752
01:07:39,947 --> 01:07:43,439
That day, after Briggs testified...

753
01:07:46,153 --> 01:07:47,950
<i>... I was feeling awful.</i>

754
01:07:48,289 --> 01:07:52,123
<i>And I went out for a walk</i>
<i>just to clear my head...</i>

755
01:07:52,326 --> 01:07:56,592
<i>... and I was thinking about</i>
<i>what you said to me. Thinking:</i>

756
01:07:57,331 --> 01:07:59,925
<i>"What if demons really do exist?"</i>

757
01:08:00,134 --> 01:08:03,592
And wondering what that
would mean if I believed that.

758
01:08:04,739 --> 01:08:09,472
Because God knows,
I have my own demons.

759
01:08:11,278 --> 01:08:13,473
And I saw something
lying on the sidewalk.

760
01:08:18,886 --> 01:08:20,478
<i>It was a gold locket...</i>

761
01:08:21,322 --> 01:08:24,780
<i>... with the initials E. C.B.</i>
<i>Engraved on it.</i>

762
01:08:27,928 --> 01:08:30,488
My middle name is Christine.

763
01:08:30,698 --> 01:08:34,065
Erin Christine Bruner.

764
01:08:34,568 --> 01:08:39,471
And of all the people walking by
that day, I found that locket.

765
01:08:39,707 --> 01:08:41,402
What are the chances of that?

766
01:08:42,877 --> 01:08:45,505
I don't know, maybe it was a sign.

767
01:08:45,713 --> 01:08:49,740
Or maybe it was just some
incredible coincidence.

768
01:08:49,950 --> 01:08:52,316
But it made me feel...

769
01:08:52,520 --> 01:08:56,718
...like no matter what mistakes
I've made in the past...

770
01:08:56,924 --> 01:09:00,690
...at that moment, I was exactly
where I was meant to be.

771
01:09:00,895 --> 01:09:03,056
Like I was on the right path.

772
01:09:05,433 --> 01:09:09,164
You sound more like a mystic
than an agnostic.

773
01:09:10,971 --> 01:09:13,235
Are you wearing the locket now?

774
01:09:14,975 --> 01:09:16,203
No.

775
01:09:17,545 --> 01:09:19,308
You should.

776
01:09:24,051 --> 01:09:27,111
The archdiocese
doesn't want you to testify.

777
01:09:29,323 --> 01:09:31,553
They're just afraid
that I'll embarrass them.

778
01:09:31,759 --> 01:09:35,024
Testify to some medieval-sounding
supernatural nonsense.

779
01:09:35,463 --> 01:09:38,023
They're expecting me
to talk you out of it.

780
01:09:38,899 --> 01:09:40,890
I've just decided
I'm not even gonna try.

781
01:09:42,403 --> 01:09:44,132
Why not?

782
01:09:45,106 --> 01:09:47,267
If the archdiocese
wants to avoid embarrassment...

783
01:09:47,475 --> 01:09:50,137
...they need you to walk out of here
a free man.

784
01:09:51,112 --> 01:09:53,478
I believe a jury will find you
sincere and credible...

785
01:09:53,681 --> 01:09:56,514
...and when Dr. Cartwright
corroborates your testimony...

786
01:09:56,717 --> 01:09:59,015
...and refutes the prosecution's
medical arguments...

787
01:09:59,220 --> 01:10:00,847
...we'll get an acquittal.

788
01:10:01,722 --> 01:10:04,088
And everyone will thank me for it.

789
01:10:45,499 --> 01:10:47,194
<i>Emily!</i>

790
01:10:59,980 --> 01:11:01,675
God help me.

791
01:11:09,156 --> 01:11:12,182
Do you swear to tell the truth,
the whole truth, so help you God?

792
01:11:12,393 --> 01:11:13,587
I do.

793
01:11:13,794 --> 01:11:16,160
Father Moore, before you could
perform the exorcism...

794
01:11:16,363 --> 01:11:18,923
...you had to get the sanction
of the Church, correct?

795
01:11:19,133 --> 01:11:21,465
Yes, on October the 27th
of last year...

796
01:11:21,669 --> 01:11:25,469
...I presented my assessment and
recommendation to the archbishop...

797
01:11:25,673 --> 01:11:30,133
...and he authorized the exorcism
that day before I left the office.

798
01:11:30,878 --> 01:11:32,311
Tell us what happened that night.

799
01:11:32,680 --> 01:11:34,409
I drove home.

800
01:11:34,615 --> 01:11:37,846
I sat up till after midnight
studying <i>The Roman Ritual</i>...

801
01:11:38,052 --> 01:11:39,576
...thinking about what lay ahead.

802
01:11:39,787 --> 01:11:41,721
You mean <i>The Roman Ritual</i>
<i>of Exorcism</i>.

803
01:11:41,922 --> 01:11:43,480
A text used by Catholic priests...

804
01:11:43,691 --> 01:11:45,682
...as a guide to performing
the exorcism rite.

805
01:11:45,893 --> 01:11:48,555
Yes, I think I actually fell asleep
with the book in my hand.

806
01:11:48,762 --> 01:11:50,491
What happened next?

807
01:11:50,798 --> 01:11:52,857
<i>I woke up, freezing.</i>

808
01:11:53,601 --> 01:11:56,161
<i>It was exactly 3 a.m.</i>

809
01:11:56,370 --> 01:11:59,066
Three a.m. Is the demonic
witching hour.

810
01:11:59,440 --> 01:12:02,341
It's a way for demons
to mock the Holy Trinity.

811
01:12:02,543 --> 01:12:05,808
It's an inversion of 3 p.m.,
the miracle hour...

812
01:12:06,013 --> 01:12:10,677
...which is traditionally accepted
as the hour of Christ's death.

813
01:12:11,252 --> 01:12:13,686
I thought I smelled
something burning.

814
01:12:15,556 --> 01:12:17,524
<i>Only later did I connect it...</i>

815
01:12:17,925 --> 01:12:20,985
<i>... and I remembered that that same</i>
<i>smell of something burning...</i>

816
01:12:21,195 --> 01:12:23,720
<i>... had been perceived by Emily.</i>

817
01:13:32,966 --> 01:13:38,165
Holy Mary, mother of God,
pray for us sinners, now and...

818
01:13:42,209 --> 01:13:46,873
Pray for us sinners,
now and at the hour of our...

819
01:13:51,652 --> 01:13:53,415
At the hour of...

820
01:14:23,917 --> 01:14:28,445
What do you make of this gesture,
this nod in your direction?

821
01:14:29,490 --> 01:14:34,553
I don't know. Some kind
of acknowledgment, I guess.

822
01:14:35,195 --> 01:14:37,254
That the game is on.

823
01:14:40,567 --> 01:14:43,263
You're really God's gunslinger,
aren't you, Father?

824
01:14:43,470 --> 01:14:46,928
Standing tall and facing the devil
with your prayer book at your side.

825
01:14:47,141 --> 01:14:49,507
Objection, Your Honor.
Counsel's harassing my witness.

826
01:14:49,710 --> 01:14:54,113
Sustained. Mr. Thomas, you know
I won't allow that in my courtroom.

827
01:14:54,314 --> 01:14:56,339
Forgive me, Your Honor.

828
01:14:57,918 --> 01:15:02,184
Father, did you understand this
black-robed figure to be the devil?

829
01:15:02,389 --> 01:15:04,152
I believe it was
a demonic manifestation.

830
01:15:04,358 --> 01:15:06,724
Like the demonic force
you believe possessed Emily?

831
01:15:06,927 --> 01:15:08,895
- Yes.
- Why do you think it appeared to you?

832
01:15:09,096 --> 01:15:11,428
I believe the demonic
can appear as an apparition...

833
01:15:11,632 --> 01:15:14,601
...much like a ghost,
in an attempt to excite our fear.

834
01:15:15,035 --> 01:15:18,095
- Did it excite your fear, Father?
- It scared the hell out of me.

835
01:15:19,039 --> 01:15:21,769
So this night, when you began to
prepare Emily's exorcism...

836
01:15:21,975 --> 01:15:24,409
...was it your first encounter
with this demon ghost?

837
01:15:24,611 --> 01:15:26,476
- Yes.
- Have you seen it again?

838
01:15:30,083 --> 01:15:31,345
I've seen it ever since.

839
01:15:37,024 --> 01:15:39,424
No further questions at this time.

840
01:15:43,931 --> 01:15:45,990
Redirect, Your Honor.

841
01:15:47,901 --> 01:15:50,631
Father Moore, after you received
the bishop's authorization...

842
01:15:50,838 --> 01:15:52,601
...when did you proceed
with an exorcism?

843
01:15:52,806 --> 01:15:54,103
October 31 st.

844
01:15:54,675 --> 01:15:57,109
On Halloween.
Isn't that a bit dramatic?

845
01:15:57,911 --> 01:16:01,142
Halloween tradition is based on
legends throughout history...

846
01:16:01,348 --> 01:16:04,476
...that indicate a real increase
in spiritual activity on that night...

847
01:16:04,685 --> 01:16:07,745
...and I thought we could use the
occasion to draw them into the open.

848
01:16:07,955 --> 01:16:10,116
- The demons, you mean?
- Yes.

849
01:16:10,324 --> 01:16:11,757
Father Moore...

850
01:16:13,494 --> 01:16:15,553
...can you identify this?

851
01:16:15,829 --> 01:16:19,526
It's my tape recorder.
I used it to record the exorcism.

852
01:16:20,234 --> 01:16:22,759
Inside is the tape I made that night.

853
01:16:23,871 --> 01:16:25,668
Why would you make such a tape?

854
01:16:25,873 --> 01:16:27,932
Ever since the technology
has been available...

855
01:16:28,141 --> 01:16:31,577
...exorcists have used tape recorders
to authenticate the ritual...

856
01:16:31,778 --> 01:16:33,473
...and provide a record for review.

857
01:16:33,680 --> 01:16:36,672
I offer into evidence this
cassette recorder and audiotape...

858
01:16:36,884 --> 01:16:40,115
Objection. The people were not aware
of the existence of this tape...

859
01:16:40,320 --> 01:16:41,981
...until last night.
- Neither were we.

860
01:16:42,189 --> 01:16:45,158
This tape is new evidence that came
into our possession yesterday.

861
01:16:45,359 --> 01:16:48,556
We provided counsel for the people
with a transcript of its contents.

862
01:16:48,762 --> 01:16:51,162
You mean this tape was not
given to you by your client?

863
01:16:51,365 --> 01:16:53,890
No, Your Honor. We received it
from a reluctant witness...

864
01:16:54,101 --> 01:16:57,662
...Dr. Graham Cartwright, who will also
be called to testify to its authenticity.

865
01:16:57,871 --> 01:17:00,601
The people will find his name
on the updated witness list...

866
01:17:00,807 --> 01:17:02,468
...we provided to them this morning.

867
01:17:06,847 --> 01:17:09,145
Very well. I'll allow it into evidence.

868
01:17:12,953 --> 01:17:14,716
Father Moore.

869
01:17:16,456 --> 01:17:18,651
Will you play the tape for us now?

870
01:17:26,099 --> 01:17:29,034
<i>This is the exorcism of Emily Rose.</i>

871
01:17:29,536 --> 01:17:32,994
<i>Those present are myself,</i>
<i>Father Richard Moore...</i>

872
01:17:34,074 --> 01:17:37,475
...Nathaniel, Emily's father...

873
01:17:38,545 --> 01:17:41,605
...Jason, her friend...

874
01:17:42,349 --> 01:17:46,979
...a doctor who is here
to monitor Emily during the ritual...

875
01:17:47,721 --> 01:17:49,586
...and Emily herself...

876
01:17:49,790 --> 01:17:53,692
...who has given her permission
for the ritual to be performed.

877
01:17:55,128 --> 01:17:56,891
All right, now listen.

878
01:17:58,966 --> 01:18:02,902
You may say the rosary or any
private prayer for her deliverance...

879
01:18:03,103 --> 01:18:06,095
...when you're not responding
to my words.

880
01:18:06,306 --> 01:18:08,069
Above all...

881
01:18:08,642 --> 01:18:11,406
...do whatever I ask,
without question.

882
01:18:13,380 --> 01:18:15,746
Don't ask it any questions...

883
01:18:15,949 --> 01:18:19,282
...or pay any attention
to what it says.

884
01:18:20,721 --> 01:18:22,086
"It"?

885
01:18:22,289 --> 01:18:24,655
We won't be dealing
with Emily tonight.

886
01:18:29,896 --> 01:18:31,488
Restrain her.

887
01:18:38,839 --> 01:18:42,832
Lord Jesus Christ,
have mercy on us.

888
01:19:04,331 --> 01:19:05,525
It has begun.

889
01:19:06,033 --> 01:19:07,125
Let us pray.

890
01:19:14,207 --> 01:19:16,607
"Because she hopes
in you, my God."

891
01:19:16,810 --> 01:19:19,711
"Send her help from
the holy place, Lord."

892
01:19:20,080 --> 01:19:22,571
"And give her heavenly protection."

893
01:19:22,783 --> 01:19:24,876
"May the Lord be with you."

894
01:19:25,085 --> 01:19:27,451
"And with your spirit."

895
01:19:27,654 --> 01:19:32,785
Our Father, who art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name.

896
01:19:35,529 --> 01:19:36,655
My God. Are you all right?

897
01:19:46,206 --> 01:19:49,642
Thy kingdom come, thy will be done,
on earth as it is in heaven.

898
01:19:49,843 --> 01:19:51,538
I'm fine.

899
01:19:51,745 --> 01:19:54,305
Give us this day our daily bread.

900
01:19:54,514 --> 01:19:59,918
And forgive us our trespasses as we
forgive those that trespass against us.

901
01:20:00,120 --> 01:20:02,020
And lead us not into temptation...

902
01:20:02,222 --> 01:20:06,488
But deliver us from evil!

903
01:20:07,894 --> 01:20:11,352
Who are you, demon?
Tell me your name.

904
01:20:27,748 --> 01:20:31,206
One, two, three, four, five, six.
One, two, three, four, five, six.

905
01:20:31,418 --> 01:20:34,512
Trick or treat.
I give you treats and tricks.

906
01:20:34,721 --> 01:20:37,588
One, two, three, four, five, six.

907
01:20:43,396 --> 01:20:44,727
Father Moore!

908
01:20:55,842 --> 01:20:57,036
Papa!

909
01:21:08,455 --> 01:21:10,184
Emily!

910
01:21:23,503 --> 01:21:25,130
Emily!

911
01:21:26,072 --> 01:21:30,475
She feels so hot, Father!
She's burning up!

912
01:21:34,447 --> 01:21:37,575
Hold her down there on the straw!
Hold her!

913
01:21:42,656 --> 01:21:43,850
Emily!

914
01:21:59,306 --> 01:22:01,968
Doctor! I need you here now.

915
01:22:05,579 --> 01:22:06,773
Watch her vital signs.

916
01:22:07,914 --> 01:22:10,405
In the beginning was the word.

917
01:22:10,617 --> 01:22:12,380
And the word was with God.

918
01:22:12,586 --> 01:22:16,022
And the word was the word,
and what a wonderful word it was.

919
01:22:16,223 --> 01:22:17,554
Through him all things remain.

920
01:22:17,757 --> 01:22:20,351
Without him, nothing was made
that has been made.

921
01:22:22,495 --> 01:22:25,555
And the 70 disciples
returned again with joy, saying:

922
01:22:25,765 --> 01:22:29,496
"Lord, even the devils are subject
unto us through thy name."

923
01:22:29,703 --> 01:22:32,900
Her heart is racing.
It's almost 180 beats a minute.

924
01:22:33,106 --> 01:22:36,872
I beheld Satan as lightning
fall from heaven.

925
01:22:37,811 --> 01:22:41,838
Behold. I give you power to tread on
serpents and scorpions...

926
01:22:42,048 --> 01:22:44,175
...and over all the power
of the enemy.

927
01:22:44,384 --> 01:22:47,444
And nothing shall,
by any means, hurt you.

928
01:23:07,774 --> 01:23:11,870
Get it off! Get it off! Get it off!

929
01:23:19,019 --> 01:23:23,456
Release him, demon. I command you
in the name of our Lord, Jesus Christ.

930
01:23:35,568 --> 01:23:37,126
Tell me your name, wicked one.

931
01:23:39,406 --> 01:23:42,000
He who commands you is he
who ordered you thrown down...

932
01:23:42,208 --> 01:23:44,699
...from the highest heaven
into the depths of hell.

933
01:23:44,911 --> 01:23:49,644
In the name of our Lord, Jesus Christ,
I now command you:

934
01:23:50,116 --> 01:23:51,310
Tell me your name!

935
01:23:53,653 --> 01:23:57,749
Hear, therefore, and fear,
Satan, enemy of the faith.

936
01:23:58,191 --> 01:23:59,783
Give me your name, demon!

937
01:24:00,226 --> 01:24:03,457
Names!

938
01:24:03,663 --> 01:24:06,689
Names!

939
01:24:13,139 --> 01:24:15,334
Ancient serpents...

940
01:24:16,009 --> 01:24:19,445
...depart from this servant of God!

941
01:24:19,846 --> 01:24:22,178
Tell me your six names!

942
01:24:23,350 --> 01:24:27,810
We are the ones who dwell within!

943
01:24:44,971 --> 01:24:47,303
And I am Lucifer...

944
01:24:47,507 --> 01:24:50,340
...the devil in the flesh.

945
01:25:06,259 --> 01:25:07,453
Mr. Rose.

946
01:25:07,660 --> 01:25:09,685
Doctor, help him!

947
01:25:27,313 --> 01:25:29,713
<i>After a few moments,</i>
<i>Mr. Rose revived...</i>

948
01:25:29,916 --> 01:25:32,680
<i>... but the exorcism</i>
<i>had to be abandoned.</i>

949
01:25:33,153 --> 01:25:38,181
Emily was taken to her room
and soon fell into a deep sleep.

950
01:25:38,391 --> 01:25:41,224
The whole thing
was a complete failure.

951
01:25:41,694 --> 01:25:45,152
Describe her behavior from the night
of the failed exorcism...

952
01:25:45,365 --> 01:25:46,957
...until the time of her death.

953
01:25:47,700 --> 01:25:49,463
Violence towards others and herself.

954
01:25:49,669 --> 01:25:52,536
Sometimes she screamed
for hours on end.

955
01:25:52,739 --> 01:25:55,867
She drove her head through windows,
tried to bite...

956
01:25:56,076 --> 01:25:59,273
Tried to bite holes in the walls,
breaking several more of her teeth...

957
01:25:59,479 --> 01:26:01,913
...as you saw in
the postmortem photograph.

958
01:26:02,115 --> 01:26:04,242
- You witnessed this?
- Some of it, yes.

959
01:26:04,451 --> 01:26:06,612
I tried to visit every day...

960
01:26:07,253 --> 01:26:08,811
...and the family told me the rest.

961
01:26:09,022 --> 01:26:10,580
Did you attempt another exorcism?

962
01:26:11,558 --> 01:26:14,254
I wanted to, but Emily refused.

963
01:26:14,461 --> 01:26:16,292
And without the consent
of the possessed...

964
01:26:16,496 --> 01:26:18,930
...the exorcism ritual
can't be performed.

965
01:26:19,132 --> 01:26:20,724
Did you encourage her to eat?

966
01:26:21,367 --> 01:26:23,392
Yes, every time I saw her...

967
01:26:23,603 --> 01:26:26,595
...but the few times she tried,
it seemed like...

968
01:26:27,173 --> 01:26:30,006
Seemed like she couldn't swallow,
or she couldn't keep it down.

969
01:26:30,210 --> 01:26:31,507
What about medical care?

970
01:26:31,711 --> 01:26:35,112
I wanted her to continue. I never said
she should quit seeing her doctors.

971
01:26:35,315 --> 01:26:37,715
That would be wrong.
Medical care is not my field.

972
01:26:37,917 --> 01:26:41,114
But you did suggest she stop
taking the drug Gambutrol.

973
01:26:44,090 --> 01:26:45,785
Yes.

974
01:26:48,328 --> 01:26:51,786
After the exorcism,
she asked for my counsel.

975
01:26:52,198 --> 01:26:54,462
She told me that the drugs
had never helped her.

976
01:26:54,667 --> 01:26:57,500
After all, she was on Gambutrol
during the exorcism...

977
01:26:57,704 --> 01:27:00,195
...when her so-called symptoms
were at their peak.

978
01:27:01,040 --> 01:27:05,739
Ultimately, we both felt that
she was beyond medical care...

979
01:27:05,945 --> 01:27:10,314
...and that she had to see this
through to the end...

980
01:27:10,783 --> 01:27:12,876
...by faith alone.

981
01:27:17,690 --> 01:27:21,057
The dual voices we just heard
on this tape...

982
01:27:21,928 --> 01:27:26,228
...you're certain that they were both
coming from Emily at the same time?

983
01:27:26,432 --> 01:27:27,694
Yes. Yes, I heard them.

984
01:27:27,901 --> 01:27:30,392
Have you tampered
with this tape in any way?

985
01:27:30,803 --> 01:27:32,464
No. No, I have not.

986
01:27:34,007 --> 01:27:36,407
No further questions at this time.

987
01:27:41,181 --> 01:27:42,409
Mr. Thomas.

988
01:27:46,252 --> 01:27:50,382
Father Moore, you consider this tape
to be proof of the supernatural?

989
01:27:51,524 --> 01:27:55,119
I think it's a record
of certain indications...

990
01:27:55,328 --> 01:27:57,193
...that Emily was possessed.

991
01:27:57,397 --> 01:27:59,058
Signs of possession,
you may call them.

992
01:27:59,265 --> 01:28:02,462
By "signs of possession," would you
mean her speaking in languages...

993
01:28:02,669 --> 01:28:04,637
...we might assume
she couldn't possibly know?

994
01:28:04,837 --> 01:28:07,931
And the vocalization of two
distinct voices simultaneously?

995
01:28:08,141 --> 01:28:11,508
Yes. Among other signs that I
observed and described to the court...

996
01:28:11,711 --> 01:28:13,611
...while the tape was playing.
Things I saw.

997
01:28:13,813 --> 01:28:15,280
Things you can't hear
on the tape.

998
01:28:15,481 --> 01:28:17,415
We'll just have to take
your word, won't we?

999
01:28:17,617 --> 01:28:19,244
- Your Honor.
- Mr. Thomas.

1000
01:28:19,819 --> 01:28:22,720
I apologize.
Father, as Emily's parish priest...

1001
01:28:22,922 --> 01:28:25,755
...are you aware that she underwent
advanced catechism training?

1002
01:28:25,959 --> 01:28:27,517
Yes. Yes. Her family is very devout.

1003
01:28:27,727 --> 01:28:31,094
And in that training, did she study
Ancient Greek, Hebrew and Latin?

1004
01:28:31,297 --> 01:28:32,423
Yes, I think that's right.

1005
01:28:32,632 --> 01:28:35,999
Might have even studied Aramaic,
Christ and his disciples' language...

1006
01:28:36,202 --> 01:28:39,660
...which, according to the transcripts,
we also heard on the tape, correct?

1007
01:28:39,872 --> 01:28:42,602
She spoke Aramaic on the tape.
It wasn't part of her training.

1008
01:28:42,809 --> 01:28:45,369
But it was offered as an elective
at her catechism school.

1009
01:28:45,578 --> 01:28:48,411
I have the school's curriculum
here if you'd like to see it.

1010
01:28:48,615 --> 01:28:52,346
No. I'll accept that she might have
been exposed to that language.

1011
01:28:52,552 --> 01:28:54,383
And according to
her high school records...

1012
01:28:54,587 --> 01:28:57,112
...German was the foreign language
she studied there, yes?

1013
01:28:57,323 --> 01:28:58,517
I don't know. If you say so.

1014
01:28:58,725 --> 01:29:02,286
So that covers the strange languages
we heard on the tape, correct?

1015
01:29:03,062 --> 01:29:04,927
Did I miss any?

1016
01:29:06,199 --> 01:29:07,393
- No.
- Good.

1017
01:29:07,600 --> 01:29:09,864
We've already established
you're no medical expert.

1018
01:29:10,069 --> 01:29:11,331
You said it's not your field.

1019
01:29:11,537 --> 01:29:15,234
But are you aware of the dual sets of
vocal cords every human possesses?

1020
01:29:15,541 --> 01:29:16,769
- No.
- Have you heard of...

1021
01:29:16,976 --> 01:29:21,276
...the superior vocal cords, which are
higher than the ones we use to speak?

1022
01:29:21,481 --> 01:29:24,143
No. So you didn't know that
Tibetan monks, for example...

1023
01:29:24,350 --> 01:29:27,080
...as part of their religious training,
teach themselves...

1024
01:29:27,287 --> 01:29:30,688
...to activate both sets
of vocal cords at once?

1025
01:29:30,890 --> 01:29:32,517
No, I didn't know that.

1026
01:29:32,725 --> 01:29:35,353
Well, now that you do know,
would you think it's possible...

1027
01:29:35,561 --> 01:29:37,324
...that Emily, in her psychotic state...

1028
01:29:37,530 --> 01:29:39,794
...might have activated both sets
of vocal cords...

1029
01:29:39,999 --> 01:29:43,400
...so as to achieve the amazing effect
we heard captured on your audiotape?

1030
01:29:43,603 --> 01:29:44,865
Her state was not psychotic.

1031
01:29:45,071 --> 01:29:47,767
Father Moore, you told us
that in the exorcism we heard...

1032
01:29:47,974 --> 01:29:51,375
...you actually saw, once again,
this black-robed figure...

1033
01:29:51,577 --> 01:29:54,205
...or demonic apparition, am I right?
- Yes.

1034
01:29:54,414 --> 01:29:57,008
But we couldn't see him
when you played the tape, correct?

1035
01:29:57,216 --> 01:29:58,706
- No, of course not.
- Of course not.

1036
01:29:58,918 --> 01:30:01,716
So that would be another
supernatural aspect of the exorcism...

1037
01:30:01,921 --> 01:30:05,379
...your tape doesn't prove, correct?
- Yes.

1038
01:30:06,192 --> 01:30:08,160
Where is your dark figure, Father?

1039
01:30:08,361 --> 01:30:10,659
Is he here now?
Do I look like your demon ghost?

1040
01:30:10,863 --> 01:30:12,763
- Your Honor.
- Counselor.

1041
01:30:16,436 --> 01:30:18,301
I have nothing further.

1042
01:30:19,405 --> 01:30:21,305
Does the defense wish to redirect?

1043
01:30:21,507 --> 01:30:24,943
No, Your Honor, but we reserve
the right to recall the witness later.

1044
01:30:25,244 --> 01:30:27,974
Very well.
The witness may step down.

1045
01:30:34,987 --> 01:30:37,785
Your Honor, my next witness
must have been detained.

1046
01:30:37,990 --> 01:30:39,958
If we could take a short recess
so I could...

1047
01:30:40,159 --> 01:30:43,617
You've made this court wait before,
counselor. I'm inclined to...

1048
01:30:43,830 --> 01:30:45,457
Your Honor, please.

1049
01:30:45,665 --> 01:30:48,293
Dr. Cartwright came to us
in good conscience...

1050
01:30:48,501 --> 01:30:51,595
...as an eyewitness to the exorcism
on Father Moore's tape.

1051
01:30:51,804 --> 01:30:54,864
He can substantiate
all of my client's testimony...

1052
01:30:55,074 --> 01:30:58,202
Your Honor, the defense has already
presented its exorcism testimony...

1053
01:30:58,411 --> 01:31:00,971
...in dramatic fashion.
Do we really have to...?

1054
01:31:07,420 --> 01:31:10,878
We have absorbed some
extraordinary testimony today.

1055
01:31:11,391 --> 01:31:14,019
I think we'll take some time
to consider it.

1056
01:31:14,227 --> 01:31:16,889
Court is adjourned
until 9:30 tomorrow morning.

1057
01:31:19,365 --> 01:31:22,266
- You can't find him?
- I went to meet him, he didn't show.

1058
01:31:22,468 --> 01:31:24,459
I called his office, I called his house.

1059
01:31:24,670 --> 01:31:29,300
Okay. Go to the hospital, ask around.
Somebody's gotta know where he is.

1060
01:31:41,988 --> 01:31:43,455
What the hell happened?

1061
01:31:44,991 --> 01:31:47,357
Tell Father Moore I'm sorry.

1062
01:31:47,627 --> 01:31:51,586
Tell him I know the demons are real
and I admire his courage...

1063
01:31:51,798 --> 01:31:53,959
...for standing and speaking
against them.

1064
01:31:54,300 --> 01:31:57,030
Tell him I know what they can do.

1065
01:32:19,625 --> 01:32:22,492
- Cartwright's dead.
- I heard.

1066
01:32:23,596 --> 01:32:25,086
Are you drunk?

1067
01:32:26,732 --> 01:32:30,293
- Not yet, but I'm working on it.
- Have you seen this?

1068
01:32:35,741 --> 01:32:37,675
- What the hell were you thinking?
- Karl...

1069
01:32:37,877 --> 01:32:40,209
You told me you'd talk him out
of testifying.

1070
01:32:40,413 --> 01:32:42,711
Instead, you put on a freak show
with taped demons...

1071
01:32:42,915 --> 01:32:44,678
...and a dead girl
speaking in tongues...

1072
01:32:44,884 --> 01:32:49,082
...and your client testifies that the
archbishop sanctioned the exorcism.

1073
01:32:49,722 --> 01:32:51,781
We'll be lucky if
the archdiocese isn't named...

1074
01:32:51,991 --> 01:32:54,425
I had a doctor
who was gonna corroborate.

1075
01:32:54,627 --> 01:32:57,596
Besides that, Father Moore's
testimony's crucial to his defense.

1076
01:32:57,797 --> 01:33:00,322
Did you forget the archdiocese
is paying for this defense?

1077
01:33:00,533 --> 01:33:02,296
The archdiocese isn't on trial.

1078
01:33:04,136 --> 01:33:06,604
I swore an oath to do
what's best for my client.

1079
01:33:06,806 --> 01:33:08,899
Spare me the law school pieties,
Bruner.

1080
01:33:09,108 --> 01:33:11,133
You cashed in your conscience
at the door.

1081
01:33:11,344 --> 01:33:14,245
- People can change.
- Like James Van Hopper?

1082
01:33:17,850 --> 01:33:19,442
It's not over.

1083
01:33:20,219 --> 01:33:21,846
I can put Mr. Rose on the stand...

1084
01:33:22,054 --> 01:33:24,215
...to corroborate Father Moore
about the exorcism.

1085
01:33:24,423 --> 01:33:27,221
And there are the girls.
Her sister Alice, she saw part of it.

1086
01:33:27,426 --> 01:33:30,361
They all look like superstitious rubes.
They've got no credibility.

1087
01:33:30,563 --> 01:33:31,894
Thomas will rip them to pieces.

1088
01:33:32,098 --> 01:33:34,794
You'll be worse off than you are now,
if that's possible.

1089
01:33:35,801 --> 01:33:37,564
You're gonna replace me
on this case.

1090
01:33:38,337 --> 01:33:40,396
You've screwed it up
beyond all repair.

1091
01:33:41,040 --> 01:33:43,406
But the archdiocese feels
that replacing you now...

1092
01:33:43,609 --> 01:33:46,476
...would only draw more
unnecessary attention to the trial.

1093
01:33:46,679 --> 01:33:48,203
But just so we're clear, Bruner...

1094
01:33:48,948 --> 01:33:53,146
...if you put that priest
on the stand again, I will fire you.

1095
01:34:20,413 --> 01:34:21,744
You've been crying.

1096
01:34:25,184 --> 01:34:28,244
- Dr. Cartwright is dead.
- What?

1097
01:34:29,288 --> 01:34:33,520
He was killed.
There was an accident. I'm sorry.

1098
01:34:36,429 --> 01:34:38,522
I know he was your friend.

1099
01:34:42,535 --> 01:34:44,025
We've lost.

1100
01:34:46,305 --> 01:34:48,739
Without his testimony, it's over.

1101
01:34:49,976 --> 01:34:51,500
No.

1102
01:34:51,711 --> 01:34:56,045
No, no, no, it isn't over. We're telling
Emily's story. That's what matters.

1103
01:34:56,248 --> 01:34:58,409
- It can't be worth all this.
- Yes, it is worth it.

1104
01:34:58,618 --> 01:35:01,644
Just let me go back on the stand
and tell the rest of the story.

1105
01:35:01,854 --> 01:35:03,981
- I can't do that.
- You must!

1106
01:35:04,557 --> 01:35:06,286
You must.

1107
01:35:11,564 --> 01:35:16,592
Erin, you once said that you felt
you were on the right path.

1108
01:35:17,703 --> 01:35:20,729
Don't stray from that path.

1109
01:35:22,074 --> 01:35:23,735
Here, take this.

1110
01:35:23,943 --> 01:35:26,275
- What is this?
- Just read it.

1111
01:35:26,479 --> 01:35:29,846
And then decide
what you want to do.

1112
01:35:31,350 --> 01:35:36,287
<i>I saw your eyes today in court when</i>
<i>I explained the significance of 3 a.m.</i>

1113
01:35:37,023 --> 01:35:43,087
<i>It's not going to stop</i>
<i>until Emily's story is told.</i>

1114
01:36:24,570 --> 01:36:26,504
Are you gonna make a statement?

1115
01:36:28,841 --> 01:36:30,866
Do you believe it was the devil?

1116
01:36:42,421 --> 01:36:45,049
Is the defense ready to proceed?

1117
01:36:45,257 --> 01:36:49,125
Yes, Your Honor. The defense
recalls Father Richard Moore.

1118
01:36:56,502 --> 01:36:59,801
The witness is reminded
that he is still under oath.

1119
01:37:09,315 --> 01:37:12,478
- When did you last see Emily alive?
- The night before she died.

1120
01:37:12,685 --> 01:37:15,950
Her mother, Maria, called me
and said that Emily had asked for me.

1121
01:37:16,155 --> 01:37:18,749
- Why did she ask to see you?
- To give me this.

1122
01:37:19,258 --> 01:37:21,556
Did Emily explain to you
the letter's significance?

1123
01:37:21,994 --> 01:37:27,057
Yes. She said she'd written it the
morning after the failed exorcism...

1124
01:37:27,366 --> 01:37:29,732
...and that it was important
for me to share.

1125
01:37:33,773 --> 01:37:36,606
Father Moore,
was Emily a good person?

1126
01:37:38,210 --> 01:37:43,512
I believe that one day
Emily will be recognized as a saint.

1127
01:37:44,617 --> 01:37:47,415
- So she loved God.
- Yes. She was very devout.

1128
01:37:48,454 --> 01:37:50,388
Father Moore, if Emily loved God...

1129
01:37:50,589 --> 01:37:53,285
...if she was so good and so devout,
why do you think God...

1130
01:37:53,492 --> 01:37:55,187
...allowed this to happen?
- Objection.

1131
01:37:55,394 --> 01:37:57,055
What is the relevance
of that question?

1132
01:37:57,263 --> 01:37:59,458
Father Moore's belief
in this matter is crucial...

1133
01:37:59,665 --> 01:38:02,657
...in establishing his and Emily's
understanding of her condition.

1134
01:38:02,868 --> 01:38:05,837
And that mutual understanding
is paramount in determining...

1135
01:38:06,038 --> 01:38:08,233
...whether Father Moore was,
in fact, negligent.

1136
01:38:11,010 --> 01:38:12,204
I'm going to allow it.

1137
01:38:12,411 --> 01:38:14,936
Your Honor, you're not really gonna
let someone testify...

1138
01:38:15,147 --> 01:38:18,310
...about why God would allow
the death of a young girl?

1139
01:38:18,517 --> 01:38:21,008
The objection has been overruled.

1140
01:38:21,554 --> 01:38:23,351
Again, Father Moore:

1141
01:38:24,890 --> 01:38:29,384
Why did God allow Emily to become
possessed by demons and then die?

1142
01:38:30,062 --> 01:38:32,155
I can let Emily answer that.

1143
01:38:36,669 --> 01:38:39,661
"Last night, on Allhallows' Eve...

1144
01:38:39,872 --> 01:38:44,275
...Father Moore tried to cast
six demons from my body.

1145
01:38:44,944 --> 01:38:46,707
They refused to go.

1146
01:38:47,947 --> 01:38:50,415
After the attempted exorcism..."

1147
01:38:50,783 --> 01:38:55,413
<i>I was taken to my room,</i>
<i>and I fell into a deep sleep.</i>

1148
01:38:57,289 --> 01:39:02,317
<i>I awoke a few hours later,</i>
<i>hearing a voice calling out my name.</i>

1149
01:40:16,869 --> 01:40:20,168
<i>"Again, I heard a voice</i>
<i>calling my name.</i>

1150
01:40:20,773 --> 01:40:23,936
It was the Blessed Holy Mother
of God.

1151
01:40:24,977 --> 01:40:27,104
And when I looked at her...

1152
01:40:27,713 --> 01:40:30,944
...she smiled at me and said:

1153
01:40:31,750 --> 01:40:34,913
'Emily, heaven is not blind
to your pain."'

1154
01:40:35,120 --> 01:40:38,612
She said the Virgin Mary spoke to her
in the middle of a field?

1155
01:40:39,158 --> 01:40:41,524
- Yes.
- And do you believe her?

1156
01:40:41,727 --> 01:40:43,627
I believe Emily spoke the truth.

1157
01:40:45,297 --> 01:40:46,662
Please continue.

1158
01:40:49,234 --> 01:40:53,432
<i>"I asked the Blessed Mother,</i>
<i>'Why do I suffer like this?"'</i>

1159
01:40:54,073 --> 01:40:57,042
Why did the demons
not leave me tonight?

1160
01:40:58,510 --> 01:41:01,809
<i>"She said, 'I am sorry, Emily.</i>

1161
01:41:02,081 --> 01:41:05,141
<i>The demons are going to stay</i>
<i>where they are. '</i>

1162
01:41:05,985 --> 01:41:09,284
<i>Then she said,</i>
<i>'You can come with me in peace...</i>

1163
01:41:09,755 --> 01:41:12,246
<i>... free of your bodily form...</i>

1164
01:41:12,791 --> 01:41:15,885
<i>... or you can choose</i>
<i>to continue this.</i>

1165
01:41:17,296 --> 01:41:19,230
<i>You will suffer greatly.</i>

1166
01:41:19,431 --> 01:41:25,097
<i>But through you, many will come to</i>
<i>see that the realm of the spirit is real.</i>

1167
01:41:27,172 --> 01:41:29,970
<i>The choice is yours. "'</i>

1168
01:41:37,850 --> 01:41:39,909
I choose to stay.

1169
01:42:09,715 --> 01:42:13,879
"In the end,
good will triumph over evil.

1170
01:42:14,686 --> 01:42:16,847
Through my experience...

1171
01:42:17,423 --> 01:42:20,256
...people will know
that demons are real.

1172
01:42:22,528 --> 01:42:26,396
People say that God is dead.

1173
01:42:29,068 --> 01:42:31,536
But how can they think that...

1174
01:42:32,104 --> 01:42:34,163
...if I show them the devil?"

1175
01:42:39,778 --> 01:42:43,737
Did you see these wounds on both
of Emily's hands and both feet?

1176
01:42:43,949 --> 01:42:48,886
Yes. Yes, the wounds
lasted for some time.

1177
01:42:49,088 --> 01:42:53,286
And did you attach any supernatural
significance to these wounds?

1178
01:42:53,692 --> 01:42:57,594
I believe they were stigmata.

1179
01:42:57,796 --> 01:42:59,764
By that, you mean
supernatural injuries...

1180
01:42:59,965 --> 01:43:02,934
...that correspond to the crucifixion
wounds of Jesus Christ?

1181
01:43:03,135 --> 01:43:04,762
Yes.

1182
01:43:05,938 --> 01:43:12,104
Stigmata are a sign, a mark
indicating one is touched by God.

1183
01:43:16,014 --> 01:43:20,474
After that night, why do you think
Emily refused another exorcism?

1184
01:43:21,720 --> 01:43:25,121
I believe she'd accepted her fate.

1185
01:43:27,559 --> 01:43:30,585
Is there anything else
you'd like to say about Emily?

1186
01:43:34,833 --> 01:43:36,232
No.

1187
01:43:39,304 --> 01:43:40,965
The defense rests.

1188
01:43:50,015 --> 01:43:52,415
Father Moore attaches
divine significance...

1189
01:43:52,618 --> 01:43:56,145
...to the wounds
on Emily's hands and feet.

1190
01:43:56,355 --> 01:43:57,788
Why?

1191
01:43:59,158 --> 01:44:03,117
Because he sees them as confirmation
of what he wants to believe.

1192
01:44:04,396 --> 01:44:07,661
That Emily was a saint,
touched by the hand of God.

1193
01:44:08,667 --> 01:44:12,228
I'm afraid the truth
is far less inspiring.

1194
01:44:12,905 --> 01:44:18,207
Because the truth is, by the time
these miraculous wounds appeared...

1195
01:44:18,744 --> 01:44:21,542
...Emily had already shown
a tendency to injure herself...

1196
01:44:21,747 --> 01:44:25,012
...and simply did so again
on one of the barbed-wire fences...

1197
01:44:25,217 --> 01:44:28,550
...surrounding the Rose family farm.

1198
01:44:33,492 --> 01:44:39,727
Father Moore's beliefs are based on
archaic and irrational superstition.

1199
01:44:39,932 --> 01:44:42,924
Emily suffered
because she was sick...

1200
01:44:44,336 --> 01:44:46,065
...not because she was a saint.

1201
01:44:48,373 --> 01:44:52,002
I'm a man of faith.
And I am also a man of facts.

1202
01:44:52,678 --> 01:44:58,241
And in here,
facts are what must matter.

1203
01:44:59,585 --> 01:45:02,053
And these are the facts of this case:

1204
01:45:02,888 --> 01:45:07,154
Emily Rose had epilepsy,
which caused psychosis.

1205
01:45:07,526 --> 01:45:11,053
And, given time,
medicine would have cured her.

1206
01:45:11,263 --> 01:45:15,700
But it didn't. Why? Because Father
Richard Moore convinced Emily...

1207
01:45:15,901 --> 01:45:20,338
...that she wasn't ill,
that she didn't need medicine.

1208
01:45:20,539 --> 01:45:23,337
And in the weeks
leading up to her death...

1209
01:45:23,542 --> 01:45:27,603
...when she was clearly in need
of medical treatment...

1210
01:45:28,280 --> 01:45:30,510
...he failed to have her hospitalized.

1211
01:45:40,225 --> 01:45:42,090
So...

1212
01:45:42,861 --> 01:45:46,058
...the defense has given us
an extraordinary...

1213
01:45:46,531 --> 01:45:51,230
...creative explanation
for the events that led to this.

1214
01:45:51,737 --> 01:45:58,074
Ladies and gentlemen,
don't you believe it.

1215
01:45:58,577 --> 01:46:03,480
Because the fact is, it wasn't the devil
that did this to Emily Rose.

1216
01:46:07,286 --> 01:46:08,844
It was the defendant.

1217
01:46:29,941 --> 01:46:31,533
Counselor.

1218
01:46:37,215 --> 01:46:40,844
Ethan Thomas calls himself
a man of faith.

1219
01:46:46,258 --> 01:46:48,988
I, on the other hand,
am a woman of doubt.

1220
01:46:53,131 --> 01:46:55,258
Angels and demons.

1221
01:46:56,101 --> 01:46:57,966
God and the devil.

1222
01:47:02,007 --> 01:47:05,374
These things either exist,
or they do not exist.

1223
01:47:08,113 --> 01:47:09,808
Are we all alone in this life?

1224
01:47:10,482 --> 01:47:12,541
Or are we not alone?

1225
01:47:13,452 --> 01:47:16,250
Either thought is astonishing.

1226
01:47:19,124 --> 01:47:23,254
Do I really believe that this tragedy
is the work of the devil?

1227
01:47:23,462 --> 01:47:25,225
To be honest, I don't know.

1228
01:47:26,898 --> 01:47:29,628
But I cannot deny that it's possible.

1229
01:47:30,302 --> 01:47:32,099
The prosecution
wants you to believe...

1230
01:47:32,304 --> 01:47:35,603
...that Emily's psychotic
epileptic disorder was a fact...

1231
01:47:35,807 --> 01:47:39,903
...because facts leave no room
for reasonable doubt.

1232
01:47:40,112 --> 01:47:42,342
But this trial isn't about facts.

1233
01:47:43,281 --> 01:47:46,045
This trial is about possibilities.

1234
01:47:46,618 --> 01:47:49,348
Is it a fact that Emily
was a hypersensitive...

1235
01:47:49,554 --> 01:47:51,044
...as Dr. Adani suggests?

1236
01:47:51,256 --> 01:47:56,956
A person who's more likely, by her
very nature, to become possessed?

1237
01:47:58,296 --> 01:48:02,198
I can't say that, but the question is:

1238
01:48:02,868 --> 01:48:04,062
Is it possible?

1239
01:48:06,304 --> 01:48:09,967
Is it a fact that Gambutrol
anesthetized Emily's brain...

1240
01:48:10,175 --> 01:48:13,611
...so that the exorcism ritual
was rendered ineffective?

1241
01:48:15,847 --> 01:48:17,644
I can't be sure of that.

1242
01:48:20,051 --> 01:48:21,279
But is it possible?

1243
01:48:22,988 --> 01:48:27,254
Is it a fact that Emily
was beloved by God?

1244
01:48:29,161 --> 01:48:32,824
And that after her exorcism,
she chose to suffer till the end...

1245
01:48:33,031 --> 01:48:35,932
...so that we might believe
in a more magical world?

1246
01:48:36,134 --> 01:48:39,797
A world where the spiritual realm
really exists?

1247
01:48:40,505 --> 01:48:42,473
I can't say that's a fact.

1248
01:48:43,675 --> 01:48:45,302
But ask yourself:

1249
01:48:47,679 --> 01:48:48,941
Is it possible?

1250
01:48:50,615 --> 01:48:52,674
It's what Emily believed.

1251
01:48:52,884 --> 01:48:54,579
It's what Father Moore believed.

1252
01:48:54,786 --> 01:48:59,382
And that sincere belief is what
determined her choices and his.

1253
01:48:59,591 --> 01:49:03,322
Now, for the most
important question:

1254
01:49:04,830 --> 01:49:07,492
Is Father Richard Moore guilty...

1255
01:49:07,699 --> 01:49:11,430
...beyond a reasonable doubt,
of negligent homicide?

1256
01:49:11,970 --> 01:49:16,839
Did he, in fact, neglect
Emily's needs in such a way...

1257
01:49:17,042 --> 01:49:19,442
...that her death
is now on his hands?

1258
01:49:19,644 --> 01:49:23,671
No! That is not a fact.

1259
01:49:23,882 --> 01:49:26,578
It is not a fact
that Emily was epileptic.

1260
01:49:26,785 --> 01:49:31,188
It is not a fact
that she was psychotic.

1261
01:49:31,389 --> 01:49:32,856
Facts...

1262
01:49:33,592 --> 01:49:36,857
...leave no room for possibilities.

1263
01:49:38,330 --> 01:49:39,695
The only fact...

1264
01:49:39,898 --> 01:49:44,961
...the only thing I know
beyond a doubt in this case...

1265
01:49:45,170 --> 01:49:48,662
...is that Father Moore
loved Emily with his whole heart.

1266
01:49:49,074 --> 01:49:52,373
He did everything in his power
to help her.

1267
01:49:52,577 --> 01:49:57,310
He has risked his very freedom
so we could hear her story.

1268
01:50:04,289 --> 01:50:05,813
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury...

1269
01:50:06,024 --> 01:50:09,357
...in my job I sometimes
have to defend bad men.

1270
01:50:10,762 --> 01:50:13,663
Father Richard Moore
is not one of them.

1271
01:50:16,868 --> 01:50:18,733
Don't send a good man to prison.

1272
01:50:18,937 --> 01:50:21,997
I'm not asking that you believe
everything that Father Moore believes.

1273
01:50:22,207 --> 01:50:25,608
I'm simply asking that you believe
in Father Moore.

1274
01:50:42,727 --> 01:50:44,752
Madam Foreman,
has the jury reached a verdict?

1275
01:50:45,096 --> 01:50:46,620
We have, Your Honor.

1276
01:50:58,777 --> 01:51:00,870
Please read the verdict out loud.

1277
01:51:05,483 --> 01:51:08,543
"In the case of <i>The People</i>
<i>v. Father Richard Moore</i>...

1278
01:51:08,753 --> 01:51:11,483
...we, the jury, find the defendant...

1279
01:51:11,690 --> 01:51:14,591
...guilty of negligent homicide."

1280
01:51:16,428 --> 01:51:18,828
The court thanks the jury
for its service.

1281
01:51:20,131 --> 01:51:24,124
Sentencing for this case
will be set for April 3rd.

1282
01:51:24,336 --> 01:51:26,463
Your Honor, if it pleases the court...

1283
01:51:26,671 --> 01:51:28,832
...Father Moore requested
at the start of trial...

1284
01:51:29,040 --> 01:51:31,804
...that if found guilty,
he would be sentenced immediately.

1285
01:51:32,010 --> 01:51:33,944
Yes, I recall that.

1286
01:51:34,145 --> 01:51:38,309
Does the prosecution have any
objection to expedited sentencing?

1287
01:51:39,351 --> 01:51:40,841
Very well.

1288
01:51:44,623 --> 01:51:47,615
Father Richard Moore,
do you understand this sentence...

1289
01:51:47,826 --> 01:51:50,454
...which has been found against you?
- Yes, Your Honor.

1290
01:51:50,662 --> 01:51:52,994
And do you understand
the gravity of this crime?

1291
01:51:53,198 --> 01:51:57,658
That you may, under the law, be
sentenced to a term of up to 10 years?

1292
01:51:57,869 --> 01:51:59,166
Yes, I do.

1293
01:51:59,371 --> 01:52:01,271
Are there any statements
you wish to make...

1294
01:52:01,473 --> 01:52:03,031
...before I impose this sentence?

1295
01:52:03,241 --> 01:52:05,106
- No, Your Honor.
- Very well.

1296
01:52:05,310 --> 01:52:07,403
Excuse me, Your Honor...

1297
01:52:07,612 --> 01:52:09,978
...but the jury would like to make
a recommendation...

1298
01:52:10,181 --> 01:52:12,012
...regarding the sentence.
- Objection.

1299
01:52:12,517 --> 01:52:13,984
Sit down, counselor.

1300
01:52:14,185 --> 01:52:17,677
It's only a recommendation,
and I would like to hear it.

1301
01:52:20,191 --> 01:52:22,682
We recommend a sentence
of time served.

1302
01:52:32,837 --> 01:52:34,134
I'll accept that.

1303
01:52:39,177 --> 01:52:40,667
You are guilty, Father Moore.

1304
01:52:41,946 --> 01:52:43,675
And you are free to go.

1305
01:52:45,050 --> 01:52:48,019
- This court is dismissed.
- All rise.

1306
01:52:56,061 --> 01:52:57,358
Thank you.

1307
01:53:24,556 --> 01:53:27,320
Well, you shocked us all.

1308
01:53:27,926 --> 01:53:30,326
Everyone at the firm sees this
as another victory.

1309
01:53:30,528 --> 01:53:32,553
The archdiocese is pleased.

1310
01:53:32,764 --> 01:53:35,631
They feel the trial has raised
public interest in the Church.

1311
01:53:35,834 --> 01:53:37,563
Have you seen the news?

1312
01:53:37,769 --> 01:53:40,294
There's our priest,
leaving the courthouse a free man...

1313
01:53:40,505 --> 01:53:42,132
...right next to you.

1314
01:53:42,540 --> 01:53:44,735
Just like James Van Hopper.

1315
01:53:46,611 --> 01:53:48,545
All right, I'll say it. I was wrong.

1316
01:53:48,847 --> 01:53:50,212
But I'm ready to make it right.

1317
01:53:50,849 --> 01:53:53,545
I'm offering you
a full partnership in the firm.

1318
01:53:57,255 --> 01:53:58,745
Keep it.

1319
01:54:23,181 --> 01:54:25,877
Will you be able to return
to your parish?

1320
01:54:29,287 --> 01:54:30,948
I can't go back.

1321
01:54:31,389 --> 01:54:32,947
Not now.

1322
01:54:35,226 --> 01:54:37,126
Once you've looked
into the darkness...

1323
01:54:38,396 --> 01:54:41,797
...I think you carry it with you
for the rest of your life.

1324
01:54:46,104 --> 01:54:47,628
What about you?

1325
01:54:50,141 --> 01:54:52,769
I believe you've seen
the darkness too.

1326
01:54:56,414 --> 01:54:58,075
I don't know.

1327
01:55:00,585 --> 01:55:02,849
I'm not sure what I've seen.

1328
01:55:11,896 --> 01:55:15,297
- Who chose the epitaph?
- I did.

1329
01:55:16,201 --> 01:55:20,069
It's from the second chapter
of Philippians, verse 12.

1330
01:55:20,738 --> 01:55:24,139
Emily recited it to me
the night before she died.
