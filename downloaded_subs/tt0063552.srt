1
00:01:04,523 --> 00:01:06,125
Grauman's
Chinese theater in Hollywood,

2
00:01:06,149 --> 00:01:07,429
here comes, yes,
I believe it is.

3
00:01:07,526 --> 00:01:09,016
It is, it's Katharine packard.

4
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:50,093
Turning to the local news,

5
00:03:51,523 --> 00:03:53,935
another dismembered body of a
Hollywood woman was discovered

6
00:03:54,276 --> 00:03:56,813
in the Hollywood
hills, late yesterday.

7
00:03:57,154 --> 00:03:59,074
Homicide investigators
believe she was the victim

8
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:01,119
of the same psychopathic
killer who has murdered

9
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:04,028
and dismembered a number
of middle-aged women

10
00:04:04,369 --> 00:04:05,369
in the Hollywood area.

11
00:04:06,705 --> 00:04:08,320
Property owners voiced
their disapproval

12
00:04:08,665 --> 00:04:10,621
of the disclosed
increases in property tax.

13
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:12,699
Today, an angry
administration is adhering

14
00:04:13,044 --> 00:04:15,706
to the state bill
that's happening.

15
00:05:14,564 --> 00:05:17,180
Oh.

16
00:07:15,644 --> 00:07:16,844
She never gets sick,

17
00:07:16,937 --> 00:07:18,577
except one time, on
the flight to Detroit,

18
00:07:18,897 --> 00:07:21,058
she had one of those
breaded hot dogs, you know.

19
00:07:38,249 --> 00:07:42,162
Folks, this is the home
of Katharine packard,

20
00:07:42,504 --> 00:07:45,462
one of the most famous stars
of the motion picture screen.

21
00:07:45,799 --> 00:07:49,291
Happily retired from the glamor
of the motion picture world,

22
00:07:49,636 --> 00:07:51,297
she now devotes
her days of leisure

23
00:07:51,638 --> 00:07:55,881
to benevolent social work and
her pet Hollywood charities.

24
00:07:56,226 --> 00:07:58,057
This home was built at a cost

25
00:07:58,395 --> 00:08:00,056
of over half a million dollars,

26
00:08:00,355 --> 00:08:02,971
once a scene of lavish
Hollywood parties.

27
00:08:04,359 --> 00:08:04,939
But she never gets sick

28
00:08:05,276 --> 00:08:06,436
unless she has apple juice.

29
00:08:24,963 --> 00:08:28,080
Just as much now

30
00:08:28,425 --> 00:08:30,916
that I'm gonna be a star,
again, as I did before.

31
00:08:31,261 --> 00:08:35,470
Everyone in Hollywood's gonna
be, absolutely everyone,

32
00:08:35,807 --> 00:08:39,049
and it wouldn't be right
without you, would it, darling?

33
00:08:39,394 --> 00:08:41,806
It's a real comeback.

34
00:08:42,105 --> 00:08:45,142
So you see, you simply must
come to my little party.

35
00:08:46,484 --> 00:08:51,194
Yes, oh, yes, darling, Ava,
Clark, yes, oh!

36
00:08:53,199 --> 00:08:54,199
Must run!

37
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:58,076
Ooh.

38
00:08:58,413 --> 00:09:02,406
J Dee, Dee, Dee, dah, dum,
da-dum, Dee, yah, yah

39
00:09:02,751 --> 00:09:05,208
oh, just one more
glass of personality.

40
00:09:09,883 --> 00:09:11,498
What happened to you?

41
00:09:14,179 --> 00:09:18,013
To my dear, loving,
loyal friends.

42
00:09:19,476 --> 00:09:20,476
Ah!

43
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:25,230
Let's go!

44
00:09:26,691 --> 00:09:28,773
J Dee, dum, dum,
da, la, la, la, la

45
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:32,068
oh not like a start,

46
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:33,485
like a star.

47
00:09:54,719 --> 00:09:56,505
Oh boy, you came.

48
00:09:56,846 --> 00:09:59,337
How wonderful of you
all to have come.

49
00:09:59,682 --> 00:10:02,298
I can't tell you how happy I am.

50
00:10:02,644 --> 00:10:05,135
I can't believe that
you're all here.

51
00:10:05,438 --> 00:10:08,896
Every one of you, I'm
glad that I had found you.

52
00:10:09,234 --> 00:10:11,850
Oh, it's so
wonderful to see you.

53
00:10:12,195 --> 00:10:14,356
Dickie, you did
fly in from Europe.

54
00:10:14,697 --> 00:10:15,937
Oh, she looks divine.

55
00:10:16,241 --> 00:10:17,241
Thank you, all!

56
00:10:17,575 --> 00:10:20,988
And to you, Felix, you
know I gave her the brush,

57
00:10:21,329 --> 00:10:22,569
just for my carpet.

58
00:10:23,498 --> 00:10:25,409
I'm so happy I could cry.

59
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:27,186
She looks stunning tonight.

60
00:10:27,210 --> 00:10:28,370
She looks lovely.

61
00:10:52,944 --> 00:10:54,864
Oh, Lee, I'm glad I
caught you before you left.

62
00:10:54,904 --> 00:10:55,904
How is she?

63
00:10:56,197 --> 00:10:57,383
Well, she's broken
her lower tibia.

64
00:10:57,407 --> 00:10:58,447
Oh, what does that mean?

65
00:10:58,533 --> 00:11:00,093
Well, she'll be in
a cast for a while,

66
00:11:00,243 --> 00:11:00,732
but she'll be all right.

67
00:11:01,077 --> 00:11:01,736
She was drinking?

68
00:11:02,078 --> 00:11:02,737
Yes.

69
00:11:03,079 --> 00:11:04,239
Now I've ordered a wheelchair

70
00:11:04,289 --> 00:11:06,996
and the registry is
sending over a nurse.

71
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:08,333
We'll get her on crutches

72
00:11:08,585 --> 00:11:09,945
and keep her as
active as possible.

73
00:11:10,086 --> 00:11:11,188
Well, I'll see if
I can cheer her up.

74
00:11:11,212 --> 00:11:12,212
Thanks, Lee.

75
00:11:37,155 --> 00:11:38,155
Hello, ira.

76
00:11:38,406 --> 00:11:39,406
It's cold in here.

77
00:11:39,741 --> 00:11:41,343
For god's sake, why don't
you turn on some heat?

78
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:41,947
I think you should know

79
00:11:42,285 --> 00:11:42,944
that Katharine... - I know.

80
00:11:43,286 --> 00:11:44,286
Lee's already told me.

81
00:11:44,579 --> 00:11:46,991
Well, I can't watch
her every moment.

82
00:11:47,332 --> 00:11:50,074
If I may say so, I don't
think it's good for her

83
00:11:50,418 --> 00:11:52,750
to stay up in her room, all
the time, like she does.

84
00:11:53,087 --> 00:11:53,701
Well, let's get her some films

85
00:11:54,047 --> 00:11:55,662
to see in the projection room.

86
00:11:56,007 --> 00:11:57,527
Leslie, I'd be careful
about the pills.

87
00:11:57,634 --> 00:11:58,794
Don't leave anything up there

88
00:11:58,968 --> 00:12:00,549
that she could use
to harm herself.

89
00:12:00,887 --> 00:12:01,887
I've thought of that.

90
00:12:03,348 --> 00:12:04,348
There's nothing.

91
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,716
Well, I better
get up and see her.

92
00:12:35,505 --> 00:12:36,836
Katharine, please.

93
00:12:37,173 --> 00:12:38,173
Stop.

94
00:12:38,424 --> 00:12:40,289
- I'm only interested in...
- Ira.

95
00:12:42,595 --> 00:12:43,595
I'm tired.

96
00:12:45,431 --> 00:12:46,967
I'm awfully tired.

97
00:12:49,143 --> 00:12:50,383
Forgive me.

98
00:12:50,728 --> 00:12:52,639
I was going to say
that I am only interested

99
00:12:52,981 --> 00:12:54,846
in your, in your welfare.

100
00:12:56,317 --> 00:12:57,317
I know.

101
00:12:58,736 --> 00:13:02,445
You've always been so damned
interested in my welfare.

102
00:13:03,574 --> 00:13:04,859
Ira!

103
00:13:05,201 --> 00:13:06,407
Yes?

104
00:13:06,744 --> 00:13:08,280
You're an angel for coming by.

105
00:13:14,585 --> 00:13:16,305
Nick, take me
to the club, will you?

106
00:13:38,234 --> 00:13:39,565
Yes?

107
00:13:39,902 --> 00:13:42,109
My name is Hardy,
Laurel n. Hardy.

108
00:13:44,157 --> 00:13:45,988
Are you from the registry?

109
00:13:46,326 --> 00:13:47,532
Yeah.

110
00:13:47,869 --> 00:13:50,076
Oh, uh, come in, Mr. Hardy.

111
00:13:51,956 --> 00:13:53,947
Miss packard's secretary
will interview you.

112
00:13:54,292 --> 00:13:57,284
I didn't know that Katharine
packard was still around.

113
00:13:57,628 --> 00:13:58,242
Around?

114
00:13:58,588 --> 00:14:00,499
Well, she's very much around.

115
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,192
She's got a lot
more youth about her

116
00:14:02,216 --> 00:14:03,877
than all the young
people you see

117
00:14:04,218 --> 00:14:06,675
in films and
television nowadays.

118
00:14:07,013 --> 00:14:08,013
They're all so callow.

119
00:14:09,057 --> 00:14:10,137
Callow?

120
00:14:10,475 --> 00:14:12,466
Yeah, callow and disgusting.

121
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:15,051
I take it you don't like
the modern generation.

122
00:14:15,396 --> 00:14:16,806
Self-centered animals.

123
00:14:17,148 --> 00:14:19,810
I don't think you
like me in particular.

124
00:14:20,151 --> 00:14:22,563
I'm not the one that
does the hiring and firing.

125
00:14:22,904 --> 00:14:24,394
Well, cheer up, sweetheart.

126
00:14:24,739 --> 00:14:27,025
I may not get the job.

127
00:14:27,367 --> 00:14:30,530
Miss Blair, Mr. Hardy
is here from the registry.

128
00:14:40,046 --> 00:14:41,877
Why don't you sit
down, Mr. Hardy?

129
00:14:42,215 --> 00:14:43,671
I'll be right with you.

130
00:14:44,759 --> 00:14:45,759
She got the name wrong.

131
00:14:45,968 --> 00:14:46,968
It's valance.

132
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:49,085
Miss packard has broken her leg.

133
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:51,887
You'll have to help her
with her wheelchair.

134
00:14:52,225 --> 00:14:53,465
The elevator is out of service,

135
00:14:53,518 --> 00:14:56,260
so she will have to be carried
up and down the stairs.

136
00:14:56,604 --> 00:14:57,263
Do you drink?

137
00:14:57,605 --> 00:14:59,596
Now and then.

138
00:15:01,067 --> 00:15:04,434
Is there a decent interval
between the now and then?

139
00:15:04,779 --> 00:15:07,270
Well, I can steer a straight
line with the wheelchair,

140
00:15:07,615 --> 00:15:08,650
if that's what you mean.

141
00:15:09,826 --> 00:15:12,033
You see, miss packard
is an alcoholic.

142
00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:14,156
We don't allow spirits
on the premises.

143
00:15:15,289 --> 00:15:16,289
No spirits.

144
00:15:19,043 --> 00:15:21,250
Please make yourself
look more presentable.

145
00:15:22,171 --> 00:15:24,287
You'll have to get a haircut

146
00:15:24,632 --> 00:15:25,963
and wear a proper uniform.

147
00:15:27,176 --> 00:15:28,632
You mean I got the job?

148
00:15:31,305 --> 00:15:32,761
Yes.

149
00:15:33,099 --> 00:15:34,910
Yeah, how does anybody
have too much success?

150
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:37,016
I'm unhappy because I
haven't had enough success.

151
00:15:38,646 --> 00:15:41,183
Well, we should all be
grateful for what we have.

152
00:15:42,775 --> 00:15:43,935
Thanks for the advice.

153
00:15:44,277 --> 00:15:46,689
I'll remember it next time
somebody hands me a bedpan.

154
00:15:48,906 --> 00:15:50,646
Hey, um, what's that?

155
00:15:52,493 --> 00:15:53,653
Oh, it's an egg timer.

156
00:15:56,873 --> 00:15:57,873
That's miss packard.

157
00:15:58,082 --> 00:15:59,082
She wants her lunch.

158
00:16:00,209 --> 00:16:00,823
I'll take it.

159
00:16:01,169 --> 00:16:02,169
Oh no, I don't think...

160
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:03,000
1 guess it's about time for her

161
00:16:03,337 --> 00:16:04,356
to meet her babysitter, right?

162
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:05,039
Look, I don't
think miss Blair...

163
00:16:05,381 --> 00:16:06,381
Uh, where do I go?

164
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:10,507
Top of the stairs.

165
00:16:10,845 --> 00:16:11,845
Chop chop!

166
00:16:12,430 --> 00:16:13,430
Take it easy, Greta.

167
00:16:16,184 --> 00:16:19,551
Too bad, sweetheart, the
callow youth got the job.

168
00:16:19,854 --> 00:16:23,767
I did not mean to imply
that you're callow, Mr. Hardy.

169
00:16:24,108 --> 00:16:25,894
I never judge a person
until I know him.

170
00:16:26,235 --> 00:16:27,315
Well, it won't be so bad.

171
00:16:27,653 --> 00:16:29,893
A broken leg is usually only
good for a couple of months.

172
00:16:30,156 --> 00:16:32,693
I'm sure we'll learn
to get along, Mr. Hardy.

173
00:16:33,034 --> 00:16:34,274
You can call me Laurel.

174
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:38,202
Laurel, Laurel n. Hard...

175
00:16:51,302 --> 00:16:52,712
Greta, is that you?

176
00:16:54,722 --> 00:16:55,722
Mildred?

177
00:17:03,856 --> 00:17:05,596
You must be the ice cream man.

178
00:17:05,942 --> 00:17:06,522
That's right.

179
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:07,974
What flavor would you like?

180
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:09,319
Vodka.

181
00:17:09,403 --> 00:17:12,110
Sorry, all we got
is tutti-frutti.

182
00:17:12,448 --> 00:17:15,110
Get out, get out of my bedroom.

183
00:17:15,451 --> 00:17:16,782
You don't like tutti-frutti.

184
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:18,119
I don't like you.

185
00:17:18,204 --> 00:17:20,160
I don't you, and I
don't want to know you.

186
00:17:21,791 --> 00:17:23,873
Mildred, will you
get him outta here?

187
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:27,998
You best leave, Mr.
Whatever your name is.

188
00:17:28,339 --> 00:17:30,330
I'll see what other
flavors I can find, right?

189
00:17:32,343 --> 00:17:35,176
It's Mildred or Greta who
serve meals to miss packard.

190
00:17:37,098 --> 00:17:40,511
If you're incapable of
fitting into our routine,

191
00:17:40,851 --> 00:17:42,637
we'll make other arrangements.

192
00:17:42,979 --> 00:17:44,094
Any questions?

193
00:17:44,438 --> 00:17:47,020
Yeah, can we get
the elevator fixed?

194
00:17:47,358 --> 00:17:50,350
No, the service
charge alone is $50.

195
00:17:53,823 --> 00:17:54,823
Anything else?

196
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:08,355
You could've
told me you were the nurse.

197
00:18:08,379 --> 00:18:10,119
But I had my nursey
costume on, right?

198
00:18:12,383 --> 00:18:13,383
Fuse.

199
00:18:15,136 --> 00:18:17,252
In the mornings, I like
to sit by the pendula.

200
00:18:17,597 --> 00:18:20,464
And in the afternoon, I
like to sit by the pool.

201
00:18:20,808 --> 00:18:23,015
Sometimes, I sneak
in a nap after lunch,

202
00:18:23,352 --> 00:18:25,058
but don't worry, I'll
ring when I want you.

203
00:18:25,396 --> 00:18:26,707
There's a buzzer
in my room, right?

204
00:18:26,731 --> 00:18:29,473
Oh for god's sake, why
do you end every sentence

205
00:18:29,817 --> 00:18:30,817
with a question Mark?

206
00:18:31,068 --> 00:18:32,468
The buzzer's in the
pantry, I think.

207
00:18:32,737 --> 00:18:34,006
You mean, you ring the buzzer,

208
00:18:34,030 --> 00:18:35,215
and you don't know
where it rings?

209
00:18:35,239 --> 00:18:36,729
It's not my concern
where it rings,

210
00:18:37,074 --> 00:18:38,074
as long as it rings.

211
00:18:38,242 --> 00:18:39,698
In other words, I hang around

212
00:18:40,036 --> 00:18:42,618
wherever the buzzer rings
around three, right?

213
00:18:42,955 --> 00:18:45,446
You make it
sound dreadfully difficult.

214
00:18:47,084 --> 00:18:48,915
You know, man,
your house is so big.

215
00:18:49,253 --> 00:18:51,585
Maybe I ought to put a taxi
meter on your wheelchair,

216
00:18:51,922 --> 00:18:53,662
instead of being
paid by the week.

217
00:18:54,008 --> 00:18:55,008
That's up to you.

218
00:18:56,135 --> 00:18:57,135
Where does that go?

219
00:18:58,262 --> 00:18:59,627
Where does that go?

220
00:18:59,972 --> 00:19:03,009
To the heart of this
house, the very heart.

221
00:19:03,351 --> 00:19:05,592
After my husband died, and
I came back from Europe,

222
00:19:05,936 --> 00:19:10,430
I closed those rooms, and
I stopped entertaining.

223
00:19:23,663 --> 00:19:24,663
You know, it's a shame,

224
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:26,703
the state these gardens
have gotten into.

225
00:19:27,041 --> 00:19:29,041
We used to have a wonderful
man who did everything,

226
00:19:29,126 --> 00:19:30,286
and then one day he was gone.

227
00:19:31,796 --> 00:19:34,253
Perhaps you could do
something about the gardens.

228
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:36,376
Do you have a green thumb?

229
00:19:36,717 --> 00:19:39,504
Yeah, I'm pretty good at grass.

230
00:19:44,058 --> 00:19:48,643
You'll have to figure it out.

231
00:19:48,979 --> 00:19:49,979
Oh . - Say!

232
00:19:50,231 --> 00:19:52,222
I remember you from
the silent movies.

233
00:19:52,566 --> 00:19:54,022
You must be fatty arbuckle.

234
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:55,896
On!

235
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:00,605
Oh, wow . - Yeah.

236
00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:02,219
Actually, I picked
up those jokes

237
00:20:02,243 --> 00:20:03,523
from the encyclopedia
britannica.

238
00:22:25,928 --> 00:22:27,634
- Hey, it's dark in here.
- Shh!

239
00:22:27,972 --> 00:22:28,552
Why don't you use the light?

240
00:22:28,889 --> 00:22:29,924
Be quiet.

241
00:22:30,266 --> 00:22:32,097
- Where are we going?
- Shh!

242
00:22:36,647 --> 00:22:40,765
Vic, are you
sure we should go in there?

243
00:22:42,152 --> 00:22:44,768
This goes to the heart of
the house, the very heart.

244
00:22:48,075 --> 00:22:50,195
Hey, what if miss packard
finds out we've been here?

245
00:22:50,369 --> 00:22:52,030
Don't worry about it.

246
00:22:53,789 --> 00:22:55,869
I have never been in this
part of the house before.

247
00:22:55,958 --> 00:22:58,199
And this is where
Katharine packard entertained

248
00:22:58,544 --> 00:23:00,876
in the elegant opulence
of her Hollywood home.

249
00:23:06,343 --> 00:23:07,623
It's only a dummy.

250
00:23:14,351 --> 00:23:16,467
This way to the rathskeller.

251
00:23:16,770 --> 00:23:18,055
Don't be afraid.

252
00:23:20,858 --> 00:23:22,894
And this is where
Katharine packard did some

253
00:23:23,235 --> 00:23:24,725
of her most dedicated drinking.

254
00:23:27,197 --> 00:23:29,188
Hey, Vic, what is a rathskeller?

255
00:23:32,703 --> 00:23:33,703
I give up.

256
00:23:37,249 --> 00:23:38,739
What an interesting room.

257
00:23:39,084 --> 00:23:40,119
Ah, chartreuse.

258
00:23:41,921 --> 00:23:43,001
She got here ahead of us.

259
00:23:44,757 --> 00:23:46,873
Imagine being perched up
here in baronial splendor

260
00:23:47,217 --> 00:23:51,460
on a cloud of gin fizz and
doing exactly as you like.

261
00:23:53,807 --> 00:23:57,095
Most people who do
exactly as they like die.

262
00:23:57,436 --> 00:23:59,156
Aren't you a clever
little fortune cookie.

263
00:24:04,276 --> 00:24:08,019
You know, Vic, I don't
know anything about you,

264
00:24:08,364 --> 00:24:08,898
not really, I mean.

265
00:24:09,239 --> 00:24:10,479
What do you want to know?

266
00:24:12,117 --> 00:24:16,531
Well, tell me about your
past, what you've done,

267
00:24:17,289 --> 00:24:18,369
what you've learned,

268
00:24:18,707 --> 00:24:19,992
what you want to do.

269
00:24:20,334 --> 00:24:22,825
Look, I'm not
interested in the past.

270
00:24:23,754 --> 00:24:25,710
All that counts is now.

271
00:24:27,549 --> 00:24:29,540
But the past is many, many now,

272
00:24:30,761 --> 00:24:33,252
and you're a collection
of all those nows.

273
00:24:33,597 --> 00:24:34,597
All right.

274
00:24:35,265 --> 00:24:37,005
My mother was a lush.

275
00:24:37,351 --> 00:24:38,386
She slept around.

276
00:24:38,727 --> 00:24:41,343
She ran off with a pimp, and
they put me in a foster home.

277
00:24:42,648 --> 00:24:44,229
Is that the kind
of stuff you mean?

278
00:24:46,110 --> 00:24:47,816
That's a beginning.

279
00:24:48,153 --> 00:24:49,153
No.

280
00:24:50,447 --> 00:24:51,687
That's the end.

281
00:25:16,348 --> 00:25:17,884
Turn off the lights, Victor.

282
00:25:22,438 --> 00:25:23,438
Come back.

283
00:25:26,358 --> 00:25:28,690
Now, Victor, lean
back next to me.

284
00:25:32,322 --> 00:25:33,858
Now put your arm around me.

285
00:25:39,955 --> 00:25:42,571
Now say something
just lovely to me.

286
00:25:43,751 --> 00:25:44,751
Like what?

287
00:26:19,745 --> 00:26:22,737
Can't stand that
horrible cacophony.

288
00:26:25,876 --> 00:26:27,867
Miss packard's
looking better today.

289
00:26:29,254 --> 00:26:31,040
Maybe the poor dear's
health is improving.

290
00:26:32,174 --> 00:26:33,174
Katharine.

291
00:26:34,510 --> 00:26:37,001
Would you care to look these
over before I send them out?

292
00:26:37,346 --> 00:26:38,346
He does bring some life

293
00:26:41,183 --> 00:26:43,845
perhaps noise would
be the better word.

294
00:26:44,186 --> 00:26:45,676
Oh, you don't
like music, darling?

295
00:26:46,855 --> 00:26:48,015
I love music.

296
00:26:49,024 --> 00:26:50,560
It's noise that offends me.

297
00:26:52,236 --> 00:26:54,214
What are those
papers you want me to read?

298
00:26:54,238 --> 00:26:56,854
I wish you'd told me you
asked him to clean the pool.

299
00:26:57,199 --> 00:26:59,190
We had quite a scene about it.

300
00:26:59,535 --> 00:27:01,116
You made me look foolish.

301
00:27:01,453 --> 00:27:03,944
Oh, Leslie, let's not
have any difficulties today.

302
00:27:04,289 --> 00:27:05,779
It's such a lovely day.

303
00:27:06,125 --> 00:27:07,990
Here, I'll take care
of that, tomorrow.

304
00:27:08,335 --> 00:27:11,293
Uh, tell me, what was the name

305
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:14,042
of that publicity man,
Jerry or something?

306
00:27:14,383 --> 00:27:14,963
Jerry Flynn.

307
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:17,336
Yes, Jerry Flynn, call him.

308
00:27:17,678 --> 00:27:18,918
Tell him I've been in Europe,

309
00:27:19,263 --> 00:27:21,128
that I want to get
in the columns again

310
00:27:21,473 --> 00:27:23,555
and do a few
personal appearances.

311
00:27:23,892 --> 00:27:24,927
I'll even do television.

312
00:27:25,269 --> 00:27:26,269
He can put me on one

313
00:27:26,353 --> 00:27:28,844
of those vile talent
shows, if he likes.

314
00:27:29,189 --> 00:27:31,350
I'll even do the
Christmas parade.

315
00:27:31,692 --> 00:27:32,772
You don't really mean it.

316
00:27:33,068 --> 00:27:34,899
Of course I mean it.

317
00:27:35,237 --> 00:27:36,852
And have a trunk sent up.

318
00:27:37,197 --> 00:27:38,757
I'm going to get rid
of all my old rags.

319
00:27:39,074 --> 00:27:41,406
I'm going to get a
whole new wardrobe.

320
00:27:41,743 --> 00:27:45,327
Now, Saturday night, we'll
have dinner in the east wing.

321
00:27:45,664 --> 00:27:48,155
Call ira and Josef

322
00:27:49,126 --> 00:27:51,162
and ask Mr. valance to join us.

323
00:27:51,503 --> 00:27:52,788
Mr. valance?

324
00:27:53,130 --> 00:27:54,130
Well, why not?

325
00:27:54,381 --> 00:27:54,961
He's staying here in the house.

326
00:27:55,299 --> 00:27:56,960
It would be rude not to ask him.

327
00:27:57,301 --> 00:27:59,261
Mildred will have a good
deal of cleaning to do.

328
00:27:59,344 --> 00:28:02,677
Oh yes, yes, everything
must be cleaned.

329
00:28:03,015 --> 00:28:06,223
I want it all cleaned, all
the cobwebs brushed away,

330
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:09,677
the silver polished, the
crystal chandelier cleaned

331
00:28:10,022 --> 00:28:11,022
so that it sparkles

332
00:28:12,024 --> 00:28:14,356
we'll but the
candelabra on the table,

333
00:28:14,693 --> 00:28:17,025
and Vic can cut some
flowers from the garden.

334
00:28:20,574 --> 00:28:22,986
Did you know the roses
are all blooming?

335
00:28:25,329 --> 00:28:26,329
They're just beautiful.

336
00:28:29,291 --> 00:28:31,156
J here I go again

337
00:28:31,501 --> 00:28:35,164
j I hear those
trumpets blow again

338
00:28:35,505 --> 00:28:38,838
j all aglow again

339
00:28:39,176 --> 00:28:42,885
j takin' a chance on love

340
00:28:43,222 --> 00:28:46,510
j things are mending now

341
00:28:46,850 --> 00:28:50,593
j I see a rainbow blending now

342
00:28:50,938 --> 00:28:54,305
j we'll have a happy ending now

343
00:28:54,650 --> 00:28:57,016
j takin' a chance on love

344
00:28:57,361 --> 00:28:59,943
you know, your
mother has good taste.

345
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:01,640
But if you don't
get out of here,

346
00:29:01,698 --> 00:29:02,858
I'll have to call the police.

347
00:29:02,908 --> 00:29:04,569
- Oh god!
- You again!

348
00:29:05,702 --> 00:29:06,282
Anybody in there?

349
00:29:06,620 --> 00:29:08,360
Come on in, George is back!

350
00:29:08,705 --> 00:29:10,141
Did you do anything
any good over there?

351
00:29:10,165 --> 00:29:11,267
You touched my masterpiece.

352
00:29:11,291 --> 00:29:11,871
Well, there's a lot...

353
00:29:12,209 --> 00:29:12,789
Uh, what do you call it?

354
00:29:13,126 --> 00:29:14,286
"Gastronomic rhythm."

355
00:29:14,503 --> 00:29:16,272
This sort of work,
George, is unquestionably...

356
00:29:16,296 --> 00:29:18,161
I used to be marvelous.

357
00:29:18,507 --> 00:29:19,872
Right no the nuance.

358
00:29:20,217 --> 00:29:22,208
Now will you get
him out of here!

359
00:29:28,767 --> 00:29:30,007
You, uh, you want a drink?

360
00:29:33,605 --> 00:29:36,221
Makes me sleepy.

361
00:29:36,566 --> 00:29:37,566
Here.

362
00:29:38,068 --> 00:29:39,524
Try one of these.

363
00:29:42,322 --> 00:29:43,322
What is it?

364
00:29:44,324 --> 00:29:46,155
It's a painkiller, man.

365
00:29:47,202 --> 00:29:48,202
A painkiller?

366
00:29:49,204 --> 00:29:51,035
Well, what do I need
a painkiller for?

367
00:29:51,373 --> 00:29:52,658
'Cause you're in pain, man.

368
00:29:57,045 --> 00:29:58,045
You sure?

369
00:30:07,055 --> 00:30:08,716
Come on, Vic, stop it.

370
00:30:09,641 --> 00:30:11,051
No ticky, no washy, huh?

371
00:30:13,603 --> 00:30:15,264
There's a place for everything.

372
00:30:15,605 --> 00:30:17,015
I know where that is.

373
00:30:19,401 --> 00:30:21,232
Oh, Vic, there's
more to life than sex.

374
00:30:21,570 --> 00:30:23,106
- No kidding.
- Hmm.

375
00:31:17,167 --> 00:31:20,079
I was dying of some
mysterious illness,

376
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:23,036
and poor George Brent
didn't know about it.

377
00:31:23,382 --> 00:31:24,667
I guess I missed that one.

378
00:31:25,634 --> 00:31:26,965
Mm, that feels marvelous.

379
00:31:28,595 --> 00:31:30,631
Now remember the
dinner party tonight,

380
00:31:30,972 --> 00:31:33,964
sit up straight and
don't slur your words.

381
00:31:34,309 --> 00:31:38,177
Oh, honestly, your
manners are atrocious.

382
00:31:39,689 --> 00:31:40,974
Victor!

383
00:31:41,316 --> 00:31:42,316
That's too hard.

384
00:31:43,902 --> 00:31:45,517
- Sorry.
- Victor,

385
00:31:45,862 --> 00:31:48,103
that, that hurt awfully.

386
00:31:49,366 --> 00:31:53,200
Sometimes, you forget
how very strong you are.

387
00:31:53,537 --> 00:31:55,368
I didn't realize
I was hurting you.

388
00:32:00,127 --> 00:32:01,127
Kiss me, Victor.

389
00:32:09,636 --> 00:32:12,799
Yes, you do have the eyes

390
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:14,926
of a raven.

391
00:32:15,267 --> 00:32:17,929
Now don't forget,
dinner's at eight,

392
00:32:18,270 --> 00:32:19,680
cocktails, seven, of course.

393
00:32:20,021 --> 00:32:21,557
I'm sure you're gonna like ira.

394
00:32:21,898 --> 00:32:23,183
He's really a darling.

395
00:32:24,860 --> 00:32:27,171
You know, I think he's always
been secretly in love with me,

396
00:32:27,195 --> 00:32:28,935
but he's never done or
said anything to me.

397
00:32:29,281 --> 00:32:30,896
Hollywood was a
glamorous place, then.

398
00:32:31,241 --> 00:32:32,241
It was glamorous.

399
00:32:34,536 --> 00:32:36,197
Now it is just past now.

400
00:32:36,538 --> 00:32:37,573
Yes, bitter.

401
00:32:37,914 --> 00:32:38,994
I am bitter.

402
00:32:39,332 --> 00:32:41,448
I needed time to
direct my pictures.

403
00:32:42,502 --> 00:32:44,959
Creation is like vintage wine.

404
00:32:45,297 --> 00:32:47,629
First, all the
elements must be right,

405
00:32:47,966 --> 00:32:49,547
and then it takes time.

406
00:32:49,885 --> 00:32:51,500
That's why my grapes are sour.

407
00:32:52,762 --> 00:32:55,003
Mr. valance is
interested in acting.

408
00:32:55,348 --> 00:32:57,930
I tried to explain
to him it isn't easy.

409
00:32:58,268 --> 00:32:59,348
But like most young people,

410
00:32:59,436 --> 00:33:01,927
he has an idealistic
point of view.

411
00:33:02,272 --> 00:33:05,389
Well, Hollywood
is no place for an idealist.

412
00:33:05,734 --> 00:33:07,395
Better for a masochist.

413
00:33:07,736 --> 00:33:09,476
Yeah, that's what
they keep telling me,

414
00:33:09,821 --> 00:33:11,277
down at the unemployment office.

415
00:33:12,741 --> 00:33:16,108
Well, it takes dedication
and perseverance.

416
00:33:16,453 --> 00:33:19,240
As in everything, one
must know one's goal

417
00:33:19,581 --> 00:33:21,572
and go after it.

418
00:33:21,917 --> 00:33:26,081
I'm sure Mr. valance knows what
he wants and will persevere.

419
00:33:27,130 --> 00:33:28,495
Isn't that true, Mr. valance?

420
00:33:30,133 --> 00:33:32,340
I'd like to show Mr.
Valance my gallery.

421
00:33:32,677 --> 00:33:35,089
That's where Katharine
keeps her mementos.

422
00:33:35,430 --> 00:33:38,217
I'd love to see those old
things again, Katharine.

423
00:33:38,558 --> 00:33:41,516
But, uh, I'll run
off and fix my face.

424
00:33:41,853 --> 00:33:43,889
Yes, by all means do.

425
00:33:49,444 --> 00:33:51,935
So you're interested
in films, Mr. valance?

426
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:53,280
Oh well, yeah.

427
00:33:53,323 --> 00:33:54,967
I was in an Andy warhol
movie, the other week.

428
00:33:54,991 --> 00:33:55,605
War who?

429
00:33:55,951 --> 00:33:56,951
Hol, warhol.

430
00:33:57,994 --> 00:33:58,994
Oh, interesting.

431
00:33:59,329 --> 00:34:00,444
What part did you play?

432
00:34:00,789 --> 00:34:02,189
Oh, I just sat
there in the movie.

433
00:34:02,332 --> 00:34:03,913
He forgets that she
was a mere puppet,

434
00:34:04,251 --> 00:34:05,832
and I was the master.

435
00:34:06,169 --> 00:34:09,127
What you see is really a
product of my imagination.

436
00:34:09,464 --> 00:34:11,295
Oh please leave
me something, Josef.

437
00:34:11,633 --> 00:34:14,966
After all, it was my legs they
admired, not yours.

438
00:34:15,303 --> 00:34:19,012
Oh, now that's the costume
I wore in "samokhan."

439
00:34:19,349 --> 00:34:22,341
Oh, yeah, that was
with Ronald Fairbanks.

440
00:34:22,686 --> 00:34:23,686
Ronald colman.

441
00:34:25,105 --> 00:34:26,105
Right.

442
00:34:27,357 --> 00:34:29,188
So vivid in my memory,

443
00:34:30,318 --> 00:34:31,979
as if it were yesterday.

444
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:40,160
Thank you.

445
00:34:42,247 --> 00:34:45,865
Oh, Greta, you're
an astute person.

446
00:34:46,209 --> 00:34:47,209
Astute?

447
00:34:49,045 --> 00:34:51,878
If an older woman
showed a great deal

448
00:34:52,215 --> 00:34:56,584
of generosity and
indulgence to a younger man,

449
00:34:58,388 --> 00:35:00,629
wouldn't you think they
were having an affair?

450
00:35:00,974 --> 00:35:02,805
I'm afraid I don't know anything

451
00:35:03,143 --> 00:35:04,143
about that kind...

452
00:35:07,731 --> 00:35:08,731
Excuse me, please.

453
00:35:14,571 --> 00:35:15,771
Why don't you sit down, huh?

454
00:35:16,031 --> 00:35:17,191
I told you I don't want to.

455
00:35:17,365 --> 00:35:18,605
What's the matter with you?

456
00:35:19,868 --> 00:35:21,529
This place gives me the creeps.

457
00:35:23,455 --> 00:35:24,945
What are you talkin' about?

458
00:35:26,166 --> 00:35:27,166
You and Katharine.

459
00:35:29,169 --> 00:35:32,286
Come on, she's old enough
to be my grandmother.

460
00:35:32,631 --> 00:35:35,373
Well, that doesn't seem to
make much difference, does it?

461
00:35:35,717 --> 00:35:38,424
I don't intend on pushin'
the bedpan the rest of my life.

462
00:35:40,388 --> 00:35:43,050
Do it my way, and we'll
have all the bread we want.

463
00:35:43,391 --> 00:35:45,006
I don't want that kind of money.

464
00:35:47,771 --> 00:35:52,014
And I don't my child to
have that kind of a father.

465
00:35:53,109 --> 00:35:54,144
You're pregnant.

466
00:35:57,197 --> 00:35:59,028
You really are a bastard!

467
00:36:01,284 --> 00:36:02,399
Greta, come back here!

468
00:36:03,536 --> 00:36:04,651
Come back!

469
00:36:04,996 --> 00:36:06,406
What do you think
you're doin', huh?

470
00:36:07,666 --> 00:36:09,873
What's the matter with you, huh?

471
00:36:10,210 --> 00:36:11,687
- Let go of me!
- Look, there's nothing

472
00:36:11,711 --> 00:36:12,917
to worry about.

473
00:36:13,254 --> 00:36:14,899
These things can be fixed.
Let go of me, no!

474
00:36:14,923 --> 00:36:16,603
Greta, I meant all
those promises I made.

475
00:36:16,675 --> 00:36:17,881
You're just upset.

476
00:36:18,218 --> 00:36:18,877
Gimme some time and we'll
get outta this dump.

477
00:36:19,219 --> 00:36:20,550
Greta, come back here!

478
00:36:30,146 --> 00:36:31,146
No, no.

479
00:36:38,113 --> 00:36:39,113
Ah!

480
00:36:41,074 --> 00:36:42,359
Greta, what is it?

481
00:36:42,701 --> 00:36:44,862
Miss Blair, I'm
afraid I must go.

482
00:36:45,203 --> 00:36:46,409
Go?

483
00:36:46,746 --> 00:36:48,202
Why?

484
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:51,031
Well, I'd rather not discuss it.

485
00:36:51,376 --> 00:36:53,958
It's just that I can't stay
in this house another day.

486
00:36:54,295 --> 00:36:55,455
It's Mr. valance, isn't it?

487
00:36:58,717 --> 00:37:00,082
Yes.

488
00:37:00,427 --> 00:37:02,543
It hasn't been very
pleasant for any of us.

489
00:37:04,055 --> 00:37:05,295
I'm packing.

490
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:07,631
I'll be leaving in the morning.

491
00:37:07,976 --> 00:37:10,433
Before you go, tomorrow,
won't you come upstairs

492
00:37:10,770 --> 00:37:12,977
with me and tell miss
packard why you're leaving?

493
00:37:13,314 --> 00:37:14,599
- Well, I...
- Please.

494
00:37:14,941 --> 00:37:17,978
It could solve all the
problems in this house.

495
00:37:18,319 --> 00:37:22,187
It's best miss packard know
what kind of man Mr. valance is.

496
00:37:22,532 --> 00:37:23,897
Yes.

497
00:37:24,242 --> 00:37:25,573
Yes, I will.

498
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:27,446
Good.

499
00:38:19,589 --> 00:38:20,589
Vic.

500
00:39:37,959 --> 00:39:38,959
Vic!

501
00:39:51,431 --> 00:39:52,431
Vic.

502
00:40:02,942 --> 00:40:03,942
Vic.

503
00:40:06,446 --> 00:40:07,446
Vic, are you there?

504
00:40:10,283 --> 00:40:11,568
Listen to me, Vic.

505
00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:14,119
I think I understand now.

506
00:40:16,581 --> 00:40:18,663
Vic, you've got to
understand yourself.

507
00:40:20,418 --> 00:40:22,058
Things between you and
miss packard could,

508
00:40:22,378 --> 00:40:23,959
could only go badly, Vic.

509
00:40:25,673 --> 00:40:28,289
She could never give you the
things that you've never had.

510
00:40:32,180 --> 00:40:33,180
Vic?

511
00:40:51,282 --> 00:40:53,273
Vic, I know you're there.

512
00:41:06,798 --> 00:41:07,798
No!

513
00:41:41,082 --> 00:41:42,082
Get out!

514
00:41:46,838 --> 00:41:47,838
Get out.

515
00:42:19,787 --> 00:42:22,870
Well, are you
burying your conscience

516
00:42:24,208 --> 00:42:25,869
or trying to turn
over a new leaf?

517
00:42:27,045 --> 00:42:28,045
Meaning what?

518
00:42:28,796 --> 00:42:30,536
I'm talking about Greta.

519
00:42:30,882 --> 00:42:32,964
It seems that Greta is
leaving us, this morning,

520
00:42:33,301 --> 00:42:34,301
because of you.

521
00:42:35,511 --> 00:42:38,002
Oh, it was, uh, just a few
kisses behind the bushes.

522
00:42:38,347 --> 00:42:39,667
You might not find it so amusing

523
00:42:39,932 --> 00:42:42,014
when she tells miss
packard why she's leaving.

524
00:42:43,603 --> 00:42:45,468
Well, I'm sorry to ruin
your day, miss Blair,

525
00:42:45,813 --> 00:42:46,813
but Greta has left.

526
00:43:38,074 --> 00:43:39,074
Sleep well?

527
00:43:39,283 --> 00:43:40,283
No, horribly.

528
00:43:41,494 --> 00:43:43,075
You didn't ring for breakfast.

529
00:43:43,412 --> 00:43:45,073
I didn't want any.

530
00:43:45,414 --> 00:43:46,028
You know, a little
food might make you feel

531
00:43:46,374 --> 00:43:47,489
a little better, you know.

532
00:43:47,834 --> 00:43:48,914
I feel all right.

533
00:43:50,044 --> 00:43:51,454
You know it's past 10 o'clock?

534
00:43:53,422 --> 00:43:54,878
Where'd that watch come from?

535
00:43:55,216 --> 00:43:57,753
Well, you bought
it for me, Katharine.

536
00:43:58,094 --> 00:43:59,209
I did not.

537
00:43:59,554 --> 00:44:02,887
Look, I told you
I needed a watch.

538
00:44:03,224 --> 00:44:05,886
You said I could charge
one to you at Tiffany's.

539
00:44:06,227 --> 00:44:08,092
What else have you bought?

540
00:44:08,437 --> 00:44:11,224
What else have you
bought and charged to me?

541
00:44:11,566 --> 00:44:13,522
Katharine, you said
I could have a watch.

542
00:44:14,527 --> 00:44:16,142
Where's Leslie?

543
00:44:16,487 --> 00:44:19,229
I never seem to
see Leslie anymore.

544
00:44:19,574 --> 00:44:21,235
Tell her I feel she neglects me.

545
00:44:21,576 --> 00:44:22,986
Of course, darling.

546
00:44:23,327 --> 00:44:25,363
Maybe, uh, you should get
a little fresh air, huh?

547
00:44:25,705 --> 00:44:27,821
We'll go for a drive,
this afternoon.

548
00:44:28,166 --> 00:44:29,622
We could stop... - No.

549
00:44:29,959 --> 00:44:31,319
No, I don't want
to go for a drive.

550
00:44:31,377 --> 00:44:33,208
Oh, listen, we could
go down to Malibu.

551
00:44:34,922 --> 00:44:37,379
And we could stop and have a
little drink on the way home.

552
00:44:37,717 --> 00:44:39,082
How 'bout a little drink?

553
00:44:51,272 --> 00:44:52,603
Go slowly, Vic.

554
00:44:52,940 --> 00:44:54,580
It's so long since
I've been on the strip,

555
00:44:54,609 --> 00:44:55,894
I want to see things.

556
00:44:56,235 --> 00:44:57,645
I guess it's changed.

557
00:44:57,987 --> 00:44:58,987
Oh yes, it has.

558
00:45:00,239 --> 00:45:02,605
It was so glamorous once.

559
00:45:02,950 --> 00:45:06,067
Say, how would you
like to go to a party?

560
00:45:06,412 --> 00:45:07,492
A party, I'd love it.

561
00:45:07,830 --> 00:45:09,366
I haven't been to
a party for ages.

562
00:45:09,707 --> 00:45:11,288
Atwater Kent used

563
00:45:11,626 --> 00:45:14,493
to have such lovely
Sunday afternoon parties,

564
00:45:14,837 --> 00:45:18,421
oh, with the most interesting
people, strolling violins.

565
00:45:39,153 --> 00:45:41,064
Oh such a tacky thing,

566
00:45:42,073 --> 00:45:43,529
tacky New York fairy.

567
00:45:45,201 --> 00:45:47,066
J go back-back, go back-back

568
00:45:47,411 --> 00:45:49,026
j go back

569
00:45:49,372 --> 00:45:51,237
isn't that Katharine packard?

570
00:45:51,582 --> 00:45:53,382
Who's Katharine packard?

571
00:45:53,501 --> 00:45:54,501
Oh, thank you.

572
00:45:54,794 --> 00:45:55,203
Katharine packard, I
have a painting of you.

573
00:45:55,544 --> 00:45:56,829
Thank you very much.

574
00:45:57,171 --> 00:45:58,286
Hey!

575
00:45:58,631 --> 00:46:00,167
I remember you.

576
00:46:00,508 --> 00:46:01,793
You look divine, darling.

577
00:46:02,134 --> 00:46:03,134
Oh.

578
00:46:03,427 --> 00:46:04,787
My son saw you
in the Philippines

579
00:46:05,054 --> 00:46:06,334
when you entertained the troops.

580
00:46:06,389 --> 00:46:08,630
Oh, your son was in
the Spanish-American war?

581
00:46:10,393 --> 00:46:11,393
Want coke, lady?

582
00:46:11,686 --> 00:46:13,677
I'd much prefer a
deep-dish Martini.

583
00:46:14,021 --> 00:46:17,980
No, I got coke, speed,
smack, grass and acid.

584
00:46:18,317 --> 00:46:18,976
No, thank you.

585
00:46:19,318 --> 00:46:20,933
The only trips I
take are to Europe.

586
00:46:21,279 --> 00:46:23,565
I'll get you a vodka
Martini, miss packard.

587
00:46:23,906 --> 00:46:24,906
Thanks.

588
00:46:25,199 --> 00:46:27,531
Wow, I'm Katharine
packard's pusher.

589
00:46:29,161 --> 00:46:30,681
Where'd you find
old Sarah heartburn?

590
00:46:31,455 --> 00:46:32,820
In the classifieds, baby.

591
00:46:34,417 --> 00:46:36,874
Under business opportunities?

592
00:46:37,211 --> 00:46:37,791
Detergent.

593
00:46:38,129 --> 00:46:39,129
Hey, my man!

594
00:46:39,297 --> 00:46:40,878
Where you been
keepin' yourself, huh?

595
00:46:41,215 --> 00:46:44,332
You mean, who has
been keeping yourself?

596
00:46:46,012 --> 00:46:48,219
You know, I'm not in the
habit of crashing parties.

597
00:46:48,556 --> 00:46:49,841
But I must say,

598
00:46:50,182 --> 00:46:53,140
this whole thing is absolutely
fascinating to me.

599
00:46:53,477 --> 00:46:57,140
Oh, here comes my sweet Saint
Bernard with my antifreeze.

600
00:46:58,232 --> 00:46:59,312
Ah.

601
00:46:59,650 --> 00:47:01,686
J come to mama-do

602
00:47:02,028 --> 00:47:03,028
mm.

603
00:47:06,699 --> 00:47:09,611
Yeah!

604
00:47:15,416 --> 00:47:16,416
You're mine now!

605
00:47:32,808 --> 00:47:33,888
Hey, dig this!

606
00:47:34,226 --> 00:47:36,763
Woo! - It will make you crazy!

607
00:47:37,104 --> 00:47:38,104
Woo!

608
00:47:39,648 --> 00:47:40,648
It's heaven.

609
00:47:40,691 --> 00:47:42,056
It's Louis xvi.

610
00:47:42,401 --> 00:47:44,266
Oh, it's Louis v. Bear!

611
00:47:57,917 --> 00:47:59,498
J love by you, by you

612
00:47:59,835 --> 00:48:02,952
j but nobody else but you

613
00:48:03,297 --> 00:48:04,958
I want this one to
go on and on and on

614
00:48:05,299 --> 00:48:07,506
and on and on and on and on!

615
00:48:09,970 --> 00:48:13,133
Oh, look at them,
aren't they wonderful?

616
00:48:14,350 --> 00:48:16,090
- And agreeing with them.
- Take my love.

617
00:48:16,435 --> 00:48:17,435
Take my love.

618
00:48:18,229 --> 00:48:19,890
Take my love. - You are kind.

619
00:48:20,231 --> 00:48:21,437
Take my beard!

620
00:48:22,900 --> 00:48:24,606
You can have my beard.

621
00:48:33,077 --> 00:48:34,533
Oh, look at you!

622
00:48:51,053 --> 00:48:53,089
You look just the
same as you did

623
00:48:53,431 --> 00:48:56,548
in "the bride of Frankenstein."

624
00:48:56,892 --> 00:48:57,892
Thank you.

625
00:48:59,103 --> 00:49:00,103
Vic?

626
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:02,480
Victor!

627
00:49:05,234 --> 00:49:06,234
Where are you?

628
00:50:17,139 --> 00:50:18,139
This is my room.

629
00:50:18,432 --> 00:50:20,013
And you have no
right to be here.

630
00:50:20,351 --> 00:50:21,761
What right do you have

631
00:50:22,102 --> 00:50:24,218
to bring those horrible
people into this house?

632
00:50:25,439 --> 00:50:26,975
They're Katharine's friends.

633
00:50:28,067 --> 00:50:29,067
She invited them.

634
00:50:31,195 --> 00:50:33,937
Mr. valance, you
have taken advantage

635
00:50:34,281 --> 00:50:38,866
of a vulnerable woman, and I
am going to use every means

636
00:50:39,203 --> 00:50:43,037
in my power to see to it
that you leave this house

637
00:50:43,374 --> 00:50:44,374
and never come back.

638
00:50:46,043 --> 00:50:48,955
But, Leslie, she really,
she really needs me now.

639
00:50:50,464 --> 00:50:52,079
She'll never send me away again.

640
00:50:54,718 --> 00:50:56,959
This time, it will be different.

641
00:50:59,181 --> 00:51:00,842
What do you mean?

642
00:51:01,183 --> 00:51:02,468
I always knew she'd need me.

643
00:51:04,728 --> 00:51:05,728
I amuse her.

644
00:51:06,855 --> 00:51:09,187
[, uh, help her
with her wheelchair.

645
00:51:10,109 --> 00:51:13,226
[, uh, serve her her meals.

646
00:51:16,198 --> 00:51:17,688
She'll never listen to you.

647
00:51:18,993 --> 00:51:21,405
I service all her
corpulent needs.

648
00:51:27,209 --> 00:51:28,209
Why, les,

649
00:51:30,337 --> 00:51:32,453
I do believe you're jealous.

650
00:51:50,316 --> 00:51:51,601
Oh, thank you!

651
00:51:55,321 --> 00:51:56,436
Thank you.

652
00:52:14,798 --> 00:52:17,710
Queen, yes, I'm a queen.

653
00:52:18,052 --> 00:52:20,008
I'm the queen of the may.

654
00:52:20,346 --> 00:52:24,931
No, I'm the queen of the
Christmas parade.

655
00:52:29,355 --> 00:52:31,596
Merry Christmas, everyone,

656
00:52:31,940 --> 00:52:36,058
and all is well, well,
well, well.

657
00:52:36,403 --> 00:52:39,270
Merry Christmas and
a happy new year!

658
00:52:40,699 --> 00:52:41,939
Yo, ho, ho, ho!

659
00:53:00,928 --> 00:53:02,134
Yo, ho, ho, ho!

660
00:53:04,598 --> 00:53:05,598
See, he heard that.

661
00:53:05,933 --> 00:53:07,343
Happy new year!

662
00:53:07,685 --> 00:53:09,537
Now ladies and
gentlemen, boys and girls,

663
00:53:09,561 --> 00:53:11,643
here's that moment we've
all been waiting for.

664
00:53:11,980 --> 00:53:12,980
Here he is, all the way

665
00:53:13,232 --> 00:53:14,938
from the north pole,
it's Santa claus

666
00:53:15,275 --> 00:53:18,017
and the queen of the
Santa clause Lane parade.

667
00:53:19,154 --> 00:53:20,434
Ah, I wonder who the queen is.

668
00:53:20,614 --> 00:53:21,899
The one with the beard, silly.

669
00:53:32,668 --> 00:53:34,437
And here, ladies and
gentlemen, a face familiar

670
00:53:34,461 --> 00:53:36,918
to Hollywood, the queen of
the Santa clause Lane parade,

671
00:53:37,256 --> 00:53:38,917
miss Katharine packard.

672
00:53:39,258 --> 00:53:40,258
Yes.

673
00:53:43,178 --> 00:53:48,093
Uh, well, it's so wonderful.

674
00:53:49,268 --> 00:53:51,975
It's, it's simply wonderful,

675
00:53:52,312 --> 00:53:54,598
all, all these wonderful people.

676
00:53:57,526 --> 00:54:00,393
1, 1, I'm sure this is
reminiscent of other evenings

677
00:54:00,738 --> 00:54:02,103
for you on Hollywood boulevard.

678
00:54:02,448 --> 00:54:04,860
Yes, I've had
glorious nights here.

679
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:08,033
Sid grauman, poor old sid,

680
00:54:09,079 --> 00:54:11,070
he was a good friend
of mine, you know.

681
00:54:12,624 --> 00:54:16,333
We always had our premiere's
at grauman's Chinese.

682
00:54:16,670 --> 00:54:19,286
But the boulevard has
changed since then,

683
00:54:19,631 --> 00:54:23,965
all these hoodlums
and queers, oh!

684
00:54:25,888 --> 00:54:29,005
The boulevard has gone downhill.

685
00:54:29,349 --> 00:54:30,589
It's gone downhill!

686
00:54:31,977 --> 00:54:33,204
- Boo!
- I'm tellin' you the truth.

687
00:54:33,228 --> 00:54:35,765
Thank you, thank you,
yes, uh, uh, and there,

688
00:54:36,106 --> 00:54:36,686
ladies and gentlemen,

689
00:54:37,024 --> 00:54:38,389
you have miss Katharine packard,

690
00:54:38,734 --> 00:54:41,271
a great actress, a great star.

691
00:54:42,196 --> 00:54:45,108
Katharine, Jerry Flynn called.

692
00:54:45,449 --> 00:54:46,529
Do you want to talk to him?

693
00:54:46,742 --> 00:54:49,984
No, how did you
like my performance,

694
00:54:50,329 --> 00:54:51,944
last night, on television?

695
00:54:52,289 --> 00:54:53,729
It was obvious
that you were drunk.

696
00:54:53,916 --> 00:54:54,916
Leslie!

697
00:54:55,793 --> 00:54:57,829
I'm not one to lie
to you, Katharine.

698
00:54:58,170 --> 00:55:01,003
Well, at least I didn't
fall off the float.

699
00:55:01,340 --> 00:55:03,626
Now please go, I don't
want to see you or anyone.

700
00:55:06,970 --> 00:55:08,801
You've been a great
star, Katharine.

701
00:55:11,099 --> 00:55:12,464
You're an exceptional
human being.

702
00:55:13,852 --> 00:55:15,262
But now don't destroy the past

703
00:55:15,604 --> 00:55:18,095
by making a fool of yourself
over that Mr. valance.

704
00:55:19,775 --> 00:55:24,109
Let's face him for what he
is, a vulgar opportunist.

705
00:55:26,198 --> 00:55:29,065
Please, please, Leslie,

706
00:55:29,409 --> 00:55:32,367
just leave me alone.

707
00:55:32,704 --> 00:55:33,704
Will you?

708
00:55:47,302 --> 00:55:50,635
I'll thank you to wipe
your feet before coming in.

709
00:55:50,973 --> 00:55:52,088
You're welcome, Mildred.

710
00:55:52,432 --> 00:55:55,890
And it's miss Leslie
that goes through the mail.

711
00:55:56,228 --> 00:55:57,343
Things change.

712
00:55:57,646 --> 00:55:59,432
They certainly do, Mr. valance.

713
00:55:59,773 --> 00:56:01,980
I hope you haven't been
disturbing Katharine.

714
00:56:02,317 --> 00:56:03,317
She's feeling ill.

715
00:56:03,360 --> 00:56:04,691
Yes, quite ill.

716
00:56:06,572 --> 00:56:08,733
Oh, miss Leslie, there's
been so many problems

717
00:56:09,074 --> 00:56:10,985
since that young man arrived.

718
00:56:11,326 --> 00:56:12,691
Don't worry, Mildred.

719
00:56:13,036 --> 00:56:14,321
I think our problems are solved.

720
00:56:21,712 --> 00:56:23,122
Why, Victor,
where have you been?

721
00:56:24,172 --> 00:56:25,503
I've been waiting for you.

722
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:27,880
1, uh...

723
00:56:28,218 --> 00:56:29,658
Come over here
and sit close to me.

724
00:56:35,058 --> 00:56:39,973
You know, all afternoon, I've
been thinking and planning.

725
00:56:40,898 --> 00:56:42,041
We'll go away, soon, won't we?

726
00:56:42,065 --> 00:56:43,976
Oh yeah, sure, we'll go away.

727
00:56:44,318 --> 00:56:45,318
Well, I was thinking,

728
00:56:45,360 --> 00:56:46,640
you'll need some summer clothes.

729
00:56:46,820 --> 00:56:48,230
Yeah, yes, I will.

730
00:56:48,572 --> 00:56:49,572
And a car.

731
00:56:50,324 --> 00:56:51,324
Car?

732
00:56:51,575 --> 00:56:53,486
Well, we can't take the rolls.

733
00:56:53,827 --> 00:56:56,785
You'll need a smaller car,
something you can run about in.

734
00:56:57,122 --> 00:56:58,612
You mean something
like a Maserati?

735
00:56:58,957 --> 00:57:00,948
Yes, something like that.

736
00:57:03,003 --> 00:57:04,003
Oh.

737
00:57:06,173 --> 00:57:07,879
Do you know, Victor,

738
00:57:08,216 --> 00:57:10,127
that's the first time
you've ever kissed me

739
00:57:10,469 --> 00:57:11,504
without my asking you to?

740
00:57:12,888 --> 00:57:16,051
Was it the Maserati
or the clothes?

741
00:57:16,391 --> 00:57:17,391
What do you mean?

742
00:57:18,435 --> 00:57:22,895
I must've been a very
lonely, miserable woman not

743
00:57:23,231 --> 00:57:26,394
to have imagined what
an opportunist you are.

744
00:57:27,986 --> 00:57:30,398
I must've been very lonely.

745
00:57:32,532 --> 00:57:37,026
Now, for god's sake, please
just get out of my house.

746
00:57:37,371 --> 00:57:40,113
What's the matter with you?

747
00:57:40,457 --> 00:57:41,457
Get out!

748
00:57:49,091 --> 00:57:50,831
Get out of my house!

749
00:58:03,105 --> 00:58:04,105
Oh god.

750
00:58:39,307 --> 00:58:40,627
You're not to disturb Katharine.

751
00:58:40,851 --> 00:58:43,012
I don't intend to disturb her.

752
00:58:43,353 --> 00:58:45,435
She's sleeping, and
you're not to come up here.

753
00:58:45,772 --> 00:58:48,559
Oh, well, I'll
come back later then.

754
00:59:24,728 --> 00:59:25,728
Ah!

755
00:59:40,660 --> 00:59:41,660
No.

756
00:59:43,246 --> 00:59:44,246
Leslie!

757
00:59:45,123 --> 00:59:47,489
Leslie!

758
00:59:48,794 --> 00:59:49,794
Les!

759
01:00:05,769 --> 01:00:06,769
Victor.

760
01:00:07,604 --> 01:00:08,604
Victor.

761
01:00:10,524 --> 01:00:11,889
Victor, where are you?

762
01:00:14,277 --> 01:00:15,277
Vic!

763
01:00:16,154 --> 01:00:18,110
Vic, I know you're here.

764
01:00:34,131 --> 01:00:37,874
Operator, operator,
operator, I need help.

765
01:00:38,218 --> 01:00:39,218
I need...

766
01:00:45,809 --> 01:00:49,518
Oh somebody, somebody
help me, help me, help me.

767
01:00:51,565 --> 01:00:53,931
Oh god, oh dear god, help me!

768
01:00:55,235 --> 01:00:57,317
Help me, help, help, help!

769
01:01:05,078 --> 01:01:07,535
Ah!

770
01:01:46,953 --> 01:01:47,953
Miss Blair.

771
01:01:49,039 --> 01:01:50,950
Yes, Mr. valance?

772
01:01:51,291 --> 01:01:53,031
I suppose you want
your paycheck.

773
01:01:53,376 --> 01:01:55,037
I haven't made it out yet.

774
01:01:55,378 --> 01:01:57,869
I seem to forget that
you're an employee here.

775
01:01:58,215 --> 01:02:00,046
Katharine doesn't
want to be disturbed.

776
01:02:01,343 --> 01:02:03,675
She suggests that you
take the afternoon off.

777
01:02:04,012 --> 01:02:05,012
Katharine doesn't know

778
01:02:05,305 --> 01:02:07,265
that I have some bookkeeping
to do this afternoon,

779
01:02:08,433 --> 01:02:10,139
which I'm sure she
will find of interest.

780
01:02:22,197 --> 01:02:24,438
Oh, Vic, how nice.

781
01:02:25,784 --> 01:02:28,196
Well, what time is it?

782
01:02:30,247 --> 01:02:32,863
You know, I think I'm hungry.

783
01:02:33,208 --> 01:02:35,039
Has, has Greta fixed dinner?

784
01:02:35,377 --> 01:02:36,377
Greta's gone.

785
01:02:37,420 --> 01:02:38,535
Gone?

786
01:02:38,880 --> 01:02:39,880
You made her go.

787
01:02:41,591 --> 01:02:43,422
No, no, I didn't.

788
01:02:45,178 --> 01:02:46,634
Where's Leslie?

789
01:02:46,972 --> 01:02:48,587
I want to see Leslie.

790
01:02:50,684 --> 01:02:51,844
She's not here.

791
01:02:56,231 --> 01:03:00,019
Vic, I'm, I'm frightened.

792
01:03:00,360 --> 01:03:01,360
I'm frightened!

793
01:03:02,070 --> 01:03:03,150
Your nerves are bad.

794
01:03:05,448 --> 01:03:07,063
Maybe a little drink
will help, uh...

795
01:03:07,409 --> 01:03:08,409
No!

796
01:03:08,535 --> 01:03:09,945
No, I, I, I don't.

797
01:03:11,997 --> 01:03:12,997
Drink!

798
01:03:16,626 --> 01:03:18,082
Listen, my mother was a lush.

799
01:03:20,171 --> 01:03:21,211
She couldn't help herself.

800
01:03:25,552 --> 01:03:26,883
No, I don't, I don't want...

801
01:03:27,220 --> 01:03:28,220
Drink!

802
01:03:30,140 --> 01:03:33,473
And we'll, uh, we'll
make a little toast, hmm?

803
01:03:37,230 --> 01:03:39,972
Here's to lonely,
rich, old bags.

804
01:03:47,365 --> 01:03:50,823
= take it, please, take it.

805
01:03:51,161 --> 01:03:55,951
Now, uh, why don't you sing
me your little song, huh?

806
01:03:56,958 --> 01:03:57,958
I can't.

807
01:03:58,293 --> 01:03:58,907
I couldn't.

808
01:03:59,252 --> 01:04:00,287
I can't... - Sing!

809
01:04:02,505 --> 01:04:05,668
J here I go again

810
01:04:06,009 --> 01:04:09,172
j those rainbows blow again

811
01:04:09,512 --> 01:04:11,377
oh, no, no, no, that isn't it.

812
01:04:11,723 --> 01:04:12,723
That's wrong.

813
01:04:12,807 --> 01:04:15,139
[, I can't, I can't remember it.

814
01:04:16,728 --> 01:04:18,935
Maybe a little drink will
help you remember, huh?

815
01:04:26,196 --> 01:04:27,231
Now sing.

816
01:04:31,201 --> 01:04:33,817
J here I go again

817
01:04:34,162 --> 01:04:36,744
j here I go again

818
01:04:37,832 --> 01:04:38,947
louder, louder.

819
01:04:40,502 --> 01:04:44,495
J I hear those
trumpets blow again

820
01:04:44,839 --> 01:04:45,954

821
01:04:46,299 --> 01:04:50,417

01:04:50,762 --> 01:04:54,471

01:04:54,808 --> 01:04:58,676

j all aglow again

826
01:05:10,073 --> 01:05:13,782
j all aglow again, aglow again

827
01:05:23,878 --> 01:05:25,743
Don't be stingy, Mildred.

828
01:05:31,177 --> 01:05:32,177
Thank you, love.

829
01:05:36,558 --> 01:05:41,097
His royal highness is
having Brandy and cigars.

830
01:05:41,438 --> 01:05:43,349
Mildred, where's the egg timer?

831
01:05:43,690 --> 01:05:45,021
Humpty dumpty?

832
01:05:45,358 --> 01:05:48,441
It disappeared mysteriously
along with Greta.

833
01:05:49,571 --> 01:05:50,571
What do you mean?

834
01:05:50,613 --> 01:05:52,103
I can't find it anywhere.

835
01:05:53,074 --> 01:05:54,314
I mean about Greta.

836
01:05:55,452 --> 01:05:57,784
You said mysteriously
disappeared.

837
01:05:58,121 --> 01:06:00,237
Oh, that's what
she did, didn't she?

838
01:07:37,303 --> 01:07:41,296
Mildred, I notice you haven't
been polishing the silver.

839
01:07:41,641 --> 01:07:43,427
Tarnished silverware
is so depressing.

840
01:07:44,936 --> 01:07:46,927
This is a big
house, Mr. valance.

841
01:07:47,272 --> 01:07:48,978
There's too much to do
for one housekeeper.

842
01:07:49,315 --> 01:07:50,350
Yes, I understand.

843
01:07:50,692 --> 01:07:52,978
It must be quite difficult
for a woman of your age.

844
01:07:53,319 --> 01:07:56,356
Perhaps a younger woman
could handle it better.

845
01:07:57,782 --> 01:08:00,489
Oh Mildred, would you
tell Leslie I want

846
01:08:00,827 --> 01:08:02,692
to speak to her
about the screening?

847
01:08:09,085 --> 01:08:12,748
But I do wish
you'd come by, ira.

848
01:08:13,089 --> 01:08:14,750
She doesn't seem to
listen to me anymore.

849
01:08:15,091 --> 01:08:18,299
Oh, I don't think things
can be as bad as all that.

850
01:08:18,636 --> 01:08:19,636
Hold on a minute.

851
01:08:21,055 --> 01:08:24,047
Leslie thinks it's important
that I talk to Katharine.

852
01:08:24,392 --> 01:08:26,592
Apparently, there's some
difficulty with that young man.

853
01:08:26,894 --> 01:08:28,134
If you think I'm gonna let

854
01:08:28,479 --> 01:08:30,970
that woman ruin our holiday
again, you're mistaken.

855
01:08:33,484 --> 01:08:36,351
Leslie, we're going out
of town tomorrow, but I'll,

856
01:08:36,696 --> 01:08:38,436
I'll drop by at the
end of next week.

857
01:08:40,366 --> 01:08:42,823
Yes, ira, good night.

858
01:08:47,290 --> 01:08:50,407
Vic, yes, you had
nothing, remember?

859
01:08:50,752 --> 01:08:54,961
You came here, and you had
nothing, and I helped you.

860
01:08:56,966 --> 01:09:00,458
And I loved you, a little,

861
01:09:00,803 --> 01:09:01,803
I think.

862
01:09:39,425 --> 01:09:41,105
I have to watch you
like a hawk, don't I?

863
01:09:41,302 --> 01:09:42,302
No, no, no.

864
01:09:42,512 --> 01:09:44,503
Did you think I was
somebody you could buy

865
01:09:44,847 --> 01:09:46,712
with your little handouts?

866
01:09:47,058 --> 01:09:48,058
Was I to be another one

867
01:09:48,351 --> 01:09:49,871
of those mo-mentos
for your collection?

868
01:09:50,186 --> 01:09:51,676
- No.
- You'd like me stuffed

869
01:09:52,021 --> 01:09:53,981
and put in a glass case
for all your dinner guests

870
01:09:54,315 --> 01:09:55,315
to admire, wouldn't you?

871
01:09:55,650 --> 01:09:58,608
No, no, Victor, why
are you doing this to me?

872
01:09:58,945 --> 01:10:00,297
You were gonna throw me out.

873
01:10:00,321 --> 01:10:02,186
No, listen, listen to me.

874
01:10:02,532 --> 01:10:05,490
Victor, Victor, listen to me.

875
01:10:05,827 --> 01:10:07,613
I'll give you anything you want.

876
01:10:07,954 --> 01:10:10,320
My money, I've lots
and lots of money,

877
01:10:10,665 --> 01:10:12,906
and my jewelry, all my jewelry.

878
01:10:13,251 --> 01:10:15,913
On, I'll, I'l, I'l, I'm
give you everything I've got.

879
01:10:16,254 --> 01:10:17,254
Too late for that!

880
01:10:19,173 --> 01:10:20,213
You're going to hurt me.

881
01:10:20,258 --> 01:10:21,668
Oh no, Victor, please.

882
01:10:22,009 --> 01:10:24,295
Oh no, please, don't hurt me.

883
01:10:24,637 --> 01:10:26,047
No, please don't hurt me!

884
01:10:26,389 --> 01:10:27,879
Victor, don't kill
me, don't kill me.

885
01:10:28,224 --> 01:10:29,885
Victor, don't kill me.

886
01:10:30,226 --> 01:10:31,932
Victor, please, don't kill me!

887
01:10:32,270 --> 01:10:34,306
Oh, I don't want to die!

888
01:10:34,647 --> 01:10:36,683
I don't want to diel

889
01:11:36,459 --> 01:11:37,459
Katharine.

890
01:11:41,547 --> 01:11:42,547
Katharine.

891
01:11:54,560 --> 01:11:57,893
Why, Mr. valance,
are you leaving?

892
01:11:58,231 --> 01:11:59,631
Miss packard
wanted me to put some

893
01:11:59,774 --> 01:12:00,934
of her stuff in the basement.

894
01:12:01,275 --> 01:12:03,266
See that you don't
Mark the floors.

895
01:12:03,611 --> 01:12:05,772
Miss packard would
like her breakfast.

896
01:12:06,113 --> 01:12:08,149
She's feeling
better, this morning.

897
01:13:01,335 --> 01:13:05,078
Oh, Mr. valance,
you frightened me.

898
01:13:05,423 --> 01:13:06,788
Your nerves are bad, miss Blair.

899
01:13:11,053 --> 01:13:12,133
You look pale.

900
01:13:12,471 --> 01:13:14,553
My nerves are quite
good, thank you.

901
01:13:15,683 --> 01:13:16,963
Tell Mildred that miss packard

902
01:13:17,268 --> 01:13:19,680
will have her eggs soft
boiled, this morning.

903
01:13:20,021 --> 01:13:21,852
And I'll have my
breakfast in the sunroom.

904
01:13:22,189 --> 01:13:24,601
Yes.

905
01:13:28,946 --> 01:13:30,356
I'll take it up when it's ready.

906
01:13:39,749 --> 01:13:42,866
Apparently, the poor
dear's feeling better.

907
01:13:43,210 --> 01:13:44,210
Yes.

908
01:13:45,254 --> 01:13:47,870
The other night, I
thought I heard her scream.

909
01:13:49,008 --> 01:13:50,248
Scream?

910
01:13:50,593 --> 01:13:52,254
Yes, I was asleep,
and it woke me.

911
01:13:53,763 --> 01:13:55,879
Perhaps I was
having a nightmare.

912
01:13:56,223 --> 01:13:57,884
Haven't been sleeping well.

913
01:13:58,225 --> 01:14:02,013
This house just isn't the same.

914
01:14:03,105 --> 01:14:04,936
Mr. jaffee will be back soon.

915
01:14:06,567 --> 01:14:08,353
Perhaps he'll be
able to do something.

916
01:14:09,695 --> 01:14:12,732
You know, I think
she's drinking again.

917
01:14:14,700 --> 01:14:16,531
Why, what makes you think that?

918
01:14:16,869 --> 01:14:19,702
She stays up in her room
there now all the time.

919
01:14:20,039 --> 01:14:21,039
Yes.

920
01:14:22,333 --> 01:14:23,573
Yes, perhaps you're right.

921
01:14:37,348 --> 01:14:39,930
Well, I see miss packard
didn't want cream after all.

922
01:14:40,267 --> 01:14:40,881
What do you mean?

923
01:14:41,227 --> 01:14:42,512
I forgot to give her cream.

924
01:14:42,853 --> 01:14:44,468
I thought you'd be down for it.

925
01:14:44,814 --> 01:14:46,454
As a matter of fact,
I drank the coffee.

926
01:14:48,275 --> 01:14:49,275
She didn't want any.

927
01:15:07,128 --> 01:15:10,370
You know, I shouldn't
have to ask for my check.

928
01:15:10,715 --> 01:15:12,956
Perhaps you'd like
me to mail it to you.

929
01:15:13,300 --> 01:15:14,695
You can put it
under my bedroom door.

930
01:15:14,719 --> 01:15:15,719
That'll be fine.

931
01:15:16,846 --> 01:15:18,882
Which bedroom door?

932
01:15:20,057 --> 01:15:22,719
Oh, just a moment, Mr. valance.

933
01:15:23,060 --> 01:15:25,642
Would you have miss packard
approve and sign these papers?

934
01:15:25,980 --> 01:15:27,971
I would like them
returned in the morning.

935
01:15:28,315 --> 01:15:30,852
They happen to be
your charge accounts.

936
01:15:31,193 --> 01:15:34,856
I don't think I could send out
checks in such large amounts

937
01:15:35,197 --> 01:15:37,108
without miss packard's approval.

938
01:19:46,407 --> 01:19:49,695
Katharine, don't be
alarmed, it's me.

939
01:19:50,953 --> 01:19:52,113
We must be very quiet.

940
01:19:53,163 --> 01:19:55,199
Oh, thank god you're all right.

941
01:19:56,166 --> 01:19:57,952
I've been so worried.

942
01:19:58,294 --> 01:20:00,080
He wouldn't let
me come upstairs.

943
01:20:01,088 --> 01:20:02,828
We've got to get out
of this house, tonight.

944
01:20:03,173 --> 01:20:04,413
That man is dangerous.

945
01:20:04,758 --> 01:20:06,464
I'm awfully frightened.

946
01:20:07,594 --> 01:20:09,050
Oh, oh no!

947
01:20:09,388 --> 01:20:10,753
No, oh no, no, no!

948
01:20:12,016 --> 01:20:13,131
Oh no, no, no!

949
01:20:14,226 --> 01:20:16,763
No!

950
01:20:32,453 --> 01:20:33,568
Miss Leslie!

951
01:20:39,918 --> 01:20:40,918
Miss Leslie!

952
01:20:48,052 --> 01:20:49,883
Leslie thought you
were in the trunk.

953
01:20:51,972 --> 01:20:55,180
She didn't know you were in
the flowerbed with Greta.

954
01:20:55,517 --> 01:20:56,723
But you told her, didn't ya?

955
01:21:01,190 --> 01:21:02,190
Didn't you?

956
01:21:17,206 --> 01:21:18,683
You know what happened
the last time you talked

957
01:21:18,707 --> 01:21:20,163
to Leslie about me.

958
01:21:40,813 --> 01:21:41,928
Are you awake?

959
01:21:43,482 --> 01:21:44,482
Are you awake?

960
01:21:48,070 --> 01:21:50,311
I love you.

961
01:21:50,656 --> 01:21:52,146
I know you love me.

962
01:21:52,491 --> 01:21:55,574
That's why I came back
after all those years.

963
01:21:56,537 --> 01:21:59,825
I knew you'd need me, one day.

964
01:22:01,333 --> 01:22:02,994
I feel I can trust
you now, can't I?

965
01:22:18,976 --> 01:22:20,341
Get out, get out!

966
01:22:38,078 --> 01:22:39,739
You know, what you
need is some air.

967
01:22:44,084 --> 01:22:45,084
Just ring if you need me.

968
01:23:10,152 --> 01:23:12,643
Good morning, Mildred.

969
01:23:12,988 --> 01:23:15,104
She's not feeling
well, this morning.

970
01:23:15,449 --> 01:23:16,905
An omelet and some orange juice.

971
01:23:17,242 --> 01:23:18,242
Yes, sir.

972
01:23:19,661 --> 01:23:21,071
I'll take it up when it's ready.

973
01:23:32,424 --> 01:23:34,255
Mildred, are you ill?

974
01:23:36,386 --> 01:23:37,386
=?

975
01:23:37,471 --> 01:23:39,678
Of course I'm not ill.

976
01:23:40,015 --> 01:23:41,971
I've never been sick
a day in my life.

977
01:23:42,309 --> 01:23:44,891
I'll thank you not
to imply I'm ill.

978
01:23:46,230 --> 01:23:49,518
You know, uh, I think you
could do with a holiday.

979
01:23:49,858 --> 01:23:51,849
Why don't you, uh,
take some time off?

980
01:23:52,194 --> 01:23:55,106
Why, I don't know
what I'd do with myself.

981
01:24:04,289 --> 01:24:07,156
Mildred, when Leslie
returns from town,

982
01:24:09,670 --> 01:24:11,786
tell her I want to see her.

983
01:24:47,249 --> 01:24:48,955
Miss Leslie?

984
01:24:49,293 --> 01:24:52,626
I was just another
one of your crusades.

985
01:24:52,963 --> 01:24:56,046
You have people up that think
anything great about you.

986
01:24:56,383 --> 01:24:57,903
You know, it's true
you never loved me.

987
01:24:58,135 --> 01:24:59,135
You know what?

988
01:24:59,386 --> 01:25:00,905
I think you thought
you had me fooled, huh,

989
01:25:00,929 --> 01:25:03,011
you and your righteous friends?

990
01:25:03,348 --> 01:25:05,708
And how do you think I'm suffering
about this, all the time,

991
01:25:05,809 --> 01:25:09,472
cozying up with your
stupid friends, huh?

992
01:25:12,482 --> 01:25:14,097
I know better now.

993
01:25:14,443 --> 01:25:17,776
The truth is you only had
time for those drunk friends

994
01:25:18,113 --> 01:25:19,353
of yours you slept around with.

995
01:25:20,699 --> 01:25:22,064
You never really wanted me,

996
01:25:22,409 --> 01:25:24,650
and so you thought you
could order me around.

997
01:25:24,995 --> 01:25:27,236
You, oh yeah, tell
me how to behave,

998
01:25:27,581 --> 01:25:28,661
tell me how to dress,

999
01:25:30,292 --> 01:25:31,702
tell me about my manners,

1000
01:25:32,878 --> 01:25:34,414
tell me about how to speak, huh?

1001
01:25:35,881 --> 01:25:37,963
You thought you could
tell me what to do.

1002
01:25:38,300 --> 01:25:40,336
And then you thought you
could throw me out, huh!

1003
01:25:54,566 --> 01:25:55,681
Mr. valance!

1004
01:26:05,369 --> 01:26:06,369
Mr. valance!

1005
01:26:53,959 --> 01:26:55,039
Good evening, miss packard.

1006
01:26:56,294 --> 01:26:57,704
I brought your tray.

1007
01:26:59,005 --> 01:27:00,870
I think it'd be nice if
you had it over here,

1008
01:27:01,216 --> 01:27:02,376
at the fireplace.

1009
01:27:02,718 --> 01:27:04,379
And [I'll light the fire.

1010
01:27:04,720 --> 01:27:05,905
My goodness,

1011
01:27:05,929 --> 01:27:07,089
listen to that rain.

1012
01:27:08,473 --> 01:27:09,804
You'll catch your death.

1013
01:27:10,142 --> 01:27:11,369
You should have
something around you.

1014
01:27:11,393 --> 01:27:12,393
I'll get your shawl.

1015
01:29:26,194 --> 01:29:30,733
Folks, this is the home
of Katharine packard,

1016
01:29:31,074 --> 01:29:34,066
one of the most famous stars
of the motion picture screen.

1017
01:29:34,411 --> 01:29:37,903
Happily retired from the glamor
of the motion picture world,

1018
01:29:38,248 --> 01:29:39,909
she now devotes
her days of leisure

1019
01:29:40,250 --> 01:29:41,786
to benevolent social work

1020
01:29:42,127 --> 01:29:44,163
and her pet Hollywood charities.

1021
01:29:44,504 --> 01:29:46,119
This home was built at a cost...
