1
00:00:39,872 --> 00:00:42,209
Terrible fog.

2
00:00:42,292 --> 00:00:45,341
This isn't Black Rock.

3
00:00:49,301 --> 00:00:52,398
We must have missed the crossroad.

4
00:00:52,471 --> 00:00:53,943
Back to the cans.

5
00:00:54,015 --> 00:00:56,103
We'll go on.

6
00:01:07,949 --> 00:01:09,622
Go.

7
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:47,334
Why did we cut through the woods?
Whoever crosses those evil roots

8
00:01:47,416 --> 00:01:50,465
Keep the drivers fed and shut up.

9
00:03:06,057 --> 00:03:10,068
THE VIRGIN AND THE MONSTER

10
00:07:56,006 --> 00:07:59,555
A double wedding,
what a treat for our town.

11
00:07:59,678 --> 00:08:03,641
Just pin the skirt together,
we'll wait for the jewels.

12
00:08:11,150 --> 00:08:13,370
Here the emeralds.

13
00:08:13,737 --> 00:08:16,585
You look wonderful, sisters.

14
00:08:16,657 --> 00:08:18,829
You turn next.

15
00:08:19,494 --> 00:08:23,458
When you come to buy saffron,
my husband will let you have it cheap.

16
00:08:23,541 --> 00:08:25,926
Mine will sell you his pearls
and diamonds.

17
00:08:26,169 --> 00:08:28,555
Not cheap, but they will be beautiful.

18
00:08:28,714 --> 00:08:30,518
I hope you catch at least a Duke.

19
00:08:30,592 --> 00:08:32,597
Not merchants, like we did.

20
00:08:32,678 --> 00:08:35,478
A palace, a coat of arms

21
00:08:35,598 --> 00:08:39,609
Lots of gold, shiny coins.

22
00:08:39,853 --> 00:08:41,941
I'm not getting married.

23
00:08:42,023 --> 00:08:43,494
Father would be alone.

24
00:08:43,566 --> 00:08:45,204
Father will find himself a wife.

25
00:08:45,277 --> 00:08:46,950
He's done it before.

26
00:08:47,029 --> 00:08:49,664
Or you wouldn't be here.

27
00:09:08,264 --> 00:09:12,145
Beautiful old wine.

28
00:09:13,438 --> 00:09:15,775
Such a spicy tang.

29
00:09:16,274 --> 00:09:19,538
Perhaps it is too good for the wedding
quests?

30
00:09:20,196 --> 00:09:22,451
It is beautifully golden.

31
00:09:24,243 --> 00:09:28,124
I have ordered several barrels of
red Amontillado from Morocco.

32
00:09:28,174 --> 00:09:30,659
But your goods should have been here
yesterday afternoon.

33
00:09:30,709 --> 00:09:32,181
The distance is great.

34
00:09:32,253 --> 00:09:36,015
But with that day of delay
I have already lost fifty florins.

35
00:09:36,091 --> 00:09:39,271
I had to get into debt myself
in order to loan you money.

36
00:09:39,345 --> 00:09:41,896
And thirty thousand,
that's a lot of money.

37
00:09:41,974 --> 00:09:44,026
But you will make twice that.

38
00:09:44,101 --> 00:09:47,815
Furthermore, I will give you my oldest
daughter. No other girl in town

39
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:50,017
will have a dowry and a hope chest
like she has.

40
00:09:50,067 --> 00:09:53,580
Our cans are now bringing
Venetian mirrors, lace from Brussels,

41
00:09:53,655 --> 00:09:56,669
Indian spices, fine china

42
00:09:56,742 --> 00:10:00,207
Japanese pearls,
and brilliants cut in Amsterdam.

43
00:10:00,288 --> 00:10:02,045
This is my best transaction.

44
00:10:02,095 --> 00:10:03,826
I have invested everything I have
into it.

45
00:10:03,876 --> 00:10:05,882
Us too.

46
00:10:05,962 --> 00:10:08,383
Sirs, why quarrel?...

47
00:10:08,465 --> 00:10:11,183
My bill of exchange was due
in the morning...

48
00:10:11,261 --> 00:10:13,562
Do not forget about me.

49
00:10:14,556 --> 00:10:17,903
I have never remained anyone's debtor.

50
00:10:20,355 --> 00:10:24,746
This is the end of the road. We have
to hack our way through the bushes.

51
00:10:50,519 --> 00:10:52,275
Stop.

52
00:10:52,396 --> 00:10:54,733
Step back.
Step back.

53
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:21,686
What's going on?.

54
00:12:00,816 --> 00:12:02,821
What was that?

55
00:12:36,027 --> 00:12:38,496
Stop. Be quiet.

56
00:13:23,253 --> 00:13:24,891
Go on.

57
00:13:24,964 --> 00:13:27,266
There's a road beyond those bushes.

58
00:13:37,813 --> 00:13:41,112
Turn the cans.
Get back quick.

59
00:16:48,346 --> 00:16:50,482
Doctor, I beg your pardon, that

60
00:16:50,557 --> 00:16:55,731
The mill is in a desolate state,
sorry,

61
00:16:55,939 --> 00:16:57,825
but that mill wheel must be repaired.

62
00:17:18,050 --> 00:17:19,604
Love gone with the wind.

63
00:17:19,677 --> 00:17:21,765
Had your goldsmith
not pressed those Lou's...

64
00:17:21,815 --> 00:17:24,842
At least he didn't take our furniture
like your sleeping spice merchant did.

65
00:17:24,892 --> 00:17:26,093
Only the carriage and house.

66
00:17:26,143 --> 00:17:29,110
We'll be sleeping under the bridge yet

67
00:17:29,189 --> 00:17:33,532
When we do get married
the toes will be peeping out of our shoes.

68
00:17:33,611 --> 00:17:36,080
Father will sell the stars above...

69
00:17:36,156 --> 00:17:39,040
At market he'll sell the sunshine...

70
00:17:39,118 --> 00:17:42,880
Great business that'll be,
with Julie calling out:

71
00:17:42,956 --> 00:17:48,012
Buy a penny worth of sun...

72
00:17:48,296 --> 00:17:49,887
Sunshine made of gold.

73
00:17:49,965 --> 00:17:51,805
Were it to help Daddy...

74
00:17:51,884 --> 00:17:54,139
How noble of her.

75
00:17:54,220 --> 00:17:56,392
Were it to help father,

76
00:17:56,473 --> 00:17:59,404
she'd sell the last cracked mug...

77
00:18:02,523 --> 00:18:04,742
The three-legged table.

78
00:18:04,817 --> 00:18:08,247
Her mother's portrait,
witch nobody wanted.

79
00:18:09,657 --> 00:18:13,335
The plaster frame alone
would fetch a string of pearls for me.

80
00:18:13,411 --> 00:18:15,002
And a diamond necklace.

81
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:16,373
And an opal ring.

82
00:18:16,457 --> 00:18:17,549
A sapphire tiara.

83
00:18:17,625 --> 00:18:19,761
A hat with ostrich feathers.

84
00:18:19,836 --> 00:18:21,011
A dog collar.

85
00:18:21,088 --> 00:18:23,473
Some cat droppings.

86
00:18:23,716 --> 00:18:26,849
Finished sharing our that portrait?

87
00:18:33,353 --> 00:18:35,940
We're not starving yet.

88
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:50,002
Father...

89
00:18:50,416 --> 00:18:52,671
They wanted to get married.

90
00:18:52,753 --> 00:18:56,384
They'll never forgive me
for becoming a beggar.

91
00:18:58,051 --> 00:19:00,104
<i>_</i> Don't be unhappy.

92
00:19:00,179 --> 00:19:02,398
It wasn't your fault.

93
00:19:02,473 --> 00:19:05,155
A merchant must be ready for anything.

94
00:19:05,644 --> 00:19:09,239
That portrait-painter
was paid in gold abroad.

95
00:19:09,315 --> 00:19:11,867
I paid him in gold too.

96
00:19:13,904 --> 00:19:15,993
I loved her.

97
00:19:17,701 --> 00:19:21,249
Let her forgive me,
if I try and sell it now.

98
00:19:29,424 --> 00:19:31,264
Come.

99
00:19:31,468 --> 00:19:34,732
Your sisters wanted gold and diamonds.

100
00:19:35,348 --> 00:19:36,523
And you?

101
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:38,024
A golden carriage?

102
00:19:38,728 --> 00:19:40,318
How about the Moon?

103
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:44,075
Would a way side rose do?

104
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:49,831
Just if you come back.

105
00:19:55,999 --> 00:19:58,634
You should not go in the night.

106
00:19:59,295 --> 00:20:01,550
Keep away from the Black Wood.
It's bewitched.

107
00:20:01,631 --> 00:20:06,806
The story your mother told you,
I know.

108
00:20:08,098 --> 00:20:11,361
An evil spell
on forest and mansion...

109
00:20:13,355 --> 00:20:16,036
You are so much like her.

110
00:20:16,734 --> 00:20:19,949
As of she were standing here herself.

111
00:28:39,995 --> 00:28:43,092
Thank you.

112
00:29:17,459 --> 00:29:19,511
Thank you, Sir.

113
00:29:19,586 --> 00:29:24,761
Whoever you may be,
you have paid a princely price.

114
00:29:40,196 --> 00:29:44,503
Hiding behind the others
and yet the prettiest of all.

115
00:29:44,827 --> 00:29:46,879
Like Julie.

116
00:29:50,918 --> 00:29:54,015
I should have left you to the wolves

117
00:29:54,088 --> 00:29:55,975
My rose...

118
00:29:57,342 --> 00:29:59,395
Look at me.

119
00:30:01,890 --> 00:30:03,730
Dear God.

120
00:30:03,809 --> 00:30:06,194
Look into my eyes.

121
00:30:07,564 --> 00:30:10,448
Do I look kind, and beautiful?

122
00:30:12,987 --> 00:30:14,411
You are

123
00:30:14,489 --> 00:30:17,040
Say what. Quickly.
You are

124
00:30:17,910 --> 00:30:19,713
A monster.

125
00:30:19,787 --> 00:30:21,211
For a single rose...

126
00:30:21,289 --> 00:30:22,713
I gave you gold and gems.

127
00:30:22,791 --> 00:30:24,382
And you plucked my rose...

128
00:30:24,460 --> 00:30:25,506
I have three daughters.

129
00:30:25,586 --> 00:30:28,435
The rose was for my youngest.

130
00:30:32,095 --> 00:30:36,023
Should one of the three
come to me

131
00:30:36,642 --> 00:30:39,775
of her own free will
you can live.

132
00:30:41,315 --> 00:30:42,407
<i>_</i> No.

133
00:30:42,483 --> 00:30:43,906
You can save your life...

134
00:30:51,870 --> 00:30:53,958
But permit me to say goodbye,

135
00:30:55,165 --> 00:30:58,263
to arrange for their future.

136
00:30:58,837 --> 00:31:02,718
I'll be back

137
00:31:04,260 --> 00:31:05,554
I swear.

138
00:31:07,097 --> 00:31:09,483
Can Man be trusted?

139
00:31:11,394 --> 00:31:13,732
Give her the rose.

140
00:31:20,781 --> 00:31:23,119
This is wonderful.

141
00:31:29,042 --> 00:31:31,297
I'm so happy.

142
00:32:04,712 --> 00:32:07,560
Now you can have whatever you want.

143
00:32:07,632 --> 00:32:10,053
Who's the horse for?

144
00:32:10,761 --> 00:32:14,855
That horse is taking me back
into service.

145
00:32:15,642 --> 00:32:17,612
A mirror.

146
00:32:17,728 --> 00:32:19,781
Let me see.

147
00:32:30,619 --> 00:32:32,921
When will you be back, father?

148
00:32:32,997 --> 00:32:37,638
I may have to take a long trip.

149
00:32:40,173 --> 00:32:42,558
Far beyond the sea.

150
00:32:42,676 --> 00:32:45,358
Something's worrying you.

151
00:32:48,517 --> 00:32:50,273
You have a fever.

152
00:32:50,353 --> 00:32:52,939
Only from happiness.

153
00:33:01,408 --> 00:33:06,214
I brought you
the most precious thing of all.

154
00:33:06,540 --> 00:33:08,261
Yes?

155
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:10,467
The most precious?

156
00:33:10,545 --> 00:33:13,345
They had nothing cheaper?

157
00:33:14,174 --> 00:33:16,726
That rose will cost me my life.

158
00:33:16,803 --> 00:33:18,974
But father...

159
00:33:20,683 --> 00:33:23,151
That's why the horse is waiting.

160
00:33:26,148 --> 00:33:28,617
I promised to return.

161
00:33:30,737 --> 00:33:33,787
Unless one of you

162
00:33:33,908 --> 00:33:37,503
were to offer your own life for mine.

163
00:33:37,871 --> 00:33:40,921
Now that we can marry anyone,
even a Duke?

164
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,385
Not even Dukes have such gems.

165
00:33:43,461 --> 00:33:45,763
Maybe soon a carriage will drive
into our yard,

166
00:33:45,881 --> 00:33:47,934
with a coat of arms painted
on its door...

167
00:34:31,689 --> 00:34:34,158
Enjoying her beauty?

168
00:34:35,652 --> 00:34:38,157
See that white throat?

169
00:34:39,365 --> 00:34:42,249
You know how sweet her blood will be.

170
00:34:42,327 --> 00:34:44,250
Be quiet.

171
00:43:29,827 --> 00:43:31,963
Running away?

172
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,587
I don't need her blood.

173
00:43:37,921 --> 00:43:40,057
The wood is full of does.

174
00:43:49,936 --> 00:43:52,155
There is still time turn back.

175
00:43:52,231 --> 00:43:54,782
You must kill her.
Right now.

176
00:43:54,859 --> 00:43:57,244
Or she will bring about your end.

177
00:43:57,320 --> 00:44:00,002
Her beauty,
her voice,

178
00:44:00,074 --> 00:44:01,664
her innocent head.

179
00:44:01,743 --> 00:44:03,546
Quiet.

180
00:45:46,250 --> 00:45:48,718
How repulsive a face.

181
00:45:50,213 --> 00:45:53,975
Blood everywhere.
Stan feeling sorry for the doe next.

182
00:45:54,051 --> 00:45:56,816
Gone is your peace of mind.

183
00:45:56,972 --> 00:46:01,778
As an animal
you were alone and happy.

184
00:46:03,063 --> 00:46:05,033
Your soul knew nothing

185
00:46:05,441 --> 00:46:10,116
of hate or love.

186
00:46:10,906 --> 00:46:14,787
Your animal habits limited
but also protected you.

187
00:46:15,286 --> 00:46:17,791
But my voice is human.

188
00:46:17,873 --> 00:46:20,460
Therein lies your curse.

189
00:46:20,543 --> 00:46:23,593
Neither bird, nor beast, nor Man...

190
00:46:25,674 --> 00:46:28,179
Today I loathe myself.

191
00:46:29,638 --> 00:46:33,400
You could have had her.

192
00:46:34,811 --> 00:46:38,655
That white brow,
eyelids like two white rose petals,

193
00:46:40,235 --> 00:46:43,581
a body trembling
with tender disquiet.

194
00:46:45,408 --> 00:46:48,623
What if those rose blossom lids lift

195
00:46:49,538 --> 00:46:52,007
and her eyes rest upon you?

196
00:46:52,083 --> 00:46:54,634
She must never see me.

197
00:46:55,003 --> 00:46:58,931
She would die of terror.
She should be dead by now.

198
00:46:59,676 --> 00:47:03,141
All that had to be done was to press
her white throat a little harder.

199
00:47:06,309 --> 00:47:08,896
But there is still time.

200
00:47:08,946 --> 00:47:10,765
If you don't press that white throat
harder

201
00:47:10,815 --> 00:47:14,162
you will feel your curse
a hundred fold.

202
00:47:15,404 --> 00:47:19,367
You must kill her tonight.

203
00:47:19,993 --> 00:47:22,497
Yes, I shall kill her.

204
00:49:42,131 --> 00:49:44,137
Who is it?

205
00:49:45,427 --> 00:49:47,978
Is there anybody here?

206
00:50:32,278 --> 00:50:34,533
Don't turn round.

207
00:50:34,614 --> 00:50:36,869
Stay as you are.

208
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:40,296
Did I frighten you?

209
00:50:43,417 --> 00:50:46,550
If it's a game you want to play...

210
00:50:47,797 --> 00:50:51,856
But it is not pleasant
to have a strange man behind you.

211
00:50:53,888 --> 00:50:56,226
Man, did you say?

212
00:50:58,519 --> 00:51:00,940
I meant no offence,

213
00:51:02,232 --> 00:51:04,819
but you are a stranger.

214
00:51:07,948 --> 00:51:10,832
Your father told you nothing?

215
00:51:13,038 --> 00:51:17,844
Only that he must die
because he plucked your rose.

216
00:51:18,002 --> 00:51:20,090
Nothing more?

217
00:51:21,757 --> 00:51:23,679
Did he not force you to come?

218
00:51:28,182 --> 00:51:30,484
You came of your own free will?

219
00:51:32,479 --> 00:51:35,694
Making this sacrifice for your father?

220
00:51:37,235 --> 00:51:39,537
Don't turn round.

221
00:51:42,032 --> 00:51:45,213
You admired my statues this morning.

222
00:51:48,916 --> 00:51:51,551
I'll visit you every evening,

223
00:51:51,628 --> 00:51:54,309
but do not try to see me.

224
00:51:54,799 --> 00:51:57,350
Why, what would happen?

225
00:52:00,222 --> 00:52:02,310
Are you here?

226
00:52:04,561 --> 00:52:06,282
Sir.

227
00:54:46,307 --> 00:54:48,562
Stay as you are.

228
00:54:50,854 --> 00:54:53,359
It's nearly midnight...

229
00:54:53,733 --> 00:54:56,154
I've been far away.

230
00:55:00,909 --> 00:55:03,413
Did you hurt yourself?

231
00:55:03,704 --> 00:55:06,422
There's blood on the rose.

232
00:55:07,459 --> 00:55:10,045
It grows in the forest,

233
00:55:15,260 --> 00:55:18,440
by the well where does come to drink.

234
00:55:20,141 --> 00:55:22,229
Tell me more.

235
00:55:22,519 --> 00:55:24,905
I like listening to you.

236
00:55:24,981 --> 00:55:27,746
You have a lovely voice.

237
00:55:27,859 --> 00:55:30,993
The moon is mirrored in the waters.

238
00:55:31,447 --> 00:55:34,663
The forest is fragrant,
the does lap up the water thirstily,

239
00:55:34,743 --> 00:55:37,627
seeing and hearing nothing...

240
00:55:40,125 --> 00:55:41,715
And then?

241
00:55:41,794 --> 00:55:43,550
I do not know.

242
00:55:45,256 --> 00:55:47,891
I want you to be happy here.

243
00:55:47,968 --> 00:55:49,261
May I stay a little longer?

244
00:55:49,330 --> 00:55:50,421
You are the master here.

245
00:55:50,471 --> 00:55:55,361
No, you are the mistress
of the whole of this mansion.

246
00:55:59,024 --> 00:56:01,824
But I am alone all the time.

247
01:00:46,971 --> 01:00:49,059
Please play.

248
01:00:55,732 --> 01:00:57,868
Good evening.

249
01:00:58,235 --> 01:01:00,704
Good evening, Julie.

250
01:01:01,906 --> 01:01:04,043
Are you being looked after?

251
01:01:04,118 --> 01:01:06,254
Generously, as always.
Thank you.

252
01:01:06,537 --> 01:01:08,543
Are you happy here?

253
01:01:08,623 --> 01:01:10,095
At least a little?

254
01:01:10,167 --> 01:01:12,173
Yes, but
I know.

255
01:01:12,253 --> 01:01:15,433
You stood by the gate all afternoon...

256
01:01:16,508 --> 01:01:18,929
You miss your home.

257
01:01:20,472 --> 01:01:21,729
Your father

258
01:01:21,807 --> 01:01:24,062
ls he all right?

259
01:01:24,560 --> 01:01:27,325
I shall tell you how he is
every evening.

260
01:01:27,397 --> 01:01:29,652
How good of you.

261
01:01:29,942 --> 01:01:31,948
What is he doing now?

262
01:01:32,028 --> 01:01:34,497
He is alive and well.

263
01:01:35,824 --> 01:01:37,795
Thank you.

264
01:01:38,369 --> 01:01:41,087
God, please, may it be true.

265
01:01:42,041 --> 01:01:44,971
You suspect me of lying to you?

266
01:01:45,879 --> 01:01:49,391
If you want proof,
walk our onto the terrace.

267
01:01:51,636 --> 01:01:53,689
The terrace?

268
01:02:11,286 --> 01:02:13,208
Pull that curtain aside.

269
01:02:13,831 --> 01:02:16,299
There's only a wall.

270
01:02:23,343 --> 01:02:25,514
Open the door.

271
01:02:35,024 --> 01:02:36,317
My father,

272
01:02:37,152 --> 01:02:39,122
my sisters and their suitors.

273
01:02:39,196 --> 01:02:40,952
Two poor Princes.

274
01:02:41,407 --> 01:02:43,994
But your sisters are happy.

275
01:02:57,678 --> 01:02:59,232
If I only knew

276
01:02:59,555 --> 01:03:01,228
what happened to her...

277
01:03:02,392 --> 01:03:04,528
Who is he talking about?
We had another sister.

278
01:03:05,396 --> 01:03:07,484
May I go down?
- No.

279
01:03:07,565 --> 01:03:09,203
Just for a moment.

280
01:03:09,276 --> 01:03:12,539
To tell them I'm alive.

281
01:03:29,009 --> 01:03:30,765
I promised that you would see him,

282
01:03:30,845 --> 01:03:33,563
not that he would see you...

283
01:03:41,692 --> 01:03:42,511
You are beautiful.

284
01:03:42,568 --> 01:03:45,534
My dowry must be huge
to make you say such things...

285
01:03:45,613 --> 01:03:47,749
I
Get as much out of father as you can.

286
01:03:48,075 --> 01:03:51,041
I have my reward.
This dance.

287
01:03:51,329 --> 01:03:52,966
Don't be so modest.

288
01:03:53,039 --> 01:03:54,926
I pay my debts too...

289
01:04:16,778 --> 01:04:18,866
I'm taking this mirror.

290
01:04:18,947 --> 01:04:20,371
No, it's mine.

291
01:04:20,616 --> 01:04:23,001
Father promised it to me.

292
01:04:53,115 --> 01:04:54,955
That was cruel of you.

293
01:04:59,665 --> 01:05:01,505
Poor father.

294
01:05:03,170 --> 01:05:05,970
Why don't you say something?.

295
01:05:06,173 --> 01:05:07,681
You come here every evening

296
01:05:07,759 --> 01:05:10,856
and I'm not allowed to see you...

297
01:05:11,472 --> 01:05:13,193
I hate you.

298
01:05:13,850 --> 01:05:14,775
Shall I go?

299
01:05:19,691 --> 01:05:21,743
Please stay.

300
01:05:24,572 --> 01:05:27,456
It's all worse when I'm alone.

301
01:05:36,420 --> 01:05:38,722
I had decided to lift the piano top

302
01:05:38,798 --> 01:05:41,219
to catch a glimpse of you.

303
01:05:41,385 --> 01:05:43,971
Then I became afraid.

304
01:05:45,306 --> 01:05:47,312
I'm afraid to turn round.

305
01:05:47,392 --> 01:05:50,110
Not of your anger, though.

306
01:05:50,646 --> 01:05:55,488
I'm afraid I'll see nobody.

307
01:05:58,323 --> 01:05:59,960
That I'm all alone here.

308
01:06:03,663 --> 01:06:05,253
Quite alone.

309
01:06:09,587 --> 01:06:12,305
That I made up all I hear.

310
01:06:15,678 --> 01:06:17,518
Your voice, your steps,

311
01:06:17,680 --> 01:06:20,232
your breath, even the rose.

312
01:06:29,904 --> 01:06:31,458
And even your words.

313
01:06:33,784 --> 01:06:35,256
Who speaks your words?

314
01:06:35,912 --> 01:06:40,634
My soul does if I have one...

315
01:06:42,253 --> 01:06:44,753
Those words are beautiful,
but I do not understand them.

316
01:06:48,887 --> 01:06:50,441
Who are you?

317
01:06:51,265 --> 01:06:53,068
I don't even know your name.

318
01:06:53,184 --> 01:06:55,236
Don't be in such a rush.

319
01:06:56,104 --> 01:06:58,608
You will give me a name some day.

320
01:06:59,650 --> 01:07:02,035
And I live in terror of that day.

321
01:07:02,362 --> 01:07:04,747
Why speak so mysteriously?

322
01:07:05,324 --> 01:07:07,911
I am happy in your company.

323
01:07:09,287 --> 01:07:11,015
Give me your hand.
I want to touch you.

324
01:07:14,627 --> 01:07:17,013
We torment each other.

325
01:07:19,050 --> 01:07:22,479
You have never dined with me.

326
01:07:26,643 --> 01:07:28,980
Never drank a toast with me.

327
01:07:39,409 --> 01:07:40,916
Will you now?

328
01:07:41,828 --> 01:07:44,712
Lift the goblet higher.

329
01:07:58,099 --> 01:08:01,065
No.
What happened?

330
01:08:06,359 --> 01:08:08,780
Have I offended you?

331
01:08:18,124 --> 01:08:20,094
Come back.

332
01:08:21,879 --> 01:08:24,597
Don't leave me here alone.

333
01:08:31,516 --> 01:08:33,023
Hands.

334
01:08:33,644 --> 01:08:35,281
Human hands.

335
01:08:37,065 --> 01:08:40,079
I have human hands.
All the worse for you.

336
01:08:41,195 --> 01:08:44,245
Your visage expels you
from amongst the humans,

337
01:08:45,617 --> 01:08:49,545
your human hands shut you out
from the world of beast and bird.

338
01:08:49,622 --> 01:08:51,545
Now you are truly alone.

339
01:08:54,170 --> 01:08:56,140
Defenceless, ridiculous.

340
01:08:59,218 --> 01:09:01,899
For twenty years
everything trembled before you,

341
01:09:02,013 --> 01:09:05,395
no human dared enter your Kingdom.

342
01:09:06,644 --> 01:09:08,447
I am happy.

343
01:09:09,523 --> 01:09:12,738
I'd like to tell her of my happiness.

344
01:09:15,906 --> 01:09:19,834
But how can she share my joy,
she has not seen my hideous face,

345
01:09:20,370 --> 01:09:22,292
she knows only my voice...

346
01:09:23,665 --> 01:09:27,012
Give her proof of your love.
- Perhaps.

347
01:09:28,129 --> 01:09:32,390
Kill her before she sees you.

348
01:09:33,011 --> 01:09:35,562
So kill yourself.
How?

349
01:09:36,724 --> 01:09:38,729
Let her go.

350
01:09:39,727 --> 01:09:42,279
She would not come back.

351
01:09:50,866 --> 01:09:53,501
Surely I don't love him?

352
01:09:54,913 --> 01:09:58,046
He has never even seen me...

353
01:09:59,252 --> 01:10:02,302
Maybe he thinks
he's not handsome enough for me?

354
01:10:04,759 --> 01:10:07,228
Or perhaps I for him?

355
01:10:08,555 --> 01:10:10,193
How stupid I am.

356
01:10:12,644 --> 01:10:15,113
It's you?
Forgive me.

357
01:10:15,189 --> 01:10:17,360
I came unexpectedly.

358
01:10:17,442 --> 01:10:18,996
What happened?

359
01:10:19,695 --> 01:10:21,617
Nothing.
Only

360
01:10:22,573 --> 01:10:24,793
Shall I go?
Why?

361
01:10:25,744 --> 01:10:27,381
Do stay.

362
01:10:31,459 --> 01:10:33,346
I have not asked for permission

363
01:10:33,796 --> 01:10:35,848
to pay visits in the morning.

364
01:10:36,382 --> 01:10:37,936
You know it now.

365
01:10:40,429 --> 01:10:42,766
At least my day will pass more quickly.

366
01:10:42,849 --> 01:10:45,530
I like to hear your voice.

367
01:10:45,644 --> 01:10:47,899
It tells me of what you are like,

368
01:10:47,980 --> 01:10:50,033
it tells about your face.

369
01:10:52,778 --> 01:10:57,750
How strange it all is.
All this magic.

370
01:10:58,452 --> 01:11:01,252
A table which spreads itself,

371
01:11:01,956 --> 01:11:04,342
a fire which flares up
when it is cold...

372
01:11:04,543 --> 01:11:06,549
Your whole mansion.

373
01:11:06,629 --> 01:11:09,560
The tales my mother told me

374
01:11:09,841 --> 01:11:12,179
I love you, Julie.

375
01:11:13,930 --> 01:11:16,861
You speak of love
as of you really loved me...

376
01:11:22,107 --> 01:11:23,661
What a beautiful hand.

377
01:11:24,944 --> 01:11:27,032
I know your voice,
now I've seen your hand.

378
01:11:28,907 --> 01:11:30,635
You only say that
out of embarrassment.

379
01:11:31,911 --> 01:11:33,833
I'm not used to compliments.

380
01:11:34,706 --> 01:11:38,385
Every woman has the power
to make beautiful the man she loves.

381
01:11:38,669 --> 01:11:40,757
But today I am happy.

382
01:11:42,674 --> 01:11:44,146
Be quiet for a while.

383
01:11:51,185 --> 01:11:56,193
May I see you soon?

384
01:11:59,946 --> 01:12:01,999
I dream of you so often.

385
01:12:03,451 --> 01:12:06,169
In my dreams I see you...

386
01:12:07,205 --> 01:12:11,050
Your face,
Your eyes,

387
01:12:12,796 --> 01:12:14,089
your lips.

388
01:12:18,178 --> 01:12:20,017
My first night here I dreamt

389
01:12:20,472 --> 01:12:22,229
that you saved my life.

390
01:12:23,643 --> 01:12:25,446
You took me in your arms

391
01:12:26,229 --> 01:12:28,069
and carried me to safety.

392
01:12:30,819 --> 01:12:32,990
Go on dreaming.

393
01:12:43,376 --> 01:12:45,678
When you dream about my likeness,

394
01:12:45,754 --> 01:12:47,890
you create it.

395
01:12:49,300 --> 01:12:51,388
The more ardently you dream,

396
01:12:51,470 --> 01:12:54,056
the sooner will see me.

397
01:12:55,433 --> 01:12:58,317
And I will resemble your dream.

398
01:13:00,523 --> 01:13:02,445
What is it?
What happened?

399
01:13:03,276 --> 01:13:07,667
There's somebody here.
Something terrible.

400
01:13:07,740 --> 01:13:10,422
There, in the glass.

401
01:13:10,619 --> 01:13:14,381
A strange, terrible face

402
01:13:15,917 --> 01:13:18,302
Where are you, don't go.

403
01:13:18,796 --> 01:13:21,347
Say something.
Before I go mad.

404
01:13:22,300 --> 01:13:24,353
That was me.

405
01:13:24,678 --> 01:13:27,645
Say something that makes sense.

406
01:13:28,016 --> 01:13:29,653
That was me.

407
01:13:29,726 --> 01:13:32,277
You saw my face, Julie.

408
01:13:32,897 --> 01:13:34,819
You can turn round now.

409
01:13:35,317 --> 01:13:37,951
Is there anything worse
to be afraid of?.

410
01:13:51,379 --> 01:13:53,265
Don't be afraid.

411
01:13:53,339 --> 01:13:55,844
I'll go away.
And I will never come back.

412
01:13:58,221 --> 01:14:01,104
I don't deserve to stand beside you.

413
01:14:02,393 --> 01:14:04,529
You are beautiful.

414
01:14:05,480 --> 01:14:08,862
I am a monster.

415
01:14:10,570 --> 01:14:12,290
You are frightening,

416
01:14:12,364 --> 01:14:15,912
but not evil.

417
01:14:17,870 --> 01:14:21,253
Why did you deceive me?.

418
01:14:24,921 --> 01:14:28,137
You would have fled with horror
that first night.

419
01:14:28,592 --> 01:14:32,141
And I'd have been forced
to hound you through the woods

420
01:14:32,639 --> 01:14:36,353
and finally to kill you.
I don't believe that.

421
01:14:37,604 --> 01:14:40,024
When I see your hands

422
01:14:40,149 --> 01:14:42,071
and hear your voice

423
01:14:46,991 --> 01:14:48,664
Say something.

424
01:14:49,994 --> 01:14:51,632
Give me your hand.

425
01:14:52,331 --> 01:14:54,087
You are too good.

426
01:14:54,542 --> 01:14:55,965
Don't force yourself.

427
01:14:56,294 --> 01:14:57,885
I do not want to hold you prisoner.

428
01:14:58,630 --> 01:15:01,894
You know that door being the curtain.

429
01:15:02,260 --> 01:15:04,100
You can leave.

430
01:15:06,766 --> 01:15:08,688
I love you, Julie.

431
01:15:10,645 --> 01:15:12,651
Let us stay like this.

432
01:15:15,360 --> 01:15:17,033
Let's never wake up.

433
01:15:17,237 --> 01:15:19,539
Goodbye, Julie.

434
01:15:22,619 --> 01:15:24,838
Don't

435
01:15:27,375 --> 01:15:29,546
Don't stand there with your back to me.

436
01:15:31,463 --> 01:15:33,054
Turn round.

437
01:15:44,981 --> 01:15:46,867
Go away.

438
01:19:46,869 --> 01:19:48,922
That vase is mine.
I saw it first.

439
01:19:49,373 --> 01:19:51,959
And Daddy said
No. You have the oil lamp.

440
01:19:52,043 --> 01:19:54,262
Let go.
Give it to me.

441
01:19:57,456 --> 01:19:59,502
Where's she sprung from?
We must be bewitched.

442
01:19:59,552 --> 01:20:01,392
Julie's long dead.

443
01:20:01,596 --> 01:20:03,317
Surely you're not scared of me?

444
01:20:04,684 --> 01:20:07,532
What are you afraid of?

445
01:20:07,604 --> 01:20:09,610
She's no ghost.

446
01:20:13,111 --> 01:20:14,665
Sisters...

447
01:20:14,947 --> 01:20:19,005
Look.
We've never had such a dress.

448
01:20:19,661 --> 01:20:21,334
Let me try it on.

449
01:20:21,413 --> 01:20:24,095
And the slippers.
Finer than any leather I've seen.

450
01:20:24,584 --> 01:20:26,387
And the golden beads.

451
01:20:26,753 --> 01:20:28,141
Enough to buy a palace with.

452
01:20:28,191 --> 01:20:30,332
Had I known this,
I'd have gone to the monster myself.

453
01:20:30,432 --> 01:20:32,102
And the diamonds.

454
01:20:32,177 --> 01:20:34,681
Lend it to me.

455
01:20:35,097 --> 01:20:38,063
Let me see.
Wait.

456
01:20:39,352 --> 01:20:42,865
I'm here too.
And we haven't even kissed yet...

457
01:20:44,359 --> 01:20:49,331
We've been so worried about you.
Where's Daddy?

458
01:20:49,574 --> 01:20:52,873
And your husbands?
I saw them and nearly envied you.

459
01:20:53,662 --> 01:20:55,003
Where did you see them?

460
01:20:55,081 --> 01:20:56,754
At the pub or with the sluts?

461
01:20:56,875 --> 01:21:00,257
There's some wine left from
the wedding, so they might be coming.

462
01:21:00,337 --> 01:21:05,512
Let's surprise them,
do lend me your dress.

463
01:21:05,761 --> 01:21:08,526
I'll buy it off you.
My husband

464
01:21:08,598 --> 01:21:11,980
He'd rather bite off a finger
than pull out his purse.

465
01:21:12,060 --> 01:21:14,991
And yours counts out the very peas
you cook for lunch.

466
01:21:15,648 --> 01:21:18,947
Lend me your bracelet.
Your dress, I asked first.

467
01:21:19,403 --> 01:21:20,531
Sisters...

468
01:21:22,198 --> 01:21:24,370
He calls this a house...
That shack of a house.

469
01:21:24,618 --> 01:21:27,418
Our wives don't know
how lucky they are

470
01:21:27,497 --> 01:21:30,760
That we married them...
Old and ugly as they are...

471
01:21:31,001 --> 01:21:34,799
Father.
Julie. You're back.

472
01:21:36,258 --> 01:21:38,678
He didn't kill you.

473
01:21:48,940 --> 01:21:51,326
Well?

474
01:21:56,909 --> 01:21:58,879
The witch.

475
01:22:00,330 --> 01:22:01,801
To the stake with her.

476
01:22:03,042 --> 01:22:05,296
Look at that.

477
01:22:12,887 --> 01:22:16,317
While she's here,
I'll not cross this threshold again.

478
01:22:17,852 --> 01:22:19,240
Let's go.

479
01:22:23,776 --> 01:22:28,167
Gems, here at father in law's?
All the wine gone too.

480
01:22:28,240 --> 01:22:29,533
Greedy Wildcats.

481
01:22:29,742 --> 01:22:34,465
As long as there was something
to take away... Come, you must be tired.

482
01:22:35,749 --> 01:22:39,096
I've never forgiven myself
for letting you make the sacrifice.

483
01:22:39,170 --> 01:22:41,093
Please don't talk about it.

484
01:22:41,215 --> 01:22:44,478
How happy I am to be home.

485
01:23:18,762 --> 01:23:20,316
Is it you?

486
01:23:21,182 --> 01:23:22,689
Did you call me?

487
01:23:25,729 --> 01:23:27,236
What's the matter with you?

488
01:23:27,315 --> 01:23:29,154
There's nobody here.

489
01:23:29,275 --> 01:23:30,783
We are alone.

490
01:23:33,739 --> 01:23:35,330
And that rose?

491
01:23:35,408 --> 01:23:39,550
From the garden.
It's dying.

492
01:23:40,665 --> 01:23:43,134
It snowed last night.

493
01:24:27,391 --> 01:24:29,194
Do you hear me?

494
01:24:30,686 --> 01:24:32,324
Are you alone?

495
01:24:33,774 --> 01:24:37,369
No. Don't think of me.
I've stopped thinking of you, too.

496
01:24:37,612 --> 01:24:41,125
He's cast a spell over you.
But I shan't let you go.

497
01:24:41,200 --> 01:24:42,956
I have only you now.

498
01:24:43,035 --> 01:24:45,255
I'm waiting for you, Julie.

499
01:24:45,956 --> 01:24:47,546
I love you.

500
01:24:48,292 --> 01:24:49,846
Please come back.

501
01:24:50,670 --> 01:24:52,177
I'm cold.

502
01:25:10,195 --> 01:25:11,749
Where are you?

503
01:25:28,092 --> 01:25:29,267
I'm dying.

504
01:25:29,594 --> 01:25:31,564
All my servants have gone.

505
01:25:32,014 --> 01:25:34,483
With human hands
I cannot kill even a fawn.

506
01:25:41,526 --> 01:25:43,116
Julie.

507
01:25:46,032 --> 01:25:47,705
You are ridiculous.

508
01:25:49,870 --> 01:25:52,919
Full of that human fear of death...

509
01:25:55,126 --> 01:25:58,840
When you loved no one
you never thought of death.

510
01:25:59,757 --> 01:26:01,099
Now you know

511
01:26:01,551 --> 01:26:04,482
that you will die
once you have changed into a human.

512
01:26:05,640 --> 01:26:07,194
Even at that price.

513
01:26:09,770 --> 01:26:12,404
Why?
For whom...?

514
01:26:13,942 --> 01:26:16,956
You have eyes,
but you'll never see her again.

515
01:26:18,322 --> 01:26:21,705
You have arms,
but whom will embrace...?

516
01:26:31,088 --> 01:26:32,346
I love her.

517
01:26:47,985 --> 01:26:49,991
You mustn't die.

518
01:26:54,493 --> 01:26:56,463
This isn't me.

519
01:26:56,537 --> 01:26:58,258
These aren't my eyes.

520
01:26:59,040 --> 01:27:01,509
Yes they are.

521
01:27:02,253 --> 01:27:06,395
My eyes have changed because I'm dying.

522
01:27:08,260 --> 01:27:10,231
If this is death,

523
01:27:12,266 --> 01:27:16,573
I die of longing for you, Julie.

524
01:27:38,799 --> 01:27:39,927
My Julie...

525
01:27:41,928 --> 01:27:43,482
Forgive me, Father.

526
01:28:05,958 --> 01:28:07,465
Where are you?

527
01:28:08,587 --> 01:28:10,509
Don't torment me.

528
01:28:21,895 --> 01:28:23,449
Let yourself be heard.

529
01:28:52,893 --> 01:28:54,614
Wake up.

530
01:28:55,563 --> 01:28:57,818
You mustn't die.

531
01:28:59,067 --> 01:29:02,247
I don't care what you look like,
to me you are beautiful.

532
01:29:04,240 --> 01:29:05,747
You said

533
01:29:06,368 --> 01:29:10,082
every woman had the power
to make beautiful the man she loves...

534
01:29:58,934 --> 01:30:03,195
The voice...
The eyes...

535
01:30:05,985 --> 01:30:07,539
Yes, it is you.
