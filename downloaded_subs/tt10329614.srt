00:02:05,883 --> 00:02:06,918
Hang on.

3
00:02:39,984 --> 00:02:41,919
Not still going over it?

4
00:02:42,053 --> 00:02:44,922
Well, if we're passing it
as an 18, it needs more cuts.

5
00:02:45,555 --> 00:02:47,258
The decapitation?

6
00:02:47,391 --> 00:02:50,660
Nope. No, the decapitation
is ridiculous.

7
00:02:51,429 --> 00:02:53,064
It's the, er,
it's the eye gouging...

8
00:02:53,197 --> 00:02:55,366
it's too, it's too realistic.

9
00:02:55,498 --> 00:02:58,102
Plus, I was trying to see
who dragged her away.

10
00:02:58,535 --> 00:03:00,104
Does it matter?

11
00:03:02,073 --> 00:03:04,175
Well, would be nice if it has some
clear retribution after all the...

12
00:03:04,241 --> 00:03:07,411
I appreciate you analyzing this
with such precision, Enid,

13
00:03:07,544 --> 00:03:09,413
but perhaps someone
got out of the cautious side

14
00:03:09,479 --> 00:03:10,580
of bed this morning?

15
00:03:10,714 --> 00:03:12,515
Well, I'm just doing my job.

16
00:03:12,649 --> 00:03:14,185
You're missing
the intellectual layer,

17
00:03:14,251 --> 00:03:15,953
- my dear.
- Oh, come on, we both saw how...

18
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:17,487
The heightened references
take the edge off

19
00:03:17,554 --> 00:03:19,056
the more realistic violence.

20
00:03:19,323 --> 00:03:23,727
See it less as an eye gouging,
more part of a grand tradition.

21
00:03:23,861 --> 00:03:26,030
It's no worse
than the Cyclops in Homer.

22
00:03:26,163 --> 00:03:28,165
It's Gloucester in <i>Lear.</i>

23
00:03:28,299 --> 00:03:31,035
It's... <i>Un Chien Andalou.</i>

24
00:03:35,672 --> 00:03:38,809
I've salvaged the tug of war
with the intestines.

25
00:03:38,943 --> 00:03:41,846
I've kept in most
of the screwdriver stuff.

26
00:03:42,512 --> 00:03:45,816
And I've only trimmed
the tiniest bit

27
00:03:45,883 --> 00:03:47,584
off the end of the genitals.

28
00:03:48,919 --> 00:03:51,654
But some things should be left
to the imagination.

29
00:03:52,423 --> 00:03:54,158
It's like <i>Rat Brothel</i>
all over again.

30
00:03:54,291 --> 00:03:55,792
No, I just want to get it right.

31
00:03:57,328 --> 00:03:59,263
Plus, you lost the argument
the moment you brought

32
00:03:59,330 --> 00:04:00,597
Shakespeare into the room.

33
00:04:02,766 --> 00:04:05,036
We can't afford
to make mistakes.

34
00:04:05,602 --> 00:04:07,004
I'm cutting it.

35
00:04:10,341 --> 00:04:13,144
<i>As Britain is
invaded by a wave of depraved</i>

36
00:04:13,210 --> 00:04:14,912
<i>and corrupt horror videos,</i>

37
00:04:15,046 --> 00:04:17,248
<i>prosecutions of distributors
of the video nasties...</i>

38
00:04:17,314 --> 00:04:19,417
<i>What we're talking
about are videos that depict</i>

39
00:04:19,483 --> 00:04:21,584
<i>butchering, sadism, murder.</i>

40
00:04:21,718 --> 00:04:23,454
<i>This is dangerous
and hardcore stuff.</i>

41
00:04:23,586 --> 00:04:25,022
<i>And Britain's
rising crime</i>

42
00:04:25,156 --> 00:04:26,457
<i>with one conservative MP</i>

43
00:04:26,524 --> 00:04:27,992
<i>stating that these
violent films</i>

44
00:04:28,125 --> 00:04:30,294
<i>are gnawing
at society's moral fabric.</i>

45
00:04:30,428 --> 00:04:33,563
<i>Violence is an
inherent part of human nature</i>

46
00:04:33,696 --> 00:04:35,499
<i>and it's important
that we find</i>

47
00:04:35,565 --> 00:04:37,034
<i>a cathartic outlet for this</i>

48
00:04:37,134 --> 00:04:39,937
<i>otherwise, it remains pent up,
uncontrolled.</i>

49
00:04:40,004 --> 00:04:41,505
<i>I even heard
from one social worker,</i>

50
00:04:41,638 --> 00:04:43,874
<i>who at 5.30 in the morning
visiting a family,</i>

51
00:04:44,008 --> 00:04:46,110
<i>he wasn't allowed
to start his visit</i>

52
00:04:46,243 --> 00:04:47,244
<i>until the rape scene</i>

53
00:04:47,311 --> 00:04:49,113
<i>from</i> I Spit On Your Grave
<i>had been finished...</i>

54
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:50,780
<i>Far too many
violent images,</i>

55
00:04:50,915 --> 00:04:52,550
<i>which are penetrating
the minds</i>

56
00:04:52,615 --> 00:04:53,551
<i>of impressionable
young children.</i>

57
00:04:53,683 --> 00:04:54,819
<i>There's a real danger</i>

58
00:04:54,885 --> 00:04:56,753
<i>of confusing fiction
with reality.</i>

59
00:04:56,821 --> 00:04:58,755
<i>The raids
up and down the country,</i>

60
00:04:58,889 --> 00:05:01,959
<i>Trading Standards have seized
over four thousand films</i>

61
00:05:02,059 --> 00:05:02,860
<i>from video shops</i>

62
00:05:02,927 --> 00:05:04,161
<i>as well as from private homes.</i>

63
00:05:04,228 --> 00:05:05,362
<i>If this film stays</i>

64
00:05:05,429 --> 00:05:06,729
<i>in your mind...</i>

65
00:05:07,398 --> 00:05:08,798
<i>its presence is corrupting.</i>

66
00:05:08,999 --> 00:05:11,068
<i>These increasingly sadistic</i>

67
00:05:11,135 --> 00:05:13,037
<i>and violent films
are being watched</i>

68
00:05:13,170 --> 00:05:15,705
<i>and rewatched over
and over again.</i>

69
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:17,241
<i>Viewers are like drug addicts</i>

70
00:05:17,374 --> 00:05:19,910
<i>wanting stronger
and harder films every time.</i>

71
00:05:20,044 --> 00:05:21,078
<i>There's clear evidence</i>

72
00:05:21,378 --> 00:05:23,047
<i>that these films are lowering
standards in society.</i>

73
00:05:23,214 --> 00:05:25,182
<i>And we should be afraid what
else they might do to people...</i>

74
00:05:25,282 --> 00:05:27,051
<i>With more
video recorders per person</i>

75
00:05:27,118 --> 00:05:28,853
<i>than any other country
in the world,</i>

76
00:05:28,986 --> 00:05:31,822
<i>Britain is the leader
of the video revolution.</i>

77
00:06:12,630 --> 00:06:14,131
This depiction
is dangerous.

78
00:06:14,265 --> 00:06:16,267
Come on, Enid.
No one's gonna pick this up

79
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,068
and think it's a documentary.
It's so fake.

80
00:06:18,202 --> 00:06:20,271
To you it might be sausages
for intestines,

81
00:06:20,404 --> 00:06:22,606
- but what if it gets into the hands of children?
- Exactly!

82
00:06:22,739 --> 00:06:25,276
Kids could be rewinding
and watching those scenes

83
00:06:25,342 --> 00:06:26,709
over and over again.

84
00:06:26,776 --> 00:06:28,479
Which is exactly
what new government guidelines

85
00:06:28,612 --> 00:06:29,613
are pointing at.

86
00:06:30,247 --> 00:06:31,949
- Video technology is changing the rules...
- More guidelines. Great.

87
00:06:31,949 --> 00:06:33,584
Not as if we haven't got enough
on our hands.

88
00:06:33,651 --> 00:06:34,919
How can we do
our job properly

89
00:06:35,085 --> 00:06:37,621
if we're constantly bogged down
by government bureaucracy?

90
00:06:37,754 --> 00:06:39,390
If it's the nation's sanity
they're worried about,

91
00:06:39,490 --> 00:06:40,424
why don't they stop slashing

92
00:06:40,690 --> 00:06:42,059
- social services?
- Okay, I get it.

93
00:06:42,193 --> 00:06:44,727
But I'm afraid we're not here
to debate the government.

94
00:06:44,828 --> 00:06:47,298
Can we get back on track,
please?

95
00:06:48,632 --> 00:06:51,202
Consensus on <i>Cannibal Carnage?</i>

96
00:06:51,302 --> 00:06:53,270
- Reject.
- I agree.

97
00:06:53,437 --> 00:06:54,805
A few cuts.

98
00:06:55,372 --> 00:06:56,773
I'd pass it.

99
00:06:59,577 --> 00:07:00,710
Enid.

100
00:07:03,514 --> 00:07:05,916
So, we're both
recommending reject?

101
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:07,017
Yes.

102
00:07:07,885 --> 00:07:10,787
Can I be a massive pain
and get you to type up my notes?

103
00:07:11,788 --> 00:07:13,657
Of course.
No problem, Anne.

104
00:07:13,790 --> 00:07:15,492
It's my sister's birthday.

105
00:07:15,626 --> 00:07:17,895
I should have been there
half an hour ago.

106
00:07:19,997 --> 00:07:21,365
Are you sure that's okay?

107
00:07:23,434 --> 00:07:24,668
You should go.

108
00:07:24,802 --> 00:07:26,337
Thanks, Enid.

109
00:07:26,470 --> 00:07:27,737
See you tomorrow.

110
00:08:09,046 --> 00:08:10,214
I can't believe
you did, though.

111
00:08:10,281 --> 00:08:11,982
- You are nuts.
- Oh my God!

112
00:08:12,049 --> 00:08:14,618
- Love you so much.
- Oh, I love you more.

113
00:08:28,565 --> 00:08:29,500
Excuse me!

114
00:08:34,338 --> 00:08:35,372
Sorry, excuse me!

115
00:08:39,410 --> 00:08:41,879
Er, sorry, I thought
you were someone else.

116
00:08:55,459 --> 00:08:57,995
<i>What we
have seen in this country</i>

117
00:08:58,128 --> 00:09:00,798
<i>is the emergence
of an organized</i>

118
00:09:00,864 --> 00:09:03,000
<i>revolutionary minority,</i>

119
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:07,104
<i>who are prepared
to exploit industrial disputes</i>

120
00:09:07,571 --> 00:09:09,239
<i>but whose real aim</i>

121
00:09:09,306 --> 00:09:11,875
<i>is the breakdown
of law and order</i>

122
00:09:12,009 --> 00:09:14,044
<i>and the destruction
of democratic</i>

123
00:09:14,111 --> 00:09:15,814
<i>parliamentary government.</i>

124
00:09:19,283 --> 00:09:21,318
<i>The gas industry's main unions</i>

125

<i>that they will delay

00:09:31,261 --> 00:09:33,263
<i>...were set to take place

129
00:09:33,364 --> 00:09:35,499
<i>which have now been postponed

130
00:09:37,601 --> 00:09:39,470
<i>This is Enid Baines.</i>

131
00:09:39,536 --> 00:09:40,738
<i>Please leave a message.</i>

132
00:09:42,807 --> 00:09:45,409
<i>Hi Enid. It's Mom.</i>

133
00:09:45,976 --> 00:09:48,412
<i>Oh, I don't like talking
to these things.</i>

134
00:09:48,979 --> 00:09:51,315
<i>Well, if you're there,
Dad and I booked the table</i>

135
00:09:51,382 --> 00:09:52,616
<i>for 9 p.m.</i>

136
00:09:53,083 --> 00:09:55,285
<i>It's at the restaurant
that Dad mentioned.</i>

137
00:09:55,919 --> 00:09:58,322
<i>Er, see you there, love. Bye.</i>

138
00:10:06,730 --> 00:10:08,465
The food here is meant
to be good.

139
00:10:08,599 --> 00:10:10,000
Mm.

140
00:10:12,736 --> 00:10:14,405
This is a death certificate.

141
00:10:15,072 --> 00:10:16,540
Ready to order?

142
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:21,412
Maybe we need another minute.

143
00:10:23,914 --> 00:10:25,449
Have they found something?

144
00:10:25,582 --> 00:10:26,917
No, Enid.

145
00:10:27,484 --> 00:10:29,219
We just felt...

146
00:10:31,288 --> 00:10:32,523
What's going on?

147
00:10:34,358 --> 00:10:35,959
Your Dad and I
have been thinking about this

148
00:10:36,026 --> 00:10:37,327
for a long time.

149
00:10:38,262 --> 00:10:40,197
It hasn't been an easy decision.

150
00:10:40,899 --> 00:10:42,332
Enid, I know it's difficult,

151
00:10:42,466 --> 00:10:44,501
but we need to find
a way to let go.

152
00:10:45,904 --> 00:10:46,838
Let go?

153
00:10:47,337 --> 00:10:49,540
Try to find
some sort of peace?

154
00:10:51,408 --> 00:10:54,011
Your Dad and I aren't
going to be around forever

155
00:10:54,144 --> 00:10:55,814
and I don't want
to grow old wishing

156
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:56,815
for a happy ending

157
00:10:56,881 --> 00:10:58,982
that we all know
might never come.

158
00:11:00,417 --> 00:11:03,287
So, are you deciding
that she's dead?

159
00:11:08,827 --> 00:11:10,994
But this marks her death
as that day.

160
00:11:12,129 --> 00:11:13,530
I was there.
I would know if she died.

161
00:11:13,597 --> 00:11:17,267
You've never been clear
on exactly what you remember.

162
00:11:18,335 --> 00:11:20,437
I can try and remember, Mom.
Is that what you want me to do?

163
00:11:20,504 --> 00:11:22,105
- I can, you know...
- Enid, we've done that.

164
00:11:22,172 --> 00:11:23,507
That's the point.

165
00:11:24,274 --> 00:11:25,275
We'll never know what happened.

166
00:11:25,409 --> 00:11:26,845
Yeah, so she's still missing.

167
00:11:26,977 --> 00:11:30,481
Enid, if we were going to...

168
00:11:31,181 --> 00:11:32,382
we should have found her by now.

169
00:11:32,516 --> 00:11:35,686
You know if someone
did take her, then...

170
00:11:36,821 --> 00:11:38,455
then they're still out there.

171
00:11:41,826 --> 00:11:42,993
Enid.

172
00:11:46,363 --> 00:11:47,397
Sorry.

173
00:11:50,033 --> 00:11:51,568
We're not blaming you.

174
00:11:53,136 --> 00:11:56,273
Mom and I are only trying to do
what's best, love.

175
00:11:56,406 --> 00:11:59,076
It's the right decision
for all of us, Enid.

176
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:01,278
Please?

177
00:12:13,223 --> 00:12:15,425
No,
that's a copy for you to keep.

178
00:12:19,730 --> 00:12:21,565
Patrick recommended

179
00:12:21,632 --> 00:12:22,666
the fish.

180
00:12:23,534 --> 00:12:25,135
Viv said they had
a lovely time here.

181
00:12:25,269 --> 00:12:26,770
Mm.

182
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:31,141
So, how's work, Enid?

183
00:12:31,809 --> 00:12:33,577
Seen anything you'd recommend?

184
00:12:35,847 --> 00:12:37,447
It's not entertainment, Mom.

185
00:12:38,883 --> 00:12:40,651
I do it to protect people.

186
00:12:40,784 --> 00:12:41,618
Yes, of course. Well,

187
00:12:41,718 --> 00:12:44,721
let's all just try
to have a lovely meal.

188
00:12:44,856 --> 00:12:46,256
Shall we?

189
00:14:14,745 --> 00:14:16,546
- It's always the same with you.
- What?

190
00:14:16,647 --> 00:14:18,148
You know,
taking no responsibility.

191
00:14:18,215 --> 00:14:19,750
I never take responsibility?

192
00:14:19,817 --> 00:14:20,717
What, you lose your fucking job

193
00:14:20,885 --> 00:14:22,552
and I'm the one that
doesn't take responsibility?

194
00:14:22,686 --> 00:14:24,388
I've had
enough of this shit!

195
00:14:24,521 --> 00:14:25,555
Fucking kid to feed.

196
00:14:25,722 --> 00:14:27,290
Don't be bringing him into it.

197
00:14:27,357 --> 00:14:29,192
It's fucking typical.

198
00:14:56,154 --> 00:14:57,220
Late night?

199
00:14:57,354 --> 00:14:59,123
One too many white wines.

200
00:14:59,256 --> 00:15:02,492
Well, let's hope there's nothing
too stomach churning coming up then.

201
00:15:04,361 --> 00:15:06,463
What masterpiece
are we dissecting?

202
00:15:06,596 --> 00:15:08,298
<i>Extreme Coda.</i>

203
00:15:36,393 --> 00:15:38,395
I mean, what is it
with these directors?

204
00:15:38,528 --> 00:15:41,264
Male inadequacy
revenge catharsis.

205
00:15:45,235 --> 00:15:46,804
Didn't that get to you?

206
00:15:47,604 --> 00:15:49,974
Some of those scenes
were so excessive.

207
00:15:50,108 --> 00:15:51,775
Just focus on getting it right.

208
00:15:53,077 --> 00:15:54,879
Don't really think
about anything else.

209
00:15:59,884 --> 00:16:01,251
Plus, I haven't got a hangover.

210
00:16:02,619 --> 00:16:05,857
Enid, Fraser wants to see us.
Says it's urgent.

211
00:16:23,908 --> 00:16:25,575
Shut the door.

212
00:16:34,986 --> 00:16:37,554
You two passed <i>Deranged,</i>
right?

213
00:16:38,256 --> 00:16:40,858
- <i>Deranged?</i>
- Yes. The Moreno film.

214
00:16:41,458 --> 00:16:44,394
We watched it
a few months ago. Why?

215
00:16:45,062 --> 00:16:49,834
There's a, a sequence in it
where a man eats someone's face.

216
00:16:50,234 --> 00:16:54,571
- Oh, yes.
- Yes. 18 with extensive cuts.

217
00:16:56,306 --> 00:16:57,909
What's happened, Fraser?

218
00:16:59,676 --> 00:17:03,080
A man that was arrested
in Brighouse yesterday.

219
00:17:03,214 --> 00:17:04,849
He, er...

220
00:17:05,615 --> 00:17:07,517
killed his wife, then he,...

221
00:17:08,318 --> 00:17:10,254
then he tore off
and ate her face.

222
00:17:10,955 --> 00:17:14,992
W... went on to shoot
his two children, dead.

223
00:17:15,725 --> 00:17:16,793
It's horrific.

224
00:17:17,295 --> 00:17:19,396
I got a call from some

225
00:17:19,596 --> 00:17:21,999
journalist 15 minutes ago
who was breaking the story.

226
00:17:23,835 --> 00:17:26,304
He's linking the killings
directly to <i>Deranged.</i>

227
00:17:26,503 --> 00:17:29,339
Oh God! So, they're blaming us?

228
00:17:29,506 --> 00:17:31,508
Well, there's the thing.

229
00:17:32,143 --> 00:17:34,245
This journalist seemed to know
that it was you two

230
00:17:34,312 --> 00:17:35,980
who passed the film.

231
00:17:36,147 --> 00:17:37,380
How the hell do they know that?

232
00:17:37,514 --> 00:17:39,482
I can't believe you two
let it get past you.

233
00:17:39,616 --> 00:17:41,618
It's complete hysteria.

234
00:17:41,986 --> 00:17:44,454
It's no worse than other
material we've passed.

235
00:17:44,588 --> 00:17:46,356
The press
are going to town

236
00:17:46,489 --> 00:17:48,725
calling him
the 'Amnesiac Killer'.

237
00:17:50,328 --> 00:17:53,331
He's saying he can't remember
what happened.

238
00:17:54,065 --> 00:17:56,033
Government policy's
already breathing down

239
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:57,667
our necks without this.

240
00:17:58,368 --> 00:17:59,603
It's a complete disaster.

241
00:17:59,736 --> 00:18:01,172
I mean, I can't believe
you'd go off

242
00:18:01,272 --> 00:18:03,540
like that without permission,
either of you...

243
00:18:05,142 --> 00:18:07,711
Why did you
leave her in the forest?

244
00:18:12,449 --> 00:18:14,085
Enid, how?

245
00:18:14,718 --> 00:18:15,853
Sorry.

246
00:18:17,955 --> 00:18:19,090
I'm so sorry.

247
00:18:22,159 --> 00:18:25,695
I need you to walk me
through your decisions again.

248
00:18:26,030 --> 00:18:28,565
So, I'm 100% clear.

249
00:18:28,698 --> 00:18:31,401
And for the record, in future,

250
00:18:31,534 --> 00:18:33,905
if you have even
the slightest doubt...

251
00:18:34,571 --> 00:18:36,506
just reject the film.

252
00:18:38,575 --> 00:18:40,410
<i>The man,
who went berserk</i>

253
00:18:40,543 --> 00:18:43,314
<i>claims he cannot recall
the incident at all.</i>

254
00:18:43,446 --> 00:18:45,349
<i>The accused
has been dubbed by press</i>

255
00:18:45,415 --> 00:18:46,951
<i>as 'The Amnesiac Killer'</i>

256
00:18:47,084 --> 00:18:49,653
<i>after links being made today
between the killing</i>

257
00:18:49,786 --> 00:18:53,090
<i>and video nasty horror film,</i>
Deranged.

258
00:18:53,224 --> 00:18:55,492
<i>I heard
the most awful scream.</i>

259
00:18:55,993 --> 00:18:57,661
<i>Made my blood go cold.</i>

260
00:18:57,794 --> 00:19:00,131
<i>And now they're saying
it's because of some film.</i>

261
00:19:00,865 --> 00:19:02,565
<i>Looks like the world's
gone mad.</i>

262
00:19:02,699 --> 00:19:04,168
<i>This has always been
a really safe neighborhood,</i>

263
00:19:04,335 --> 00:19:07,872
<i>like, for the kids and that. For everyone...</i>

264
00:19:08,538 --> 00:19:11,008
<i>A hotel
in Painswick has been cleared</i>

265
00:19:11,075 --> 00:19:12,376
<i>of staff and guests</i>

266
00:19:12,509 --> 00:19:14,477
<i>after police found

267
00:19:14,611 --> 00:19:16,613
<i>hidden in one
of the hotel's rooms.</i>

268
00:19:17,048 --> 00:19:19,317
- Mom?
- <i>Despicable woman.</i>

269
00:19:19,449 --> 00:19:21,518
<i>Letting people see
that disgusting film,</i>

270
00:19:21,651 --> 00:19:23,586
<i>you should be
ashamed of yourself.</i>

271
00:19:36,067 --> 00:19:37,301
Enid!

272
00:19:37,435 --> 00:19:38,803
Where is she?

273
00:19:40,871 --> 00:19:41,906
Enid!

274
00:19:43,274 --> 00:19:47,111
No! No!

275
00:20:07,465 --> 00:20:08,798
Oi, watch it, mate!

276
00:20:08,866 --> 00:20:10,201
- Miss Baines!
- Enid,

277
00:20:10,267 --> 00:20:11,668
why did you allow
<i>Deranged</i> to be released?

278
00:20:11,869 --> 00:20:13,270
Do you feel
you have blood on your hands?

279
00:20:13,337 --> 00:20:14,972
Is the Amnesiac
Killer telling the truth?

280
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:16,874
Why aren't
you banning these films?

281
00:20:46,536 --> 00:20:48,239
Come in.

282
00:20:49,672 --> 00:20:52,143
Fraser,
you sly old bastard.

283
00:20:52,276 --> 00:20:53,344
Doug, hi. Come in.

284
00:21:04,989 --> 00:21:07,557
I mean,
my kids are reading this.

285
00:21:07,690 --> 00:21:09,160
How the fuck do they know
who passed it?

286
00:21:09,293 --> 00:21:11,661
- You think she blabbed to the press?
- Oh, yeah.

287
00:21:11,795 --> 00:21:14,231
It's not even
like we're paid that much.

288
00:21:14,365 --> 00:21:16,800
I could go to academia
like that.

289
00:21:16,934 --> 00:21:20,603
Seriously. And that,
that scene is laughable!

290
00:21:20,737 --> 00:21:22,406
Even Little-Miss-Perfect
thought it was funny.

291
00:21:25,509 --> 00:21:26,776
Enid.

292
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:34,717
Bad luck, isn't it?

293
00:21:35,618 --> 00:21:37,720
I mean, it could have happened
to any of us.

294
00:21:39,356 --> 00:21:43,227
If I'm here to make decisions
it can't be 'bad luck'.

295
00:21:45,529 --> 00:21:47,832
No. But, well,

296
00:21:48,332 --> 00:21:49,632
you know what I mean.

297
00:21:50,234 --> 00:21:51,601
We all make mistakes.

298
00:22:03,447 --> 00:22:05,816
<i>Nina, spin.</i>

299
00:22:06,283 --> 00:22:10,653
<i>One, two, three.</i>

300
00:22:13,690 --> 00:22:15,092
That's a single malt now,
Fraser.

301
00:22:15,226 --> 00:22:17,428
- Don't be using that to drown your sorrows.
- Er, yeah.

302
00:22:21,098 --> 00:22:22,933
And who's this
you've got squirreled away?

303
00:22:23,067 --> 00:22:26,137
Er, this is Enid Baines.
She's one of our censors.

304
00:22:26,270 --> 00:22:27,704
So, this is Enid.

305
00:22:28,305 --> 00:22:30,141
- Have we met?
- No.

306
00:22:31,741 --> 00:22:35,846
Doug Smart. Producer,
Ident Investment Films.

307
00:22:40,451 --> 00:22:43,720
Fraser, you didn't tell me
you had such a photogenic team.

308
00:22:44,687 --> 00:22:46,323
Now tell me this Enid,
if you get bored

309
00:22:46,390 --> 00:22:47,657
of banning my films,

310
00:22:47,790 --> 00:22:50,327
I'm sure I could get you a job
on the big screen.

311
00:22:50,861 --> 00:22:53,663
I'm not sure how much
I like the idea of being raped

312
00:22:53,796 --> 00:22:55,466
and cut into pieces on camera.

313
00:22:57,168 --> 00:23:00,070
No, but I'm sure
the public would love it.

314
00:23:00,571 --> 00:23:01,771
Okay, Doug, come on.

315
00:23:01,906 --> 00:23:03,673
Maybe Enid could, er,

316
00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:06,610
watch my latest
Frederick North submission?

317
00:23:07,178 --> 00:23:09,580
It's from the archives.
It's harmless, I promise.

318
00:23:09,980 --> 00:23:12,917
I, er...
I'm sure you could slip me a 15.

319
00:23:13,683 --> 00:23:15,718
It's, er,
already on her schedule.

320
00:23:15,853 --> 00:23:17,421
And I'm sure
she'll deal with it

321
00:23:17,488 --> 00:23:18,788
with her usual professionalism.

322
00:23:18,923 --> 00:23:21,258
Right, come on, Doug.
Let me see you out.

323
00:23:22,293 --> 00:23:23,827
<i>Enchante, mademoiselle.</i>

324
00:23:26,030 --> 00:23:29,567
What a wee cracker she is.
Absolutely gorgeous.

325
00:23:36,140 --> 00:23:37,942
There were
so many shits and fucks,

326
00:23:38,075 --> 00:23:39,577
it was impossible
to cut them all,

327
00:23:39,709 --> 00:23:42,213
so we just had to give it a 15.

328
00:23:43,314 --> 00:23:44,481
Anyway...

329
00:23:45,883 --> 00:23:47,384
- Thank you, Alf.
- All right.

330
00:23:47,518 --> 00:23:49,353
What have we got now then?

331
00:23:49,486 --> 00:23:50,921
<i>Don't Go In The Church.</i>

332
00:23:51,055 --> 00:23:53,357
There won't be many places
left for us to go soon.

333
00:23:56,293 --> 00:23:57,760
Frederick North film.

334
00:23:58,229 --> 00:24:00,331
Haven't seen
one of his in a while.

335
00:24:00,464 --> 00:24:02,266
Used to be quite prolific.

336
00:24:02,399 --> 00:24:03,500
Don't think I know his work.

337
00:24:03,634 --> 00:24:05,903
Oh, he's a laugh a minute.

338
00:24:22,286 --> 00:24:24,121
Oh, silent titles.

339
00:24:25,022 --> 00:24:26,257
Unusual.

340
00:24:33,330 --> 00:24:34,298
<i>This way.</i>

341
00:24:34,932 --> 00:24:36,367
<i>Please stop.</i>

342
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:39,103
<i>I don't like it.
Can we go back?</i>

343
00:24:39,769 --> 00:24:41,472
<i>No, it'll be fun.</i>

344
00:24:47,244 --> 00:24:48,946
<i>Let's play a game.</i>

345
00:25:00,824 --> 00:25:02,226
<i>Come on.</i>

346
00:25:02,693 --> 00:25:04,328
<i>Summon my shadow.</i>

347
00:25:05,195 --> 00:25:06,263
<i>Spin.</i>

348
00:25:12,403 --> 00:25:13,570
<i>Do it!</i>

349
00:25:17,775 --> 00:25:19,209
<i>One...</i>

350
00:25:21,145 --> 00:25:23,113
<i>Two...</i>

351
00:25:25,182 --> 00:25:27,017
<i>Three...</i>

352
00:25:32,056 --> 00:25:33,257
<i>Go on.</i>

353
00:25:35,292 --> 00:25:36,460
<i>In there.</i>

354
00:25:38,262 --> 00:25:39,263
<i>Go!</i>

355
00:27:42,653 --> 00:27:44,121
You okay?

356
00:27:44,823 --> 00:27:46,390
It was quite full on.

357
00:27:47,558 --> 00:27:48,959
It shook me up.

358
00:27:49,092 --> 00:27:50,727
Just feeling a bit
under the weather.

359
00:27:51,930 --> 00:27:54,264
You know you can always talk
to me, don't you?

360
00:27:55,365 --> 00:27:56,633
If you want to.

361
00:27:57,468 --> 00:27:58,769
Stressful times.

362
00:27:59,236 --> 00:28:01,672
Like when my mom passed away,

363
00:28:01,738 --> 00:28:03,040
if I hadn't had
someone to talk to

364
00:28:03,106 --> 00:28:05,042
I think I might of just...

365
00:28:05,742 --> 00:28:07,077
I don't know,

366
00:28:07,211 --> 00:28:09,313
- lost it...
- Why do you think he can't remember?

367
00:28:11,248 --> 00:28:12,616
Er, who?

368
00:28:14,985 --> 00:28:17,020
The Amnesiac Killer.

369
00:28:17,956 --> 00:28:20,524
Oh, I... I don't know.

370
00:28:23,794 --> 00:28:25,562
I mean,
why wouldn't he remember?

371
00:28:28,532 --> 00:28:30,133
God, it's hard to...

372
00:28:31,702 --> 00:28:33,270
Could be basic trauma.

373
00:28:33,403 --> 00:28:36,206
Brain sort of shuts it out.

374
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:39,710
Could have had a bang
on the head even. Or...

375
00:28:41,311 --> 00:28:43,780
It makes me think
of my psychotherapy days

376
00:28:43,915 --> 00:28:45,749
we'd talk about
how people construct

377
00:28:45,817 --> 00:28:47,718
stories to cope.

378
00:28:48,619 --> 00:28:50,654
You'd be surprised
what the human brain

379
00:28:50,721 --> 00:28:53,524
can edit out
when it can't handle the truth.

380
00:28:56,527 --> 00:28:58,028
Look.

381
00:28:58,997 --> 00:29:00,764
You're good at your job, Enid.

382
00:29:01,265 --> 00:29:03,600
Don't let what's going on
out there get to you.

383
00:29:06,670 --> 00:29:09,706
I don't know if you want to
but maybe we could get out

384
00:29:09,773 --> 00:29:10,808
of here sometime?

385
00:29:12,042 --> 00:29:13,544
Go for a drink.

386
00:29:20,284 --> 00:29:22,753
I'm so sorry about your mom,
Perkins.

387
00:29:25,756 --> 00:29:27,224
Thank you for this.

388
00:29:55,019 --> 00:29:56,219
Hello?

389
00:30:08,866 --> 00:30:09,834
Hello?

390
00:30:40,764 --> 00:30:42,366
<i>Hello?</i>

391
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:44,801
Hi, Mom.

392
00:30:45,937 --> 00:30:50,273
<i>Oh, Enid. Are you okay?</i>

393
00:30:51,475 --> 00:30:53,377
<i>I've been trying
to get hold of you.</i>

394
00:30:54,012 --> 00:30:56,213
Sorry. Work's been...

395
00:30:58,615 --> 00:31:00,317
really busy.

396
00:31:00,985 --> 00:31:02,753
<i>Oh, okay.</i>

397
00:31:03,353 --> 00:31:05,222
<i>Well, I hope
you're all right, love.</i>

398
00:31:10,494 --> 00:31:12,229
<i>Are you still there, love?</i>

399
00:31:14,899 --> 00:31:15,833
Yes.

400
00:31:21,238 --> 00:31:22,539
It's, um...

401
00:31:25,275 --> 00:31:27,611
I examined this film today.

402
00:31:29,546 --> 00:31:32,449
<i>Oh. What was it about?</i>

403
00:31:41,859 --> 00:31:42,927
Nothing.

404
00:31:44,628 --> 00:31:45,696
It doesn't matter.

405
00:31:49,433 --> 00:31:54,404
<i>You... you mustn't
let work get you down, Enid.</i>

406
00:31:55,139 --> 00:31:56,273
<i>I saw the news.</i>

407
00:31:56,740 --> 00:31:58,375
- <i>It's only 'cause your Dad...</i>
- Dad doesn't know

408
00:31:58,442 --> 00:31:59,576
what he's talking about.

409
00:31:59,643 --> 00:32:01,712
- <i>All right, love.</i>
- I'm sorry.

410
00:32:05,049 --> 00:32:06,416
Just tired.

411
00:32:08,218 --> 00:32:10,253
<i>Well, don't overdo it,
will you?</i>

412
00:32:11,755 --> 00:32:14,291
<i>You can't be responsible
for everyone, Enid.</i>

413
00:32:15,026 --> 00:32:16,693
<i>It's just a job.</i>

414
00:32:17,260 --> 00:32:18,963
Yeah. I suppose so.

415
00:34:08,072 --> 00:34:09,673
Nina?

416
00:34:16,346 --> 00:34:17,849
Nina?

417
00:35:12,937 --> 00:35:14,005
Mom?

418
00:35:26,017 --> 00:35:28,485
It's all your fault!

419
00:35:47,838 --> 00:35:48,806
Valerie.

420
00:35:49,173 --> 00:35:50,774
Hang on.

421
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:57,181
What is it?

422
00:35:57,315 --> 00:35:59,183
Um, Perkins and I examined

423
00:35:59,250 --> 00:36:01,551
<i>Don't Go In The Church</i>
yesterday.

424
00:36:01,886 --> 00:36:04,055
Well, the file's a bit thin
on information.

425
00:36:05,022 --> 00:36:06,489
I was wondering
if you had anything else

426
00:36:06,556 --> 00:36:07,724
on the director.

427
00:36:09,093 --> 00:36:10,560
It's Frederick North.

428
00:36:14,597 --> 00:36:17,534
Do you have a list of his films?

429
00:36:20,037 --> 00:36:20,972
No.

430
00:36:22,706 --> 00:36:25,843
Well, without a list,
it'll take at least a week.

431
00:36:40,790 --> 00:36:43,593
Leaving on time, Enid?
It's not like you.

432
00:37:02,612 --> 00:37:04,815
Beastman's coming to get you!

433
00:37:31,375 --> 00:37:33,210
Oh, hi.

434
00:37:33,344 --> 00:37:34,744
Er, enjoy it?

435
00:37:34,879 --> 00:37:36,047
Yeah, proper gory.

436
00:37:36,180 --> 00:37:39,083
It's good, isn't it?
See you next time.

437
00:37:39,216 --> 00:37:40,251
Cheers, Gerald.

438
00:37:56,500 --> 00:37:58,836
- Hey.
- I thought that one was banned.

439
00:38:00,905 --> 00:38:02,940
Um, I don't know what you mean.

440
00:38:04,741 --> 00:38:06,776
Maybe you can help me?
I was looking for

441
00:38:07,211 --> 00:38:08,879
some of the more unusual

442
00:38:09,380 --> 00:38:11,215
Frederick North films?

443
00:38:13,716 --> 00:38:15,252
I've seen, um...

444
00:38:16,586 --> 00:38:18,155
<i>Don't Go In The Church.</i>

445
00:38:18,289 --> 00:38:19,223
Oh.

446
00:38:19,423 --> 00:38:22,526
Perhaps maybe you might have
something else of his

447
00:38:22,625 --> 00:38:24,128
under the counter.

448
00:38:26,763 --> 00:38:31,302
Um... I've not seen you
in here before.

449
00:38:33,404 --> 00:38:35,139
Just moved to the area.

450
00:38:35,772 --> 00:38:38,075
Someone like you doesn't
want to watch films like that.

451
00:38:40,311 --> 00:38:41,611
Like what?

452
00:38:45,449 --> 00:38:47,818
My favorite is,
er, <i>Stationery Massacre.</i>

453
00:38:48,285 --> 00:38:50,653
The repeated stabbing
of the man's eye with a compass

454
00:38:50,787 --> 00:38:52,689
then his stomach
being ripped open

455
00:38:52,755 --> 00:38:54,825
with serrated scissors.

456
00:38:54,992 --> 00:38:56,626
His guts falling out, his,
his stomach

457
00:38:56,693 --> 00:38:58,195
being stapled back together.

458
00:39:00,297 --> 00:39:01,664
Masterpiece.

459
00:39:08,272 --> 00:39:10,107
All right, come on.
I've seen, I've seen

460
00:39:10,174 --> 00:39:12,543
that you've got
<i>Cannibal Carnage.</i>

461
00:39:12,675 --> 00:39:14,812
And I know that
that's been banned.

462
00:39:16,746 --> 00:39:18,282
Bloody hell.

463
00:39:19,083 --> 00:39:20,050
Okay.

464
00:39:20,951 --> 00:39:23,287
So many places getting,
you know, shut down.

465
00:39:23,420 --> 00:39:24,488
Police raids and...

466
00:39:24,622 --> 00:39:26,624
My mate up town
had his lot confiscated.

467
00:39:27,992 --> 00:39:30,727
Honestly, it's not worth
the bloody stress.

468
00:39:35,332 --> 00:39:38,035
Gonna get rid of it
all soon myself anyway. So...

469
00:39:40,004 --> 00:39:41,771
That's all I've got of North's.

470
00:39:41,839 --> 00:39:43,007
It's a bit of a ropey copy.

471
00:39:43,073 --> 00:39:44,741
Might be a bit fuzzy
in all the good bits.

472
00:39:44,875 --> 00:39:47,344
And, er, well, someone's
taped over the end

473
00:39:47,411 --> 00:39:48,913
with another film.

474
00:39:52,749 --> 00:39:54,818
<i>This place gives me
a bad feeling.</i>

475
00:39:55,286 --> 00:39:57,955
<i>It's like something
from one of my nightmares.</i>

476
00:39:58,088 --> 00:39:58,889
<i>Let's go back.</i>

477
00:39:59,089 --> 00:40:01,825
<i>No, we've come too far
to turn back.</i>

478
00:40:04,461 --> 00:40:05,629
<i>Strange.</i>

479
00:40:06,063 --> 00:40:08,232
- <i>What is it?</i>
- <i>A book.</i>

480
00:40:08,899 --> 00:40:10,534
<i>There's a symbol.</i>

481
00:40:10,767 --> 00:40:12,536
<i>It's like some sort of portal.</i>

482
00:40:12,670 --> 00:40:15,172
<i>Wait, let me see.</i>

483
00:40:19,109 --> 00:40:20,211
<i>It's Latin.</i>

484
00:40:20,945 --> 00:40:22,446
<i>I can work it out.</i>

485
00:40:23,113 --> 00:40:25,616
"Si introibunt

486
00:40:25,683 --> 00:40:28,419
hoc sepulcrum, dare

487
00:40:28,485 --> 00:40:30,321
tibi ad infernum..."

488
00:40:30,487 --> 00:40:32,156
<i>Tom. Stop!</i>

489
00:40:33,257 --> 00:40:34,825
<i>It could be dangerous.</i>

490
00:40:35,226 --> 00:40:38,862
"Qui este cunum
quam reverterto."

491
00:40:39,196 --> 00:40:43,267
"Quis hog momento
insemperternum."

492
00:40:44,401 --> 00:40:48,072
"Imutata sinsintuar."

493
00:40:49,807 --> 00:40:51,909
<i>He's calling for me.</i>

494
00:41:00,884 --> 00:41:02,486
"Sinsintuar."

495
00:41:05,422 --> 00:41:07,157
<i>He's calling for me.</i>

496
00:41:08,392 --> 00:41:10,427
<i>The evil is contagious.</i>

497
00:41:16,567 --> 00:41:18,435
<i>He's calling for me.</i>

498
00:41:19,703 --> 00:41:21,338
<i>The evil is contagious.</i>

499
00:42:46,323 --> 00:42:49,159
We definitely
had some Jaffa cakes.

500
00:42:49,493 --> 00:42:50,994
Sorry, I should have phoned.

501
00:42:51,161 --> 00:42:53,530
Oh, where do things end up?

502
00:42:55,265 --> 00:42:57,167
I should have got more bits in.

503
00:43:06,377 --> 00:43:08,612
Do you remember
Carol and Alan, Enid?

504
00:43:09,613 --> 00:43:10,514
Hm.

505
00:43:10,647 --> 00:43:12,449
Alan, with the squinty eye.

506
00:43:13,317 --> 00:43:14,651
They broke up.

507
00:43:14,853 --> 00:43:16,487
Such a shame.

508
00:43:17,388 --> 00:43:19,757
Carol's moving
near the seaside now.

509
00:43:20,057 --> 00:43:21,558
I suppose
she's better off out of it

510
00:43:21,625 --> 00:43:22,893
but I'm going to miss her.

511
00:43:23,026 --> 00:43:24,495
You can visit, love.

512
00:43:33,303 --> 00:43:35,439
I wanted to talk to you
about something.

513
00:43:36,340 --> 00:43:38,575
- Found a nice fella?
- No.

514
00:43:44,982 --> 00:43:46,950
It's to do with Nina.

515
00:43:49,319 --> 00:43:52,891
I know what we talked about
and I understand,

516
00:43:53,524 --> 00:43:54,691
but think I...

517
00:43:55,159 --> 00:43:57,961
I think I might have worked out
where she is.

518
00:43:58,996 --> 00:44:01,398
Oh, please, Enid.
Not this again.

519
00:44:02,466 --> 00:44:04,968
I know, Dad,
but this is different.

520
00:44:06,203 --> 00:44:07,938
There's this actress.

521
00:44:09,006 --> 00:44:10,941
Her name is Alice Lee.

522
00:44:13,277 --> 00:44:17,281
I know it sounds mad,
but I've got this...

523
00:44:18,081 --> 00:44:20,184
I've got
this really strong feeling

524
00:44:20,250 --> 00:44:21,652
that I think it's her.

525
00:44:24,755 --> 00:44:28,158
I need you to look at this.
Just focus on her face.

526
00:44:28,959 --> 00:44:31,228
Just look at her eyes.

527
00:44:32,463 --> 00:44:35,632
We've been here before,
Enid. Every time it's not her.

528
00:44:36,099 --> 00:44:37,601
Dad, please!
You're not even looking at her.

529
00:44:37,668 --> 00:44:39,203
Please! Just look.

530
00:44:40,204 --> 00:44:42,539
She looks just like
the police mock-up, Dad.

531
00:44:42,874 --> 00:44:44,341
Enid, stop!

532
00:44:44,843 --> 00:44:46,343
- Dad.
- Enid.

533
00:44:46,577 --> 00:44:49,213
This is exactly
why we did what we did.

534
00:44:49,346 --> 00:44:50,815
We tried to do our best for you,

535
00:44:50,882 --> 00:44:52,616
but you go off
doing whatever you want.

536
00:44:53,016 --> 00:44:54,551
Just like the day
you went off with her!

537
00:44:54,618 --> 00:44:55,719
George!

538
00:47:32,877 --> 00:47:34,645
No, Nina!

539
00:47:36,014 --> 00:47:38,816
No!

540
00:50:01,959 --> 00:50:03,293
Doug.

541
00:50:06,230 --> 00:50:07,798
I was in the area.

542
00:50:13,303 --> 00:50:15,006
We met at the censor's office.

543
00:50:17,208 --> 00:50:18,976
Of course. Enid.

544
00:50:20,244 --> 00:50:21,578
Um...

545
00:50:22,445 --> 00:50:24,182
Sorry, I've been having
a bit of bother.

546
00:50:24,314 --> 00:50:28,585
Um, some people don't seem
to like my films.

547
00:50:36,027 --> 00:50:37,327
Do come in.

548
00:50:46,904 --> 00:50:48,371
Through here.

549
00:50:57,014 --> 00:50:58,615
Do you live alone?

550
00:51:01,785 --> 00:51:03,787
Yes. I live alone.

551
00:51:13,030 --> 00:51:14,698
This room seems familiar.

552
00:51:16,033 --> 00:51:17,101
Must be a sign.

553
00:51:18,836 --> 00:51:21,906
It's the rape scene
from <i>Extreme Coda.</i>

554
00:51:24,041 --> 00:51:25,843
Someone's got a keen eye.

555
00:51:32,250 --> 00:51:34,384
I got this for Coda in LA.

556
00:51:37,822 --> 00:51:39,789
Go to the States
quite a bit actually.

557
00:51:48,431 --> 00:51:49,967
We look similar, don't we?

558
00:51:51,035 --> 00:51:51,936
Who?

559
00:51:52,469 --> 00:51:53,804
Me and Alice Lee.

560
00:52:00,378 --> 00:52:01,578
You do actually.

561
00:52:01,711 --> 00:52:03,780
I knew
you reminded me of someone.

562
00:52:04,614 --> 00:52:07,051
Why don't we get
this wet coat off?

563
00:52:12,957 --> 00:52:14,724
What's Frederick like?

564
00:52:14,859 --> 00:52:16,459
What can I say?

565
00:52:17,460 --> 00:52:20,932
He's a provocateur and a genius.

566
00:52:22,099 --> 00:52:23,733
He's widely misunderstood.

567
00:52:26,736 --> 00:52:28,906
You enjoyed <i>Don't Go In
The Church</i> then, huh?

568
00:52:30,841 --> 00:52:33,044
Frederick pressed
for you to view it.

569
00:52:34,378 --> 00:52:36,646
Wanted a woman's eye
on his film.

570
00:52:39,116 --> 00:52:40,650
You not enjoying your scotch?

571
00:52:52,595 --> 00:52:54,497
You might be interested to hear
that he's shooting

572
00:52:54,564 --> 00:52:57,068
a juicy sequel
to Church at the moment,

573
00:52:57,667 --> 00:53:00,037
with the monstrous 'Beastman'.

574
00:53:01,372 --> 00:53:03,174
Sequels are all the rage
these days.

575
00:53:07,345 --> 00:53:08,846
Where are they filming it?

576
00:53:10,513 --> 00:53:11,849
Near Frederick's.

577
00:53:11,983 --> 00:53:14,018
In the forest
where we shot the original.

578
00:53:15,319 --> 00:53:16,954
And Alice Lee's in it?

579
00:53:17,088 --> 00:53:18,488
It'll be her last film.

580
00:53:19,256 --> 00:53:21,758
She's come to the end
of her shelf life, that one.

581
00:53:22,326 --> 00:53:24,061
W... what does that mean?

582
00:53:29,233 --> 00:53:33,437
Let's not talk
about some silly actress.

583
00:53:34,205 --> 00:53:37,475
Far more interested in talking
about you, Enid.

584
00:53:37,640 --> 00:53:39,377
What's going to happen to Alice?

585
00:53:39,509 --> 00:53:41,045
Well, that's top secret.

586
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:44,215
Frederick abducted her,
didn't he?

587
00:53:44,514 --> 00:53:45,648
I can abduct you if you want.

588
00:53:45,782 --> 00:53:47,852
- Stop! Get off me.
- What?

589
00:53:48,518 --> 00:53:50,054
- Came round my house.
- Let go of me.

590
00:53:50,121 --> 00:53:52,823
- You fucking prick tease.
- Just let go of me, please!

591
00:53:53,224 --> 00:53:54,524
- Stop.
- Get...

592
00:53:54,657 --> 00:53:56,427
Stop!
Please stop!

593
00:53:56,526 --> 00:53:58,295
Just let go of me!

594
00:54:47,744 --> 00:54:49,779
Thank you for the whiskey.

595
00:54:51,148 --> 00:54:52,817
I'll see myself out.

596
00:55:26,951 --> 00:55:27,985
<i>You fucking sick bitch.</i>

597
00:55:28,119 --> 00:55:29,652
<i>I hope you get
what's coming to you.</i>

598
00:55:29,786 --> 00:55:32,622
<i>You deserve to get sliced up,
you fucking prick tease.</i>

599
00:55:32,755 --> 00:55:33,958
<i>People like you shouldn't be</i>

600
00:55:34,024 --> 00:55:35,725
<i>given any bloody
responsibility.</i>

601
00:55:35,860 --> 00:55:37,294
<i>The evil is contagious</i>

602
00:55:37,361 --> 00:55:39,497
<i>and it's all your fault,
you horrible woman.</i>

603
00:55:39,629 --> 00:55:40,965
<i>You came round
my fucking house.</i>

604
00:55:41,098 --> 00:55:44,001
<i>He's shooting a juicy sequel
to Church at the moment.</i>

605
00:55:44,268 --> 00:55:45,735
<i>You're rotten inside.</i>

606
00:55:45,870 --> 00:55:47,805
<i>Nothing you ever do
will be any good.</i>

607
00:55:47,872 --> 00:55:50,141
<i>You touch things,
and they go to shit.</i>

608
00:56:07,258 --> 00:56:09,059
<i>Help me, please.</i>

609
00:56:09,360 --> 00:56:11,395
<i>Please, please.</i>

610
00:56:16,066 --> 00:56:17,168
Enid?

611
00:56:17,568 --> 00:56:18,836
You all right?

612
00:56:26,310 --> 00:56:27,878
We are in a viewing here.

613
00:56:29,280 --> 00:56:32,216
<i>Help me, help me.
Save me, please!</i>

614
00:56:32,349 --> 00:56:33,783
Er, Enid?

615
00:56:35,152 --> 00:56:36,220
Sorry.

616
00:56:37,321 --> 00:56:39,089
Someone's losing the plot.

617
00:56:47,431 --> 00:56:50,034
Hello? Can I help you?

618
00:56:53,270 --> 00:56:55,105
Excuse me, Enid!

619
00:57:00,444 --> 00:57:01,879
What do you think you're doing?

620
00:57:07,685 --> 00:57:10,054
Everything is
under control, Valerie.

621
00:57:10,221 --> 00:57:11,488
All right?

622
00:57:11,922 --> 00:57:14,124
No! No, no, no!
You're not authorized!

623
00:57:14,258 --> 00:57:16,227
"The Amnesiac Killer
stated in court

624
00:57:16,360 --> 00:57:18,062
that he had never seen
the film <i>Deranged,</i>

625
00:57:18,195 --> 00:57:19,496
which is supposed
to have influenced

626
00:57:19,597 --> 00:57:20,531
- the attack on..."
- What?

627
00:57:20,598 --> 00:57:22,299
So, he didn't even watch it?

628
00:57:22,433 --> 00:57:23,500
That's what it says here.

629
00:57:34,445 --> 00:57:35,546
Get back!

630
01:00:30,287 --> 01:00:33,290
Is this the film shoot
with Alice Lee?

631
01:00:42,966 --> 01:00:44,268
You're late.

632
01:00:48,472 --> 01:00:49,473
Sorry?

633
01:00:50,974 --> 01:00:54,211
I'm Debbie.
I'll be doing your make-up.

634
01:01:02,252 --> 01:01:04,354
You don't look anything
like your picture.

635
01:01:06,256 --> 01:01:09,259
At least you're here.
Half the cast haven't turned up.

636
01:01:09,960 --> 01:01:11,595
Production's all over the place.

637
01:01:20,571 --> 01:01:21,572
Come on.

638
01:01:23,106 --> 01:01:24,608
Let's get you ready.

639
01:01:40,892 --> 01:01:42,593
Top off.

640
01:01:54,939 --> 01:01:56,473
Head through.

641
01:01:56,941 --> 01:01:58,442
Head through.

642
01:02:10,822 --> 01:02:11,755
Sit.

643
01:02:13,123 --> 01:02:14,691
Down on the chair.

644
01:02:32,709 --> 01:02:34,012
Debbie!

645
01:02:34,177 --> 01:02:35,746
Is that the sister?

646
01:02:35,880 --> 01:02:36,981
Yeah.

647
01:02:37,447 --> 01:02:39,716
Frederick wants her
down in the forest.

648
01:02:39,851 --> 01:02:41,518
He's getting impatient.

649
01:02:42,921 --> 01:02:46,123
Oh, also still no sign
of the producer.

650
01:02:55,934 --> 01:02:57,801
It's so weird.

651
01:02:58,502 --> 01:02:59,469
Mm?

652
01:03:01,305 --> 01:03:04,274
Doug never misses
a gory murder scene.

653
01:03:36,540 --> 01:03:38,810
What have they got planned
for Alice Lee?

654
01:03:41,678 --> 01:03:43,113
What do you mean?

655
01:03:46,050 --> 01:03:47,484
Look at me.

656
01:04:32,096 --> 01:04:34,231
I've been waiting for you.

657
01:04:36,834 --> 01:04:39,369
Fred... Frederick North?

658
01:04:40,938 --> 01:04:44,708
Step into the light,
so I can see you.

659
01:04:47,544 --> 01:04:48,645
Hurry up.

660
01:04:58,188 --> 01:04:59,690
Where's Alice Lee?

661
01:05:02,359 --> 01:05:03,928
Big fan, are you?

662
01:05:06,496 --> 01:05:08,933
Well, someone told me
this was her last picture.

663
01:05:13,303 --> 01:05:15,372
You're guarded.

664
01:05:19,776 --> 01:05:22,779
That comes from a place
of fear, doesn't it?

665
01:05:26,516 --> 01:05:29,586
I want you to tell me
about <i>Don't Go In The Church.</i>

666
01:05:31,655 --> 01:05:32,656
That...

667
01:05:34,125 --> 01:05:36,393
That bit with the girls
where did the...

668
01:05:36,526 --> 01:05:38,462
where did the idea come from?

669
01:05:41,165 --> 01:05:43,233
Had an effect on you, did it?

670
01:05:51,209 --> 01:05:53,243
That scene...

671
01:05:57,949 --> 01:05:59,516
That scene...

672
01:06:01,752 --> 01:06:03,653
was inspired

673
01:06:05,655 --> 01:06:07,424
by a true story.

674
01:06:12,629 --> 01:06:14,899
All of my ideas...

675
01:06:16,433 --> 01:06:19,770
are drawn from real life.

676
01:06:22,173 --> 01:06:23,875
Well, that's not what happened.

677
01:06:24,775 --> 01:06:29,379
People think
that I create...

678
01:06:30,148 --> 01:06:31,581
the horror,

679
01:06:32,016 --> 01:06:33,383
but I don't.

680
01:06:35,685 --> 01:06:39,056
Horror is already out there...

681
01:06:40,925 --> 01:06:42,359
in all of us.

682
01:06:44,195 --> 01:06:45,662
It's in you.

683
01:06:46,396 --> 01:06:47,631
No, it's not.

684
01:06:47,764 --> 01:06:49,466
Of course, it is.

685
01:06:51,269 --> 01:06:53,303
Don't be so naïve.

686
01:06:54,504 --> 01:06:56,506
If you're gonna do this,

687
01:06:57,507 --> 01:07:00,144
I will need you to access

688
01:07:00,278 --> 01:07:02,814
your darkest impulses.

689
01:07:03,780 --> 01:07:05,049
I don't have any.

690
01:07:06,884 --> 01:07:10,487
No, they're in there.
Somewhere.

691
01:07:11,189 --> 01:07:13,390
- No, they're not.
- Oh, come on!

692
01:07:14,791 --> 01:07:16,861
Fucking commit!

693
01:07:20,832 --> 01:07:22,099
Improvise.

694
01:07:26,137 --> 01:07:29,739
Take control of your story.

695
01:07:33,277 --> 01:07:34,477
No.

696
01:07:34,611 --> 01:07:36,479
Okay, piss off then!

697
01:07:36,613 --> 01:07:38,481
No, please, no! Wait, wait!
Please, please. Wait.

698
01:07:38,548 --> 01:07:39,783
I just want my sister.

699
01:07:39,917 --> 01:07:42,186
I just want to see her!
I just really want to see

700
01:07:42,253 --> 01:07:45,388
my little sister.
I want her back, please!

701
01:07:45,957 --> 01:07:47,024
Please!

702
01:07:50,393 --> 01:07:51,695
All right.

703
01:07:54,098 --> 01:07:55,732
All right, we'll go with that.

704
01:07:57,701 --> 01:07:58,735
Let's play.

705
01:08:00,338 --> 01:08:03,875
There's something rotten
inside you.

706
01:08:04,608 --> 01:08:06,911
You try to control it,

707
01:08:07,044 --> 01:08:09,779
but you only make things worse.

708
01:08:10,915 --> 01:08:13,084
Don't fight it anymore.

709
01:08:13,217 --> 01:08:15,086
- Stop.
- Just let it out!

710
01:08:15,219 --> 01:08:16,620
Stop, it's you.

711
01:08:16,686 --> 01:08:18,421
You're trying to make me out
to be the bad person

712
01:08:18,488 --> 01:08:20,091
and it's you. Stop!

713
01:08:20,224 --> 01:08:21,758
There. That's it.

714
01:08:23,027 --> 01:08:25,029
And we'll take that energy

715
01:08:25,462 --> 01:08:26,864
into the scene.

716
01:08:29,033 --> 01:08:30,034
Come...

717
01:08:32,602 --> 01:08:34,171
enter your story.

718
01:09:25,923 --> 01:09:27,524
My love.

719
01:09:33,630 --> 01:09:35,967
I have been waiting for you.

720
01:09:37,034 --> 01:09:39,837
For such a long time.

721
01:09:40,838 --> 01:09:44,809
You have always been
in my heart.

722
01:10:18,442 --> 01:10:19,776
No.

723
01:10:30,587 --> 01:10:33,190
There's something
rotten inside you.

724
01:10:34,025 --> 01:10:35,159
Twisted up.

725
01:10:36,260 --> 01:10:38,762
It secretes bad things.

726
01:10:39,397 --> 01:10:42,665
Stop fighting it. Let it out!

727
01:10:43,134 --> 01:10:46,971
You know you are evil.

728
01:10:59,450 --> 01:11:02,219
No, this is not in the script!
No, no, no!

729
01:11:12,830 --> 01:11:14,198
Charles!

730
01:11:35,553 --> 01:11:40,224
I am the horror!

731
01:11:47,764 --> 01:11:48,899
Cut!

732
01:11:49,033 --> 01:11:50,534
What the fuck is going on?

733
01:11:50,667 --> 01:11:51,869
Charles!

734
01:11:52,002 --> 01:11:54,138
- Charles?
- No!

735
01:11:54,271 --> 01:11:56,040
What are you doing?

736
01:12:02,813 --> 01:12:04,949
- Frederick!
- No.

737
01:12:07,451 --> 01:12:08,919
What? W... Why w...

738
01:12:09,053 --> 01:12:12,189
You did this!
This is all your fault!

739
01:12:13,357 --> 01:12:16,759
(screams

740
01:12:17,828 --> 01:12:20,231
Nina!
Come back!

741
01:12:21,365 --> 01:12:23,434
Nina!

742
01:12:23,601 --> 01:12:24,869
Nina!

743
01:12:25,002 --> 01:12:27,404
No, please, please, please!
Get away from me, please!

744
01:12:27,538 --> 01:12:29,240
It's all right. It's all right.
It's me!

745
01:12:29,807 --> 01:12:33,043
It's me, Enid. All right?
I'm your sister.

746
01:12:33,544 --> 01:12:36,814
You... You killed Charles.

747
01:12:38,516 --> 01:12:41,651
No. No, he was gonna hurt you.

748
01:12:42,286 --> 01:12:45,256
He was my friend!

749
01:12:46,123 --> 01:12:51,028
No, everything that I have done
is to protect you.

750
01:12:52,630 --> 01:12:54,532
All right?
To make things right.

751
01:12:54,664 --> 01:12:56,433
- You're insane.
- No! Please.

752
01:12:56,567 --> 01:12:57,835
Please!

753
01:12:58,068 --> 01:13:00,204
- Please don't hurt me!
- No, it's all right, it's all right!

754
01:13:01,205 --> 01:13:02,373
I'm not gonna hurt you.

755
01:13:03,807 --> 01:13:05,209
Never hurt you.

756
01:13:07,545 --> 01:13:09,246
'Cause you're my sister.

757
01:13:10,247 --> 01:13:11,882
W... what?

758
01:13:13,716 --> 01:13:15,785
That wasn't real!

759
01:13:18,788 --> 01:13:21,025
Well, it has to be.
Please, because.

760
01:13:21,758 --> 01:13:23,360
'Cause you have her eyes.

761
01:13:24,828 --> 01:13:28,698
I already have a sister
and it's not you!

762
01:13:29,200 --> 01:13:30,234
No.

763
01:13:30,634 --> 01:13:32,503
No, please, no. You...

764
01:13:32,636 --> 01:13:34,471
No, you have to be her, please!

765
01:13:34,638 --> 01:13:36,574
No, please, be her.
Please!

766
01:13:36,706 --> 01:13:37,942
Please, be her.
Please!

767
01:13:38,075 --> 01:13:40,144
Please, you have to be her!
Please.

768
01:13:40,277 --> 01:13:42,913
Please,
you have to be her! Please.

769
01:13:43,047 --> 01:13:46,317
You have to be her, please.

770
01:13:46,417 --> 01:13:49,019
You have to be her, please.

771
01:13:50,753 --> 01:13:53,290
Please, you have to be her,
please.

772
01:13:56,660 --> 01:13:58,896
Please, you have to be her.

773
01:13:59,363 --> 01:14:00,931
Please.

774
01:14:01,065 --> 01:14:03,200
Please, you have to be her.

775
01:14:05,069 --> 01:14:06,303
Please.

776
01:14:07,504 --> 01:14:10,140
Please. Please, be her.

777
01:14:11,575 --> 01:14:14,511
Please, be her.
Please, please.

778
01:14:14,777 --> 01:14:17,915
Please, be her.
Please, be her.

779
01:14:18,515 --> 01:14:20,017
Please, be her.

780
01:14:21,685 --> 01:14:22,987
Please, be her.

781
01:15:18,475 --> 01:15:19,576
Nina!

782
01:15:20,144 --> 01:15:23,247
You came back to save me.

783
01:15:23,681 --> 01:15:24,848
Yes.

784
01:15:27,318 --> 01:15:28,419
I did.

785
01:15:30,421 --> 01:15:32,956
Come on, let's go home.

786
01:16:08,058 --> 01:16:09,593
<i>And what's fascinating is,</i>

787
01:16:09,727 --> 01:16:12,096
<i>that now these issues
have been dealt with properly,</i>

788
01:16:12,229 --> 01:16:15,866
<i>the video nasties have
been eradicated completely.</i>

789
01:16:16,300 --> 01:16:19,937
<i>The crime rate in Britain
has actually dropped to zero.</i>

790
01:16:20,070 --> 01:16:21,972
<i>It's just like we said,</i>

791
01:16:22,239 --> 01:16:25,042
<i>the streets of Britain
are safe at last.</i>

792
01:16:25,175 --> 01:16:28,078
<i>The employment rate
is at a record high.</i>

793
01:16:28,212 --> 01:16:30,447
<i>The criminals
are all locked up.</i>

794
01:16:31,782 --> 01:16:33,951
<i>There's nothing
to be afraid of.</i>

795
01:17:31,008 --> 01:17:33,277
Found her.

796
01:17:48,358 --> 01:17:50,060
Save me!

797
01:17:51,028 --> 01:17:53,096
Help me!

798
