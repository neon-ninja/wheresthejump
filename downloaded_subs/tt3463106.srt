2
00:02:24,231 --> 00:02:25,732
Are you okay?

3
00:02:32,572 --> 00:02:34,491
What do you think it's
gonna be like out there?

4
00:02:38,703 --> 00:02:40,996
It'll get back to normal.

5
00:02:40,998 --> 00:02:42,542
You'll see.

6
00:03:04,897 --> 00:03:06,566
How long
were you infected?

7
00:03:07,817 --> 00:03:10,025
Four years.

8
00:03:10,027 --> 00:03:11,985
Did you have to be
potty-trained again?

9
00:03:14,364 --> 00:03:16,033
Are you having
any violent impulses?

10
00:03:16,909 --> 00:03:17,827
No.

11
00:03:19,704 --> 00:03:21,413
Any nightmares?

12
00:03:24,209 --> 00:03:25,833
Good.

13
00:03:25,835 --> 00:03:28,543
They're there to remind
you what you did.

14
00:03:28,545 --> 00:03:29,629
The suffering you caused.

15
00:03:32,467 --> 00:03:35,884
The nightmares mean there might
be something human left.

16
00:03:35,886 --> 00:03:38,055
Makes you wonder about those
that don't have them, huh?

17
00:03:41,641 --> 00:03:43,141
You'll report to me
every week.

18
00:03:43,143 --> 00:03:44,935
Lateness will not
be tolerated.

19
00:03:44,937 --> 00:03:46,729
Skipping work
will not be tolerated.

20
00:03:46,731 --> 00:03:48,646
Anti-social behavior
will not be tolerated.

21
00:03:48,648 --> 00:03:49,898
Basically you do
what I say

22
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:53,151
and your life will be..

23
00:03:53,153 --> 00:03:54,654
...better.

24
00:03:57,117 --> 00:03:59,993
Your sister-in-law,
Abigail Reynolds

25
00:03:59,995 --> 00:04:01,786
has agreed
to take you in.

26
00:04:02,955 --> 00:04:04,287
I didn't put
in a request.

27
00:04:04,289 --> 00:04:06,206
Charlie Three Three Bravo,
this is..

28
00:04:06,208 --> 00:04:09,459
Not everyone gets
to go home, Senan.

29
00:04:09,461 --> 00:04:10,543
You should be grateful.

30
00:04:10,545 --> 00:04:12,631
Bus ready to depart. Out.

31
00:04:15,050 --> 00:04:16,549
Close the gate.

32
00:04:16,551 --> 00:04:18,301
Delta Echo One Zero.

33
00:04:18,303 --> 00:04:21,222
Bus passes,
checkpoint four. Over.

34
00:04:21,224 --> 00:04:22,515
Charlie Three Three Bravo

35
00:04:22,517 --> 00:04:24,182
this is Charlie
Two One Alpha.

36
00:04:24,184 --> 00:04:25,226
- The last bus is loading.
- Get on the bus quickly.

37
00:04:25,228 --> 00:04:26,394
- Ready the gate. Over.
- Single file.

38
00:04:26,396 --> 00:04:27,685
Take your seats.

39
00:04:27,687 --> 00:04:29,355
Charlie Three Three Alpha.

40
00:04:29,357 --> 00:04:31,651
Transport departing
in two minutes. Out.

41
00:04:37,572 --> 00:04:39,240
The cure was supposed to
be some sort of great hope

42
00:04:39,242 --> 00:04:40,658
but things are
just gettin' worse.

43
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:42,743
That's not fair.
My daughter was released.

44
00:04:42,745 --> 00:04:44,662
Whatever she did she can't
hurt anyone anymore.

45
00:04:44,664 --> 00:04:45,997
People need to give
them a second chance.

46
00:04:45,999 --> 00:04:48,081
We've given them
every chance.

47
00:04:48,083 --> 00:04:50,418
They're not integrating. No
wonder crime's on the rise.

48
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:52,085
They're not
like us anymore.

49
00:04:52,087 --> 00:04:53,962
They would if they were
given some choices

50
00:04:53,964 --> 00:04:55,298
instead of being treated like
they were still infected.

51
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:57,300
Have you seen the news?
The violence?

52
00:04:57,302 --> 00:04:58,927
The vandalism? There's
something wrong with them.

53
00:04:58,929 --> 00:05:00,136
They're not human.

54
00:05:01,556 --> 00:05:03,471
They don't, they don't
have a worry.

55
00:05:03,473 --> 00:05:04,640
They're just scum.

56
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,607
Scumbags! Murderers!

57
00:05:14,609 --> 00:05:17,946
Scum! Scum! Scum!

58
00:05:17,948 --> 00:05:20,488
Welcome to the
accommodation center.

59
00:05:21,826 --> 00:05:23,826
For those of
you going home

60
00:05:23,828 --> 00:05:25,994
please make your way
to the left.

61
00:05:25,996 --> 00:05:27,996
Which is my right.

62
00:05:27,998 --> 00:05:29,958
Make your way
to my right.

63
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:31,167
Which is your left.

64
00:05:31,169 --> 00:05:33,251
Left is home.

65
00:05:33,253 --> 00:05:34,671
Senan.

66
00:05:36,506 --> 00:05:37,881
You're not human!

67
00:05:37,883 --> 00:05:39,550
You're not human!

68
00:05:43,056 --> 00:05:44,390
Don't tell her.

69
00:05:52,522 --> 00:05:54,732
We need to look out for
each other out here, okay?

70
00:05:59,364 --> 00:06:02,365
Keep it moving, people.
Thank you.

71
00:06:02,367 --> 00:06:04,034
Through that door,
please.

72
00:06:06,579 --> 00:06:09,747
Don't stop. Keep going,
please. Through the door.

73
00:06:17,757 --> 00:06:19,923
What are your thoughts on the
release of the Third Wave?

74
00:06:19,925 --> 00:06:21,259
I think we can't
take any more.

75
00:06:21,261 --> 00:06:23,094
I think the First Wave

76
00:06:23,096 --> 00:06:24,427
and the Second Wave

77
00:06:24,429 --> 00:06:27,805
have been
a fucking disaster.

78
00:06:27,807 --> 00:06:29,432
No one wants them here.

79
00:06:29,434 --> 00:06:31,809
Not much against them.
Just... just no craic.

80
00:06:31,811 --> 00:06:32,810
- Yeah.
- You know what I mean?

81
00:06:32,812 --> 00:06:34,230
They just mope around.

82
00:06:34,232 --> 00:06:35,313
Bit of a hum
off them, to be honest.

83
00:06:39,612 --> 00:06:40,653
Oh, shit!

84
00:06:40,655 --> 00:06:42,655
My uncle came back
in the First Wave.

85
00:06:42,657 --> 00:06:44,657
And how is he now?

86
00:06:44,659 --> 00:06:46,449
He killed himself
last year.

87
00:06:46,451 --> 00:06:48,995
UN's pullin' out. Who the
fuck is gonna stay put?

88
00:06:48,997 --> 00:06:50,328
They're out there,
right now.

89
00:06:50,330 --> 00:06:52,455
Infected, Cured,
they're all the same.

90
00:06:52,457 --> 00:06:54,332
Wipe the fuckin' lot of them
out, that's what I say.

91
00:06:54,334 --> 00:06:56,169
The government now face
a very difficult dilemma

92
00:06:56,171 --> 00:06:59,130
of what to do with
the 25% of infected

93
00:06:59,132 --> 00:07:00,423
who remain resistant
to the cure.

94
00:07:00,425 --> 00:07:02,966
I mean, what they did..
I mean..

95
00:07:02,968 --> 00:07:04,677
How do you get over that?

96
00:07:04,679 --> 00:07:06,014
Repent!

97
00:07:11,394 --> 00:07:12,812
Repent!

98
00:07:14,564 --> 00:07:16,147
Hop on.

99
00:07:16,149 --> 00:07:18,524
Ready, activate. Go!

100
00:07:18,526 --> 00:07:19,986
Whoosh!

101
00:07:23,573 --> 00:07:25,240
Is this it? Is this
all your homework?

102
00:07:27,702 --> 00:07:29,660
Hmm. Great job.

103
00:07:31,746 --> 00:07:32,705
You don't even need me.

104
00:07:45,095 --> 00:07:46,261
Hi.

105
00:07:54,394 --> 00:07:55,981
I don't have to stay.

106
00:07:59,067 --> 00:08:01,111
It's what.. It's what
Luke would have wanted.

107
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:08,450
Besides... technically
it's your house.

108
00:08:11,621 --> 00:08:13,121
It hasn't changed at all.

109
00:08:13,123 --> 00:08:15,957
I was... gonna hire

110
00:08:15,959 --> 00:08:18,166
an interior designer,
but, um..

111
00:08:18,168 --> 00:08:20,168
They all got eaten.

112
00:08:30,514 --> 00:08:31,807
Sorry.

113
00:08:35,686 --> 00:08:37,852
I thought that maybe if you made
it you would have gone home.

114
00:08:37,854 --> 00:08:39,897
Cillian was born here.

115
00:08:39,899 --> 00:08:42,734
And only uninfected US
nationals are considered.

116
00:08:45,530 --> 00:08:46,907
I guess we're a risk.

117
00:08:51,077 --> 00:08:52,578
Did they give you a job?

118
00:08:53,914 --> 00:08:55,579
There was a..

119
00:08:55,581 --> 00:08:57,497
...an opening
at the treatment center.

120
00:08:57,499 --> 00:08:59,169
Why would you
wanna stay there?

121
00:09:02,923 --> 00:09:05,423
It's just being
a porter again.

122
00:09:05,425 --> 00:09:07,384
Luke always said you were
wasting your time with that.

123
00:09:21,899 --> 00:09:23,899
Were you with him?

124
00:09:23,901 --> 00:09:25,277
At the end?

125
00:09:29,656 --> 00:09:30,991
We got separated.

126
00:09:42,253 --> 00:09:44,172
You wanna go say hi?

127
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:50,845
Hey.

128
00:10:12,033 --> 00:10:13,701
Are you one
of the Cured?

129
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:19,249
Yeah.

130
00:10:22,334 --> 00:10:24,254
Will you be sick again?

131
00:10:30,592 --> 00:10:31,927
I don't think so.

132
00:10:36,432 --> 00:10:38,351
Is it nice to be back?

133
00:10:43,523 --> 00:10:46,567
Yeah. It is.

134
00:11:11,592 --> 00:11:13,676
Make your way to the
nearest evacuation point.

135
00:11:15,346 --> 00:11:18,263
- Abbie! Abbie!
- Even if a loved one.

136
00:11:18,265 --> 00:11:20,015
Make your way to the nearest
evacuation point.

137
00:11:20,017 --> 00:11:20,934
Luke.

138
00:11:20,936 --> 00:11:22,019
Luke!

139
00:11:22,979 --> 00:11:24,189
We have to go.

140
00:11:27,483 --> 00:11:28,776
Abbie knows what to do.

141
00:11:39,661 --> 00:11:40,705
No!

142
00:11:43,333 --> 00:11:44,584
Senan!

143
00:11:45,417 --> 00:11:46,584
Run!

144
00:11:46,586 --> 00:11:48,043
Run!

145
00:12:16,532 --> 00:12:17,907
Do you have
what it takes to join

146
00:12:17,909 --> 00:12:19,408
the Irish Defense
Volunteers?

147
00:12:19,410 --> 00:12:20,575
Well, call..

148
00:12:36,468 --> 00:12:37,762
Hi, Dad.

149
00:12:42,224 --> 00:12:44,351
They have me working
as a cleaner.

150
00:12:45,686 --> 00:12:47,188
It's ridiculous.

151
00:12:50,482 --> 00:12:52,525
I thought maybe..

152
00:12:52,527 --> 00:12:54,361
...you could put in a good
word at some firms you know.

153
00:12:55,947 --> 00:12:57,698
Get me back
in the courtroom.

154
00:13:00,201 --> 00:13:01,702
Please, Dad.

155
00:13:02,619 --> 00:13:03,954
Mum wouldn't want this.

156
00:13:05,872 --> 00:13:07,832
Don't you dare
mention her.

157
00:13:09,794 --> 00:13:11,712
I saw what you did to her.

158
00:13:13,089 --> 00:13:14,257
You're a monster.

159
00:13:15,091 --> 00:13:16,217
Dad..

160
00:13:56,924 --> 00:13:58,423
This is Foxtrot
Sierra Nine Two.

161
00:13:58,425 --> 00:14:00,595
There's been another
attack on a Cured. Over.

162
00:14:02,347 --> 00:14:04,263
November Oscar 64

163
00:14:04,265 --> 00:14:05,764
this is
Papa Golf Twenty-Two.

164
00:14:05,766 --> 00:14:07,852
Perimeter is secure. Out.

165
00:14:22,699 --> 00:14:24,284
Twenty-six, seven..

166
00:14:27,872 --> 00:14:29,704
Sierra Two One,
UN withdrawal

167
00:14:29,706 --> 00:14:31,501
commencing at
1400 hours.

168
00:14:40,635 --> 00:14:42,137
You're over there.

169
00:15:46,658 --> 00:15:48,328
You must be the help.

170
00:15:49,996 --> 00:15:51,829
She one of the Resistant?

171
00:15:51,831 --> 00:15:53,663
What do you think?

172
00:15:56,543 --> 00:15:58,213
Do you have any
medical training?

173
00:16:00,047 --> 00:16:01,546
I was a porter.

174
00:16:01,548 --> 00:16:03,132
Jesus Christ!

175
00:16:03,134 --> 00:16:04,049
They take away
my staff and give me

176
00:16:04,051 --> 00:16:06,676
a fucking trolley pusher.

177
00:16:06,678 --> 00:16:08,803
Hold her arm.

178
00:16:08,805 --> 00:16:11,141
Are you here to help me or not?
Hold her fucking arm!

179
00:16:27,617 --> 00:16:29,119
Good girl.

180
00:16:32,788 --> 00:16:35,289
She's not attackin' me.

181
00:16:35,291 --> 00:16:38,251
It's the same reason you
can't get chicken pox twice.

182
00:16:38,253 --> 00:16:40,630
Once infected, your cells retain
a trace of the Maze virus.

183
00:16:42,965 --> 00:16:44,634
She thinks
you're one of them.

184
00:16:48,804 --> 00:16:51,639
- Where are the others?
- I don't have access any more.

185
00:16:51,641 --> 00:16:53,559
They've allowed me to
continue caring for her.

186
00:16:56,562 --> 00:16:58,273
She's all that matters.

187
00:16:59,481 --> 00:17:01,150
We have to cure her.

188
00:17:20,669 --> 00:17:23,045
How could you
take one in? Huh?

189
00:17:23,047 --> 00:17:24,337
Please, this
isn't the place.

190
00:17:24,339 --> 00:17:25,548
They're murderers,
the lot of them.

191
00:17:25,550 --> 00:17:26,839
Come on, love,
now's not the time.

192
00:17:26,841 --> 00:17:27,884
Back off.

193
00:17:27,886 --> 00:17:29,177
Murderers!

194
00:17:51,284 --> 00:17:53,451
Can I make Senan
lunch tomorrow?

195
00:17:53,453 --> 00:17:54,867
What do you
wanna make him?

196
00:17:54,869 --> 00:17:56,413
If it's peanut butter
and chocolate chip..

197
00:17:59,459 --> 00:18:01,294
...and I'm gonna
cut it in half.

198
00:18:50,050 --> 00:18:52,718
Despite condemnation
from around the world

199
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:54,220
the Irish government
will commence

200
00:18:54,222 --> 00:18:57,891
the humane elimination
of the resistant 25%.

201
00:18:57,893 --> 00:19:00,183
The Taoiseach has called
it an act of mercy

202
00:19:00,185 --> 00:19:02,645
insisting the hope
of refining the cure

203
00:19:02,647 --> 00:19:04,232
is no longer a reality.

204
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:06,482
You.

205
00:19:06,484 --> 00:19:07,483
- Hmm?
- You.

206
00:19:07,485 --> 00:19:08,816
- He's the king.
- Gosh.

207
00:19:08,818 --> 00:19:10,861
Can't we work
together, maybe?

208
00:19:10,863 --> 00:19:11,988
Okay.

209
00:19:11,990 --> 00:19:13,074
Cool.

210
00:19:21,291 --> 00:19:23,581
I was in prison.
This is worse.

211
00:19:23,583 --> 00:19:26,419
We're treated
like lepers.

212
00:19:26,421 --> 00:19:28,296
It's right that
they're scared, though.

213
00:19:28,298 --> 00:19:29,462
I mean.. What we did..

214
00:19:29,464 --> 00:19:30,798
Why?

215
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:33,134
Why is it right
that they're scared?

216
00:19:33,136 --> 00:19:34,635
They're not
the ones living here

217
00:19:34,637 --> 00:19:36,431
having their every
move monitored.

218
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:39,222
We need to march.

219
00:19:39,224 --> 00:19:41,393
We need to stand up
and say..

220
00:19:49,985 --> 00:19:51,444
You didn't tell her.

221
00:19:56,491 --> 00:19:59,242
You were right to lie.

222
00:19:59,244 --> 00:20:02,288
They're all the same when
they know the truth.

223
00:20:02,290 --> 00:20:03,871
They just want us
to continue

224
00:20:03,873 --> 00:20:06,292
killing ourselves,
and solve the problem..

225
00:20:06,294 --> 00:20:07,628
Did you see them?

226
00:20:11,049 --> 00:20:13,381
The Resistant
don't attack us.

227
00:20:15,510 --> 00:20:18,054
They think
we're still infected.

228
00:20:18,056 --> 00:20:19,724
What does that mean?

229
00:20:23,894 --> 00:20:25,730
Means we're safer
with them than the rest.

230
00:20:31,569 --> 00:20:32,695
Move.

231
00:20:50,295 --> 00:20:51,964
You've been
skippin' work.

232
00:20:54,634 --> 00:20:56,134
I'm not a cleaner.

233
00:21:01,266 --> 00:21:03,141
You know..

234
00:21:03,143 --> 00:21:05,558
...I knew people
like you..

235
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:07,936
...before the outbreak.

236
00:21:07,938 --> 00:21:10,606
They thought the world
was theirs on a platter.

237
00:21:10,608 --> 00:21:12,650
Lookin' down on
the rest of us.

238
00:21:12,652 --> 00:21:14,612
But here... now..

239
00:21:15,906 --> 00:21:18,114
...I'm in charge.

240
00:21:18,116 --> 00:21:20,576
I decide whether your life
is happy or miserable.

241
00:21:22,662 --> 00:21:24,747
You just have to
learn to obey.

242
00:21:29,127 --> 00:21:31,129
- Is that it?
- No.

243
00:21:37,342 --> 00:21:39,887
Stop harassing
your family.

244
00:21:42,222 --> 00:21:44,515
They don't want you back.

245
00:21:46,561 --> 00:21:48,476
Get the fuck back.

246
00:21:58,738 --> 00:22:00,781
It's not your world
any more.

247
00:22:46,829 --> 00:22:48,248
He's awake!

248
00:23:05,180 --> 00:23:06,641
It's just kids.

249
00:23:08,683 --> 00:23:10,393
We've been through worse.

250
00:23:15,483 --> 00:23:17,358
They suit you.

251
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:18,904
His clothes.

252
00:23:22,532 --> 00:23:23,907
Where were you
last night?

253
00:23:23,909 --> 00:23:25,868
I had to go see
a friend.

254
00:23:28,203 --> 00:23:29,579
I have to go.

255
00:23:34,544 --> 00:23:36,044
Smile, Cillian.

256
00:23:36,046 --> 00:23:37,335
- We love you, ma.
- Smile!

257
00:23:44,012 --> 00:23:45,011
- Hi.
- Hm.

258
00:23:45,013 --> 00:23:46,679
He suits you, yeah?

259
00:23:46,681 --> 00:23:47,933
- Yeah!
- Cute.

260
00:23:49,184 --> 00:23:50,641
Oh, my God, that
toy is gonna be

261
00:23:50,643 --> 00:23:52,435
the death of me.

262
00:23:52,437 --> 00:23:54,727
- It's trippy, isn't it?
- It is a bit, yeah.

263
00:23:58,108 --> 00:23:59,400
Abbie. How's it going?

264
00:23:59,402 --> 00:24:00,944
Did you get my footage?

265
00:24:00,946 --> 00:24:02,445
The withdrawal's
started already

266
00:24:02,447 --> 00:24:04,322
whatever talks they're
having are bullshit.

267
00:24:04,324 --> 00:24:06,282
Yeah, yeah, I got it,
but look, um..

268
00:24:06,284 --> 00:24:08,741
It's just not a story of
interest for us right now.

269
00:24:08,743 --> 00:24:10,661
No, it's too soon,
I'm telling you

270
00:24:10,663 --> 00:24:11,995
the country isn't ready.

271
00:24:11,997 --> 00:24:13,456
The Resistant
are still alive

272
00:24:13,458 --> 00:24:15,123
it's not safe yet.

273
00:24:15,125 --> 00:24:16,960
Tell that to
the families here.

274
00:24:16,962 --> 00:24:18,794
Look, I... I do have
something for you to cover.

275
00:24:18,796 --> 00:24:20,628
The first McDonalds
is reopening.

276
00:24:20,630 --> 00:24:21,923
I need some coverage.

277
00:24:21,925 --> 00:24:23,506
If it's beneath you,
I can..

278
00:24:23,508 --> 00:24:26,344
Despite protests,
the humane elimination

279
00:24:26,346 --> 00:24:29,180
of the resistant 25%
is now under way

280
00:24:29,182 --> 00:24:30,513
with the military
estimating it will be

281
00:24:30,515 --> 00:24:32,683
completed by the end
of the week.

282
00:24:47,157 --> 00:24:48,158
Abbie.

283
00:24:51,329 --> 00:24:53,371
Sorry, I'm a friend
of Senan's.

284
00:24:53,373 --> 00:24:54,872
From quarantine?

285
00:24:54,874 --> 00:24:56,001
What gave it away?

286
00:24:57,835 --> 00:25:00,088
I was working
and I just saw you.

287
00:25:01,922 --> 00:25:03,590
Anyway, it's nice
to finally meet you.

288
00:25:07,677 --> 00:25:09,346
Was Senan with
you last night?

289
00:25:15,103 --> 00:25:16,852
It must have been tough.

290
00:25:16,854 --> 00:25:18,940
Raising a child alone
through the outbreak.

291
00:25:19,564 --> 00:25:21,064
I managed.

292
00:25:21,066 --> 00:25:23,151
Of course.

293
00:25:23,153 --> 00:25:25,653
I didn't mean
anything by it.

294
00:25:25,655 --> 00:25:27,782
I'm sorry.
It's just force of habit.

295
00:25:30,994 --> 00:25:33,244
I guess being a cleaner wasn't
your top career choice, huh?

296
00:25:33,246 --> 00:25:34,289
No.

297
00:25:35,165 --> 00:25:37,498
I'm a barrister.

298
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:40,333
I was actually running for
election before all this.

299
00:25:40,335 --> 00:25:41,503
Well, maybe you can
run again.

300
00:25:42,255 --> 00:25:43,506
No, I doubt it.

301
00:25:44,839 --> 00:25:46,508
It's nice
to have your vote.

302
00:25:48,678 --> 00:25:50,345
How did you get that?

303
00:25:51,181 --> 00:25:52,845
This?

304
00:25:52,847 --> 00:25:54,599
Um, I was late for work.

305
00:25:56,311 --> 00:25:59,020
You have to complain.

306
00:25:59,022 --> 00:26:01,524
The guy we complain to has a
pretty decent right hook.

307
00:26:07,862 --> 00:26:10,238
What was it like?

308
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:11,366
Quarantine?

309
00:26:13,203 --> 00:26:14,412
No, before that.

310
00:26:16,539 --> 00:26:18,208
Why don't you ask Senan?

311
00:26:19,749 --> 00:26:21,168
I can't.

312
00:26:25,255 --> 00:26:27,174
Everyone says it's hell.

313
00:26:30,845 --> 00:26:33,348
It's like being trapped
inside your body.

314
00:26:34,849 --> 00:26:36,516
Fighting to stop yourself.

315
00:26:38,436 --> 00:26:41,269
But what they
don't talk about..

316
00:26:41,271 --> 00:26:42,940
...is the moment
when you stop fighting.

317
00:26:45,235 --> 00:26:47,237
When you start to
just go with it.

318
00:26:59,832 --> 00:27:02,127
Gosh, I have to
get back to work.

319
00:27:06,089 --> 00:27:07,340
Thank you.

320
00:27:09,634 --> 00:27:11,092
For what?

321
00:27:11,094 --> 00:27:12,762
For not treating me
like an animal.

322
00:27:15,015 --> 00:27:16,932
Senan's very lucky
to have you.

323
00:27:49,007 --> 00:27:51,089
Nerve degradation
remains the same.

324
00:27:51,091 --> 00:27:53,384
Subject 301 shows
no sign of change.

325
00:27:53,386 --> 00:27:54,592
Recommend
upping the percentage

326
00:27:54,594 --> 00:27:56,513
of Bendamustine
in the formula.

327
00:27:58,348 --> 00:28:00,683
Sometimes I feel it.

328
00:28:00,685 --> 00:28:01,935
Screaming to get out.

329
00:28:01,937 --> 00:28:03,519
The cure prevents

330
00:28:03,521 --> 00:28:05,688
reinfection
or transmission.

331
00:28:05,690 --> 00:28:07,357
You're one of
the lucky ones.

332
00:28:31,925 --> 00:28:34,132
They were never gonna
keep the Resistant alive

333
00:28:34,134 --> 00:28:35,927
with the
withdrawal happening.

334
00:28:35,929 --> 00:28:38,179
We have to do something
to stop them.

335
00:28:38,181 --> 00:28:40,850
- Now.
- We need to target the IDV.

336
00:29:52,297 --> 00:29:53,631
Fuckin' screamers.

337
00:29:56,509 --> 00:29:58,801
Hey, what the fuck
are you doing?

338
00:29:58,803 --> 00:30:00,805
- Prick.
- Nick, I need help here!

339
00:30:03,016 --> 00:30:04,684
- You're one of them.
- Aah!

340
00:30:10,190 --> 00:30:11,189
Shit!

341
00:30:39,052 --> 00:30:41,221
Squadron Eight.
Perimeter clear.

342
00:30:46,935 --> 00:30:48,853
They're gonna die anyway.

343
00:31:07,913 --> 00:31:11,207
Cured rights now!
Cured rights now!

344
00:31:11,209 --> 00:31:12,916
Cured rights now!

345
00:31:18,591 --> 00:31:20,133
The truth is
that every day

346
00:31:20,135 --> 00:31:21,467
that the Resistant
remain alive

347
00:31:21,469 --> 00:31:23,594
is a day that we risk
another outbreak.

348
00:31:23,596 --> 00:31:26,179
But I can find a cure.

349
00:31:26,181 --> 00:31:29,017
I just need time
and resources.

350
00:31:29,019 --> 00:31:31,809
We have a stretched
medical system.

351
00:31:31,811 --> 00:31:33,146
We have to redirect
our efforts

352
00:31:33,148 --> 00:31:34,812
back to the populace.

353
00:31:34,814 --> 00:31:36,439
You're talking
about killing

354
00:31:36,441 --> 00:31:38,360
almost 5000 people.

355
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:43,864
Joan... I fear
your personal loss

356
00:31:43,866 --> 00:31:46,659
has clouded your judgment.

357
00:31:46,661 --> 00:31:49,827
But I would ask you,
and indeed all those

358
00:31:49,829 --> 00:31:51,539
with loved ones
amongst the Resistant

359
00:31:51,541 --> 00:31:52,999
do you really want them
to live

360
00:31:53,001 --> 00:31:55,793
as these monsters
forever?

361
00:31:55,795 --> 00:31:57,712
They won't stop
with the Resistant.

362
00:31:59,674 --> 00:32:01,551
They want us all dead.

363
00:32:04,679 --> 00:32:06,139
We have to stop them.

364
00:32:58,648 --> 00:32:59,942
Senan. Senan.

365
00:33:02,862 --> 00:33:04,114
They're all empty targets.

366
00:33:05,530 --> 00:33:07,367
I promise you no one
will get hurt.

367
00:34:00,045 --> 00:34:01,960
- Hello.
- Hey, there's been a series of bombings.

368
00:34:01,962 --> 00:34:03,296
- How many?
- They're reporting five.

369
00:34:03,298 --> 00:34:04,881
Okay. Okay, just, uh..

370
00:34:04,883 --> 00:34:07,048
I have to drop off my son.
Give me 30 minutes.

371
00:34:07,050 --> 00:34:09,385
Cillian?
Cillian, let's go.

372
00:34:12,098 --> 00:34:13,224
Senan?

373
00:34:17,103 --> 00:34:18,980
Cured en route.

374
00:34:19,772 --> 00:34:22,106
Understood.

375
00:34:22,108 --> 00:34:24,150
There have been several
injured and one dead.

376
00:34:24,152 --> 00:34:27,236
The targets were the homes
of Irish Defense Volunteers.

377
00:34:27,238 --> 00:34:29,946
The Cured Alliance have claimed
responsibility for the attacks.

378
00:34:29,948 --> 00:34:31,490
The government have
insisted that they are

379
00:34:31,492 --> 00:34:33,034
a terrorist
organization.

380
00:34:33,036 --> 00:34:34,535
It's several weeks now
since the..

381
00:34:34,537 --> 00:34:37,621
Squadron Eight.
Perimeter clear.

382
00:34:37,623 --> 00:34:40,624
Cured rights now!
Cured rights now!

383
00:34:40,626 --> 00:34:42,208
Calm down, will you?
Get in the car!

384
00:34:42,210 --> 00:34:44,670
Get in the fuckin' car!
Calm down! Get in the car.

385
00:34:44,672 --> 00:34:47,631
Cured rights now!
Cured rights now!

386
00:34:47,633 --> 00:34:51,010
Cured rights now!
Cured rights now!

387
00:34:51,012 --> 00:34:54,388
Cured rights now!
Cured rights now!

388
00:34:54,390 --> 00:34:57,558
Cured rights now!
Cured rights now!

389
00:34:57,560 --> 00:34:58,642
Cured rights now!

390
00:35:15,078 --> 00:35:16,371
Senan.

391
00:35:17,205 --> 00:35:19,207
Senan, it's me. Please.

392
00:35:22,293 --> 00:35:23,586
Senan, please.

393
00:35:26,797 --> 00:35:28,049
Senan..

394
00:35:29,885 --> 00:35:32,303
Senan, please!
Please, Senan!

395
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:44,399
No! Stop!

396
00:35:45,650 --> 00:35:46,943
Please!

397
00:35:54,409 --> 00:35:55,824
I know it's been hard
for you all

398
00:35:55,826 --> 00:35:58,661
being beaten and bullied
and forgotten.

399
00:35:58,663 --> 00:36:00,496
There's no one
looking out for us

400
00:36:00,498 --> 00:36:02,206
but I promise
that ends now.

401
00:36:02,208 --> 00:36:04,000
Today will be
the first day

402
00:36:04,002 --> 00:36:05,877
on the road
to our freedom.

403
00:36:05,879 --> 00:36:07,711
Whoo! Yeah!

404
00:36:07,713 --> 00:36:09,465
- Yes!
- Whoo!

405
00:36:38,578 --> 00:36:40,246
You know we found
the cure together?

406
00:36:42,165 --> 00:36:43,917
You can't imagine
the excitement.

407
00:36:46,252 --> 00:36:48,046
Later we realized that..

408
00:36:50,966 --> 00:36:53,466
...the subject remembered

409
00:36:53,468 --> 00:36:55,428
what they did
when infected.

410
00:37:00,058 --> 00:37:01,309
Was it worth it?

411
00:37:02,978 --> 00:37:04,645
After everything
we've done?

412
00:37:07,107 --> 00:37:09,109
You weren't in control,
you were just sick.

413
00:37:18,159 --> 00:37:19,660
We cured you.

414
00:37:23,498 --> 00:37:25,166
You get to choose
who you want to be.

415
00:37:28,586 --> 00:37:30,044
Does puppy's baby
have a name?

416
00:37:30,046 --> 00:37:33,047
Uh... Andrew.

417
00:37:33,049 --> 00:37:34,465
- Andrew?
- Yeah.

418
00:37:34,467 --> 00:37:36,175
I'm just making up..

419
00:37:36,177 --> 00:37:38,302
I'm just making up
normal names.

420
00:37:38,304 --> 00:37:39,222
Mm.

421
00:37:46,854 --> 00:37:48,648
Are you involved
with the Cured Alliance?

422
00:37:50,650 --> 00:37:51,567
No.

423
00:37:52,652 --> 00:37:54,570
So where do you go
at night?

424
00:37:56,239 --> 00:37:57,908
I don't want to
get in your way.

425
00:38:14,715 --> 00:38:17,052
There was so much chaos
after the Outbreak.

426
00:38:19,220 --> 00:38:22,307
It was two years before we could
begin to re-enter the city.

427
00:38:27,478 --> 00:38:29,940
We started to hear
a rumor of a cure.

428
00:38:35,111 --> 00:38:38,656
I actually convinced myself
that Luke was infected.

429
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:45,621
Just... waiting
to be rescued.

430
00:38:54,797 --> 00:38:56,299
And then I came home.

431
00:39:00,678 --> 00:39:02,763
I thought they'd cleared
the entire city.

432
00:39:07,643 --> 00:39:10,063
The smell hit me first.

433
00:39:16,402 --> 00:39:17,570
Luke's gone.

434
00:39:19,572 --> 00:39:21,489
We're your family.

435
00:39:21,491 --> 00:39:22,575
Abbie..

436
00:39:25,411 --> 00:39:26,412
Mom?

437
00:39:29,415 --> 00:39:30,708
Hey, sweetie.

438
00:39:38,091 --> 00:39:39,759
How far outside the city
can we go?

439
00:40:29,309 --> 00:40:31,436
Me and your dad used to come
here when we were kids.

440
00:40:39,319 --> 00:40:40,987
It's as if
nothing happened.

441
00:40:49,079 --> 00:40:50,536
Liar, liar,
pants on fire.

442
00:40:50,538 --> 00:40:52,330
- What's her name?
- What?

443
00:40:52,332 --> 00:40:54,582
What's her name?

444
00:40:54,584 --> 00:40:55,749
Beatrice.

445
00:40:55,751 --> 00:40:57,418
Don't get me started
on this.

446
00:40:58,546 --> 00:41:00,171
Yeah.

447
00:41:00,173 --> 00:41:01,839
Then what we doing
with them?

448
00:41:03,927 --> 00:41:05,011
I'll get it.

449
00:41:05,595 --> 00:41:07,511
What's that?

450
00:41:07,513 --> 00:41:09,097
We were just
having dinner.

451
00:41:09,099 --> 00:41:10,598
I won't stay long.

452
00:41:14,729 --> 00:41:15,897
Take a seat.

453
00:41:20,735 --> 00:41:22,568
Hello.

454
00:41:22,570 --> 00:41:24,278
Hi.

455
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:26,072
I'm Conor.

456
00:41:26,074 --> 00:41:27,615
I'm a friend
of your uncle's.

457
00:41:27,617 --> 00:41:29,077
Cillian, bedtime.

458
00:41:30,661 --> 00:41:31,913
Now, please.

459
00:41:39,670 --> 00:41:41,420
He's a good-looking boy.

460
00:41:41,422 --> 00:41:43,672
I can see
the resemblance.

461
00:41:43,674 --> 00:41:46,300
I called earlier,
but you weren't in.

462
00:41:46,302 --> 00:41:48,302
Where did you go?

463
00:41:48,304 --> 00:41:49,512
Killiney Hill.

464
00:41:49,514 --> 00:41:51,307
Oh. Nice.

465
00:41:52,683 --> 00:41:55,268
It's good to
see you bonding.

466
00:41:55,270 --> 00:41:58,938
It must be tough at the accommodation
center after the bombing.

467
00:41:58,940 --> 00:42:00,689
At least they
arrested someone.

468
00:42:00,691 --> 00:42:02,691
She didn't act alone.

469
00:42:02,693 --> 00:42:05,987
Well, there's a lot of
anger out there, you know?

470
00:42:05,989 --> 00:42:08,656
Particularly
with the Elimination.

471
00:42:08,658 --> 00:42:10,326
Maybe it's for the best.

472
00:42:12,078 --> 00:42:14,203
Dr. Lyons will
find a cure.

473
00:42:14,205 --> 00:42:16,664
- And what if she can't?
- She needs time.

474
00:42:16,666 --> 00:42:19,750
And one of them gets out, and...
and we're right back there.

475
00:42:19,752 --> 00:42:20,709
We're all in danger.

476
00:42:20,711 --> 00:42:22,755
Not all of us.

477
00:42:25,926 --> 00:42:29,429
It's late.
You need to go.

478
00:42:33,934 --> 00:42:35,851
Can I ask you something?

479
00:42:38,271 --> 00:42:40,440
Do you think
we deserve forgiveness?

480
00:42:42,567 --> 00:42:44,901
Yes.

481
00:42:44,903 --> 00:42:47,072
And if you were faced with the
man that killed your husband..

482
00:42:49,324 --> 00:42:50,909
...would you forgive him?

483
00:42:57,165 --> 00:42:58,791
They weren't in control.

484
00:43:00,751 --> 00:43:01,792
I'd better check
on Cillian.

485
00:43:01,794 --> 00:43:03,419
I'm sorry.

486
00:43:03,421 --> 00:43:05,090
I didn't mean to
upset you.

487
00:43:07,758 --> 00:43:08,676
You didn't.

488
00:43:23,524 --> 00:43:25,691
She takes you in and suddenly
you forget about us?

489
00:43:25,693 --> 00:43:28,861
You told me
they were empty targets.

490
00:43:28,863 --> 00:43:32,698
There's always
casualties, Senan.

491
00:43:32,700 --> 00:43:34,202
We're dying every day
because of them.

492
00:43:37,413 --> 00:43:39,082
I'm not gonna be
a part of this anymore.

493
00:43:40,333 --> 00:43:41,707
I have to look after them.

494
00:43:41,709 --> 00:43:43,042
You think you can
just shut the door

495
00:43:43,044 --> 00:43:44,921
and pretend it's all okay?

496
00:43:48,049 --> 00:43:51,219
You're the reason...
they're not safe.

497
00:43:58,935 --> 00:44:00,603
They'll find out
eventually.

498
00:44:26,629 --> 00:44:28,004
Sweetheart, can you go
and brush your teeth?

499
00:44:28,006 --> 00:44:29,755
I'm gonna be late.

500
00:44:29,757 --> 00:44:31,966
Cillian, now!

501
00:44:31,968 --> 00:44:33,636
I can take him to school.

502
00:44:35,346 --> 00:44:37,513
Uh, you don't know
where it is.

503
00:44:37,515 --> 00:44:38,975
I can show him.

504
00:44:40,936 --> 00:44:42,851
Okay.

505
00:44:42,853 --> 00:44:44,940
Okay, but straight
to school, okay?

506
00:44:51,362 --> 00:44:53,196
- Aah..
- Fall off.

507
00:44:53,198 --> 00:44:54,699
I'd never fall off.

508
00:45:02,123 --> 00:45:04,334
- Aah..
- Yeah.

509
00:45:11,257 --> 00:45:14,592
I just wanted to check to make
sure that he wasn't late.

510
00:45:14,594 --> 00:45:16,928
Yes, thank you. Bye.

511
00:45:21,851 --> 00:45:23,226
What's this about?

512
00:45:23,228 --> 00:45:25,436
It's customary to check in
with families

513
00:45:25,438 --> 00:45:26,356
to see
how everything's going.

514
00:45:28,399 --> 00:45:32,276
So, how is Senan
settling back in?

515
00:45:32,278 --> 00:45:34,112
Well.

516
00:45:34,114 --> 00:45:36,616
It's natural for there
to be problems at first.

517
00:45:38,409 --> 00:45:39,911
Everything's fine.

518
00:45:42,122 --> 00:45:44,582
You know, I have to say..

519
00:45:46,251 --> 00:45:48,918
...I think it's brave
of you

520
00:45:48,920 --> 00:45:50,753
to take one back in.

521
00:45:50,755 --> 00:45:53,297
Especially with a young
boy in the house.

522
00:45:53,299 --> 00:45:55,508
They can be aggressive.

523
00:45:55,510 --> 00:45:56,968
And it probably
doesn't help that their

524
00:45:56,970 --> 00:45:58,596
rehab officer kicks
the shit out of them.

525
00:46:00,515 --> 00:46:03,141
You've met Conor.

526
00:46:03,143 --> 00:46:04,644
The alpha of the pack.

527
00:46:06,021 --> 00:46:09,772
They're friends.
From quarantine.

528
00:46:09,774 --> 00:46:11,359
Is that
what they told you?

529
00:46:20,618 --> 00:46:22,368
We try to make ourselves
feel better

530
00:46:22,370 --> 00:46:25,538
feel safe, by saying
it wasn't their fault.

531
00:46:25,540 --> 00:46:27,500
They're just
mindless monsters.

532
00:46:29,377 --> 00:46:31,046
But the Infected
aren't mindless.

533
00:46:33,048 --> 00:46:34,964
They hunt together.

534
00:46:34,966 --> 00:46:36,507
They communicate
with each other.

535
00:46:36,509 --> 00:46:39,010
They decide who to kill..

536
00:46:39,012 --> 00:46:40,596
...and who to infect.

537
00:46:44,059 --> 00:46:46,727
They're connected in a way
that we will never understand.

538
00:46:49,064 --> 00:46:50,690
What do you want from me?

539
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:54,235
I want you to contact me.

540
00:46:56,362 --> 00:46:58,031
If you think there's
anything I should know.

541
00:48:39,549 --> 00:48:40,798
They're killing
the Resistant

542
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:42,884
because they think
they're a threat.

543
00:48:42,886 --> 00:48:44,969
But they're not
a threat to us.

544
00:48:44,971 --> 00:48:46,932
They're the key
to our freedom.

545
00:48:48,766 --> 00:48:51,059
Now, we're not gonna change
anything by simply crying

546
00:48:51,061 --> 00:48:53,477
and breaking windows
like petulant teenagers.

547
00:48:53,479 --> 00:48:55,646
We need something that
will make them listen.

548
00:48:55,648 --> 00:48:57,106
Something they're truly
scared of.

549
00:48:57,108 --> 00:48:59,358
- Yes! Yes!
- This is our country too.

550
00:48:59,360 --> 00:49:00,693
- Yes. Yes.
- Yes!

551
00:49:07,077 --> 00:49:07,953
Katie.

552
00:49:24,344 --> 00:49:26,135
What are you doing here?

553
00:49:26,137 --> 00:49:27,805
I wanted to see it
for myself.

554
00:49:30,058 --> 00:49:31,726
I thought you might've
come to see me.

555
00:49:37,983 --> 00:49:39,650
Do you want to
ask me something?

556
00:49:41,027 --> 00:49:43,361
You were involved
in the bombings.

557
00:49:43,363 --> 00:49:45,363
You can't link me
to any violence.

558
00:49:45,365 --> 00:49:46,447
So you're denying it?

559
00:49:46,449 --> 00:49:48,241
All I've done is
tried to help people.

560
00:49:48,243 --> 00:49:49,911
It's not just
for the power then?

561
00:49:52,122 --> 00:49:53,748
Now, look at
how they treat us.

562
00:49:55,291 --> 00:49:56,707
Look at how we're
forced to live

563
00:49:56,709 --> 00:49:58,376
what choice do we have?

564
00:49:58,378 --> 00:50:00,962
You have the choice
not to eat people.

565
00:50:00,964 --> 00:50:02,883
Well, there's the thing.

566
00:50:04,050 --> 00:50:05,758
We're not
the only killers.

567
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:07,470
We're just the ones
being reminded of it.

568
00:50:09,305 --> 00:50:11,057
I want you to stay away
from me.

569
00:50:12,976 --> 00:50:14,644
And stay away from Senan.

570
00:50:17,981 --> 00:50:20,899
Senan... is my family...

571
00:50:20,901 --> 00:50:23,651
Why? Because
you killed together?

572
00:50:23,653 --> 00:50:26,195
'Cause you're a pack?

573
00:50:26,197 --> 00:50:27,991
That's not a family,
it's a sickness.

574
00:50:30,035 --> 00:50:31,953
He wouldn't have
told you that.

575
00:50:33,371 --> 00:50:34,872
Stay away from us.

576
00:51:15,455 --> 00:51:17,455
Elimination of
level one complete.

577
00:51:17,457 --> 00:51:19,459
Moving all remaining Resistant
to the holding area.

578
00:51:47,403 --> 00:51:48,279
Jo?

579
00:52:05,713 --> 00:52:06,631
My love?

580
00:52:10,551 --> 00:52:11,677
It's me.

581
00:52:29,070 --> 00:52:30,071
No!

582
00:52:35,243 --> 00:52:36,244
What are you doing?

583
00:52:38,871 --> 00:52:40,955
She's being brought to the
rest for euthanization.

584
00:52:40,957 --> 00:52:42,292
I can save her!

585
00:52:43,626 --> 00:52:45,253
Please, no!

586
00:52:50,258 --> 00:52:52,050
- Done.
- What am I?

587
00:52:52,052 --> 00:52:53,303
A dog.

588
00:52:53,970 --> 00:52:55,805
You're gonna love this.

589
00:52:57,223 --> 00:52:58,973
I look a bit more
like a gerbil.

590
00:52:58,975 --> 00:53:01,809
- No, you look like a dog.
- I look like a hamster.

591
00:53:01,811 --> 00:53:02,977
- And it's all your fault.
- You look like a dog.

592
00:53:02,979 --> 00:53:04,395
It's all your fault.

593
00:53:04,397 --> 00:53:06,105
...windows like
petulant teenagers.

594
00:53:06,107 --> 00:53:08,232
We need something that
will make them listen.

595
00:53:08,234 --> 00:53:10,151
We need to make ourselves
heard properly.

596
00:53:10,153 --> 00:53:11,986
- Yes!
- This is our country too.

597
00:53:11,988 --> 00:53:15,283
Yes!

598
00:54:35,280 --> 00:54:37,280
- You okay?
- Yeah.

599
00:54:37,282 --> 00:54:38,491
Sorry, just on edge.

600
00:54:40,160 --> 00:54:42,451
You look ridiculous.

601
00:54:42,453 --> 00:54:44,830
Yeah.
I'll go wash it off.

602
00:54:55,800 --> 00:54:58,009
I'm so used to doing this
on my own.

603
00:54:58,011 --> 00:55:00,136
It's so weird
having someone here.

604
00:55:00,138 --> 00:55:01,014
Yeah.

605
00:55:05,894 --> 00:55:07,562
When Cillian was born,
Luke was petrified.

606
00:55:09,898 --> 00:55:12,606
Well, it wasn't
exactly planned, so..

607
00:55:12,608 --> 00:55:13,526
Hmm.

608
00:55:17,197 --> 00:55:20,698
He said it was like somebody put
his heart inside somebody else.

609
00:55:20,700 --> 00:55:21,699
Christ.

610
00:55:22,743 --> 00:55:24,662
He could be
so pretentious.

611
00:55:29,750 --> 00:55:31,252
He'd be happy
you're here.

612
00:55:44,640 --> 00:55:46,059
Cured scum!

613
00:55:49,687 --> 00:55:50,563
Luke..

614
00:55:58,905 --> 00:56:00,573
Was there any
distinctive features?

615
00:56:02,825 --> 00:56:05,745
No. Just the anti-Cured
symbol.

616
00:56:07,914 --> 00:56:09,956
Did they say anythin'?

617
00:56:09,958 --> 00:56:10,833
No.

618
00:56:12,502 --> 00:56:14,335
We'll do everything
we can to catch them

619
00:56:14,337 --> 00:56:17,088
but, uh,
this sort of thing

620
00:56:17,090 --> 00:56:19,759
it's not uncommon
in homes with..

621
00:56:21,594 --> 00:56:22,637
Eh..

622
00:56:24,347 --> 00:56:27,517
- You can say Cured.
- E... exactly. Yes.

623
00:56:45,410 --> 00:56:46,494
You were right.

624
00:56:48,329 --> 00:56:49,495
I can't keep them safe.

625
00:56:51,082 --> 00:56:52,375
I need your help.

626
00:56:55,086 --> 00:56:56,754
They'll never
leave us alone.

627
00:57:00,258 --> 00:57:02,093
We need something that
will make them listen.

628
00:57:22,655 --> 00:57:23,988
Sergeant Cantor.

629
00:57:23,990 --> 00:57:25,491
It's about Conor.

630
00:57:26,993 --> 00:57:28,661
I think he's planning
something.

631
00:57:35,668 --> 00:57:36,752
Dr. Lyons?

632
00:57:40,256 --> 00:57:41,505
What's goin' on?

633
00:57:41,507 --> 00:57:43,632
I asked her to come.

634
00:57:43,634 --> 00:57:44,802
Sit down.

635
00:57:53,853 --> 00:57:54,938
They took Jo.

636
00:57:56,272 --> 00:57:57,855
We're gonna save her,
Senan.

637
00:57:57,857 --> 00:57:59,523
If we have
one of the Resistant

638
00:57:59,525 --> 00:58:01,692
they'll have to
take us seriously.

639
00:58:01,694 --> 00:58:03,363
No more bombings,
no more violence.

640
00:58:08,994 --> 00:58:10,912
What about the military?

641
00:58:11,704 --> 00:58:12,914
Mm?

642
00:58:14,540 --> 00:58:15,748
People could get killed.

643
00:58:15,750 --> 00:58:18,042
It's mainly
defense volunteers left.

644
00:58:18,044 --> 00:58:19,585
Scouts have
better trainin'.

645
00:58:19,587 --> 00:58:21,047
You don't know what the
fuck you're talkin' about.

646
00:58:26,552 --> 00:58:29,929
Joan, you can't agree
with this.

647
00:58:29,931 --> 00:58:32,058
I have to save her,
Senan.

648
00:58:33,684 --> 00:58:35,935
They're the same as us.

649
00:58:35,937 --> 00:58:38,064
We can't stand by
and do nothing.

650
00:58:56,791 --> 00:58:57,999
Get off, get off!

651
00:58:58,001 --> 00:58:59,752
Run! Run, run, run, run!

652
00:59:02,338 --> 00:59:03,671
Move, move, move!

653
00:59:03,673 --> 00:59:05,173
Senan, come on!

654
00:59:05,175 --> 00:59:07,633
Where are they?
Down. Get down.

655
00:59:07,635 --> 00:59:08,842
- Get down. I said stay down.
- And the rest of them.

656
00:59:08,844 --> 00:59:11,637
Get up against the wall!

657
00:59:11,639 --> 00:59:12,763
Go look in the basement,
there are more in there.

658
00:59:12,765 --> 00:59:14,640
Where are they off to?
Where are they going?

659
00:59:14,642 --> 00:59:15,518
Where?

660
00:59:47,717 --> 00:59:49,385
I told you
to stay away from us.

661
00:59:50,887 --> 00:59:53,346
Senan told me
about the break-in.

662
00:59:53,348 --> 00:59:55,016
I wanted to make sure
you were okay.

663
00:59:56,267 --> 00:59:57,602
I know it was you.

664
01:00:03,066 --> 01:00:04,607
You know,
for a while there

665
01:00:04,609 --> 01:00:08,736
I thought you and I,
that we had something.

666
01:00:08,738 --> 01:00:10,949
But it turns out you're
just like everybody else.

667
01:00:11,574 --> 01:00:12,617
Scared.

668
01:00:14,285 --> 01:00:16,204
And the truth is,
you're right to be scared.

669
01:00:18,831 --> 01:00:22,333
No matter how much
we pretend..

670
01:00:22,335 --> 01:00:24,004
...we're not
the same people anymore.

671
01:00:31,427 --> 01:00:34,139
All because daddy
wouldn't get you a job.

672
01:00:39,352 --> 01:00:41,479
You know,
I met your husband once.

673
01:00:45,108 --> 01:00:46,526
Bless him,
he tried his best.

674
01:00:47,860 --> 01:00:49,195
You're lying.

675
01:00:51,197 --> 01:00:53,656
You should ask
Senan about him.

676
01:00:53,658 --> 01:00:55,160
It's all very
Cain and Abel.

677
01:01:18,391 --> 01:01:19,267
No!

678
01:01:21,727 --> 01:01:23,271
Senan?

679
01:01:29,610 --> 01:01:31,277
Where's Conor?

680
01:01:32,863 --> 01:01:34,115
What's he planning?

681
01:01:35,783 --> 01:01:37,909
Senan?

682
01:01:37,911 --> 01:01:40,580
He doesn't care
about you.

683
01:01:44,542 --> 01:01:47,795
- He looked after me.
- He infected you!

684
01:01:50,506 --> 01:01:53,009
You have to give me
something.

685
01:01:54,302 --> 01:01:55,969
Before it's too late.

686
01:01:55,971 --> 01:01:58,012
Before the withdrawal
is over.

687
01:01:59,140 --> 01:02:00,514
Time's up.

688
01:02:05,021 --> 01:02:06,522
I can help.

689
01:02:07,941 --> 01:02:10,026
I can help your family.

690
01:02:13,529 --> 01:02:16,116
Isn't that what
Luke would want?

691
01:02:27,043 --> 01:02:28,336
Conor needs to see ya.

692
01:02:29,880 --> 01:02:30,881
Hey.

693
01:02:33,258 --> 01:02:34,382
12 o'clock.

694
01:02:34,384 --> 01:02:35,510
The baths.

695
01:02:53,444 --> 01:02:54,529
Hey.

696
01:02:58,449 --> 01:02:59,534
I'm sorry
I didn't come home.

697
01:03:04,039 --> 01:03:05,123
What's wrong?

698
01:03:19,429 --> 01:03:20,680
What happened to Luke?

699
01:03:30,023 --> 01:03:31,357
How did he die?

700
01:03:37,030 --> 01:03:38,698
- Abbie..
- Tell me.

701
01:03:48,374 --> 01:03:50,210
I thought it would be better
if you didn't know the truth.

702
01:04:09,854 --> 01:04:10,939
What happened?

703
01:04:14,109 --> 01:04:15,610
- What good will it do?
- Tell me!

704
01:04:22,783 --> 01:04:23,618
We were here.

705
01:04:28,831 --> 01:04:29,749
We..

706
01:04:33,461 --> 01:04:35,879
Luke thought that..

707
01:04:35,881 --> 01:04:38,131
...maybe you'd been
trapped here.

708
01:04:38,133 --> 01:04:40,218
But you'd already gone
by the time we got here.

709
01:04:44,472 --> 01:04:45,932
Then there was
an Infected.

710
01:04:48,143 --> 01:04:49,477
And he attacked me.

711
01:04:52,188 --> 01:04:53,023
Conor.

712
01:04:56,484 --> 01:04:57,610
Yeah.

713
01:05:02,198 --> 01:05:03,866
Luke tried
to fight him off.

714
01:05:06,827 --> 01:05:08,121
But it was too late.

715
01:05:15,003 --> 01:05:17,380
And then he barricaded
himself in the bedroom.

716
01:05:24,888 --> 01:05:27,055
I wasn't in control.

717
01:05:27,057 --> 01:05:30,183
Believe me,
I... I didn't know

718
01:05:30,185 --> 01:05:31,850
what I was doing, and...

719
01:05:31,852 --> 01:05:33,729
How could you not tell me?

720
01:05:35,690 --> 01:05:38,274
How could you sleep here?

721
01:05:38,276 --> 01:05:40,776
- I'm so sorry...
- Get out!

722
01:05:40,778 --> 01:05:42,530
Get the fuck out!

723
01:05:43,573 --> 01:05:44,613
Get the fuck out!

724
01:06:41,131 --> 01:06:42,382
I had to show you.

725
01:06:45,051 --> 01:06:46,887
They're all the same
when they know the truth.

726
01:06:49,890 --> 01:06:51,557
I'm your real family,
Senan.

727
01:06:57,230 --> 01:06:59,730
You never had
any nightmares, did you?

728
01:06:59,732 --> 01:07:00,816
Why should I?

729
01:07:01,902 --> 01:07:03,317
This is Sergeant Cantor.

730
01:07:03,319 --> 01:07:05,153
I need back-up
at the baths.

731
01:07:07,240 --> 01:07:09,365
On your knees,
hands on your head.

732
01:07:09,367 --> 01:07:11,784
Understood.
We're on our way.

733
01:07:11,786 --> 01:07:13,454
We will be
with you shortly.

734
01:07:17,959 --> 01:07:19,085
Get down.

735
01:07:20,378 --> 01:07:21,462
Now.

736
01:07:35,643 --> 01:07:37,643
I'm arresting you
for the murder

737
01:07:37,645 --> 01:07:39,314
of Cadet Jack Dermody.

738
01:07:41,649 --> 01:07:42,984
I did tell you, Conor.

739
01:07:44,903 --> 01:07:46,947
It's not your world
any more.

740
01:07:51,159 --> 01:07:52,285
Cuff yourself.

741
01:08:01,669 --> 01:08:02,877
Conor!

742
01:08:04,547 --> 01:08:06,630
Conor! Stop! Stop!

743
01:08:25,401 --> 01:08:26,569
Why?

744
01:08:28,404 --> 01:08:29,737
Why?

745
01:08:35,327 --> 01:08:36,995
I can't let you
go through with it.

746
01:08:38,956 --> 01:08:40,248
People will get hurt.

747
01:08:41,458 --> 01:08:43,042
I told you..

748
01:08:43,044 --> 01:08:45,296
...there's always
casualties.

749
01:08:47,798 --> 01:08:49,130
What're you planning?

750
01:08:49,132 --> 01:08:50,799
Conor.

751
01:08:50,801 --> 01:08:52,758
What're you
really planning?

752
01:08:52,760 --> 01:08:54,635
It's already done.

753
01:09:23,709 --> 01:09:25,628
The Cured on route.

754
01:09:26,712 --> 01:09:28,212
Understood.

755
01:09:28,214 --> 01:09:29,340
Copy that.

756
01:10:05,251 --> 01:10:06,920
Where's the control room?

757
01:10:13,300 --> 01:10:14,467
Come on.

758
01:11:01,473 --> 01:11:02,557
There she is.

759
01:11:12,027 --> 01:11:13,485
Come on, hurry up,
will you?

760
01:11:24,414 --> 01:11:25,747
What are you doing?

761
01:11:30,086 --> 01:11:31,501
This isn't the plan,
please.

762
01:11:31,503 --> 01:11:32,587
Yes, it is.

763
01:11:38,010 --> 01:11:40,680
- Look, this is madness.
- I told you to shut up.

764
01:11:55,611 --> 01:11:56,487
Oh, God!

765
01:12:34,734 --> 01:12:36,025
They're through,
they're through.

766
01:12:36,027 --> 01:12:37,403
They're pouring through!

767
01:13:57,317 --> 01:13:59,192
The fence is down!
The fence is down!

768
01:13:59,194 --> 01:14:00,650
The perimeter
has been breached!

769
01:14:00,652 --> 01:14:02,737
The fence is down. I need
some back-up over here!

770
01:14:38,608 --> 01:14:40,276
Welcome home, my love.

771
01:15:08,513 --> 01:15:10,265
No! No!

772
01:16:03,443 --> 01:16:04,945
Get in. Get in.

773
01:16:08,364 --> 01:16:10,114
- Okay, everyone..
- Get on the truck.

774
01:16:10,116 --> 01:16:11,406
Start making your way
onto the truck. Go.

775
01:16:11,408 --> 01:16:12,616
What's going on
with the schools?

776
01:16:12,618 --> 01:16:13,826
The schools
are being evacuated.

777
01:16:13,828 --> 01:16:15,244
No, no, I have to get
to my son. Please.

778
01:16:15,246 --> 01:16:16,745
All the kids
will be at the stadium.

779
01:16:16,747 --> 01:16:18,288
- I have to get to my son...
- Ma'am, you need..

780
01:16:23,463 --> 01:16:25,754
Get on the truck!
We've got to move!

781
01:16:25,756 --> 01:16:26,922
Get on the truck now!
Get on, quick!

782
01:16:26,924 --> 01:16:28,800
I've got to find my son!

783
01:16:30,511 --> 01:16:32,013
Get Cillian!

784
01:16:33,180 --> 01:16:34,139
Get Cillian!

785
01:16:34,640 --> 01:16:35,766
Get out!

786
01:17:27,609 --> 01:17:28,943
Hurry, hurry, hurry!
Let's go, let's go!

787
01:17:28,945 --> 01:17:29,777
Let's go, come on!

788
01:17:33,740 --> 01:17:35,615
Cillian!

789
01:17:37,578 --> 01:17:38,953
Cillian!

790
01:17:43,625 --> 01:17:44,626
Senan!

791
01:17:46,421 --> 01:17:48,087
- Senan!
- Hey, hey.

792
01:17:48,089 --> 01:17:49,132
Come here. Come here.

793
01:17:51,092 --> 01:17:53,176
Come on, I've got you.
I've got you.

794
01:17:53,178 --> 01:17:54,928
I've got you, come on.

795
01:17:54,930 --> 01:17:56,347
It's okay. It's okay.

796
01:17:59,350 --> 01:18:00,683
Please keep calm.

797
01:18:00,685 --> 01:18:02,767
If you are cured,
stay outside

798
01:18:02,769 --> 01:18:04,019
the perimeter fence.

799
01:18:04,021 --> 01:18:05,980
You are safe.
There is no room...

800
01:18:05,982 --> 01:18:07,606
Please let me in. How
do you know we're safe?

801
01:18:09,194 --> 01:18:10,318
Have the schools come yet?

802
01:18:10,320 --> 01:18:11,694
Walk through.

803
01:19:00,245 --> 01:19:01,952
He's just a boy.

804
01:19:03,539 --> 01:19:04,914
Run!

805
01:19:20,015 --> 01:19:21,139
Did you really think
you could betray me

806
01:19:21,141 --> 01:19:22,265
like that?

807
01:19:24,019 --> 01:19:25,350
Did you?

808
01:19:33,528 --> 01:19:34,859
Check your right.
Move, move, move.

809
01:19:34,861 --> 01:19:36,363
Let's go!
Get out! Come on!

810
01:19:38,490 --> 01:19:39,364
I was the only one
who really cared

811
01:19:39,366 --> 01:19:40,991
about you.

812
01:19:40,993 --> 01:19:43,953
I took care of you.

813
01:20:43,598 --> 01:20:44,640
Senan!

814
01:21:06,954 --> 01:21:08,871
Hey.

815
01:21:08,873 --> 01:21:09,957
You okay?

816
01:21:20,467 --> 01:21:21,551
Check the east side.

817
01:21:23,638 --> 01:21:25,891
Kill on sight.
Containment is priority.

818
01:21:28,059 --> 01:21:29,224
Guard down!

819
01:21:34,356 --> 01:21:35,275
Clear!

820
01:21:42,073 --> 01:21:44,698
Listen, there's
nothing wrong with her.

821
01:21:44,700 --> 01:21:47,035
- Look at her..
- He's my husband, he's..

822
01:21:47,037 --> 01:21:48,577
You can't treat
people like this.

823
01:21:48,579 --> 01:21:49,954
Why are they being
separated?

824
01:21:53,584 --> 01:21:55,625
Just let her through!

825
01:21:55,627 --> 01:21:57,295
I'm not infected.

826
01:21:57,297 --> 01:21:59,422
Why are they separated?
Why are they separated?

827
01:21:59,424 --> 01:22:00,466
Get out of my way!

828
01:22:02,552 --> 01:22:03,801
You have no right
to separate them

829
01:22:03,803 --> 01:22:04,885
they're not infected.

830
01:22:04,887 --> 01:22:06,138
Madam, calm down.

831
01:22:07,807 --> 01:22:09,432
Now everybody
needs to calm down!

832
01:22:12,812 --> 01:22:14,103
Come on, come on. Move.

833
01:22:14,105 --> 01:22:15,563
Move it! Move it!
Move it! Move it!

834
01:24:27,363 --> 01:24:28,737
Cillian?

835
01:24:32,910 --> 01:24:33,828
Cillian?

836
01:24:35,287 --> 01:24:36,121
Cillian.

837
01:25:03,315 --> 01:25:04,484
Mum!

838
01:25:06,486 --> 01:25:08,318
Oh, my.. Oh!

839
01:25:08,320 --> 01:25:09,403
I love you!

840
01:25:09,405 --> 01:25:10,281
Oh!

841
01:25:41,353 --> 01:25:43,023
You're gonna be okay.

842
01:25:46,151 --> 01:25:47,732
You're gonna be okay.

843
01:25:51,907 --> 01:25:53,072
I love you!

844
01:25:53,074 --> 01:25:54,200
Abbie.

845
01:26:01,582 --> 01:26:02,918
I love you.

846
01:26:03,584 --> 01:26:05,336
Stop! It's okay.

847
01:26:07,547 --> 01:26:08,922
There's a cure.

848
01:26:10,967 --> 01:26:12,550
He doesn't have to be
like me.

849
01:26:15,555 --> 01:26:16,932
Lyons found a cure.

850
01:26:19,559 --> 01:26:20,810
I can save him.

851
01:26:26,899 --> 01:26:27,982
Abbie.

852
01:26:35,325 --> 01:26:36,408
I love you.

853
01:26:38,328 --> 01:26:39,953
I love you.

854
01:26:39,955 --> 01:26:41,620
I love you, little..

855
01:26:41,622 --> 01:26:43,622
I love you. No..

856
01:26:45,251 --> 01:26:46,625
He's gonna be okay,
I promise.

857
01:26:46,627 --> 01:26:47,667
I promise.

858
01:27:27,252 --> 01:27:28,751
Following the recent
outbreak of the Maze

859
01:27:28,753 --> 01:27:30,710
virus in Ireland,
the country is beginning

860
01:27:30,712 --> 01:27:32,881
to regain control
once again.

861
01:27:32,883 --> 01:27:34,339
People are desperately
trying to track down

862
01:27:34,341 --> 01:27:36,466
loved ones, suspected
to be amongst the 8000

863
01:27:36,468 --> 01:27:37,968
newly Infected cases..

864
01:27:37,970 --> 01:27:40,429
Outcry against the humane
elimination is growing

865
01:27:40,431 --> 01:27:42,222
with families joining
the Cured Alliance who

866
01:27:42,224 --> 01:27:43,807
are leading the protests
against the government.

867
01:27:43,809 --> 01:27:45,059
The government
have agreed that

868
01:27:45,061 --> 01:27:46,476
continuing
the humane elimination

869
01:27:46,478 --> 01:27:48,312
is the only option
available

870
01:27:48,314 --> 01:27:49,479
if we are going to
stamp out this infection

871
01:27:49,481 --> 01:27:50,814
once and for all.

872
01:27:50,816 --> 01:27:52,316
..the government
are preparing to declare

873
01:27:52,318 --> 01:27:53,819
Ireland Infection free.

874
01:27:57,782 --> 01:27:59,323
We've obtained evidence
that a cure

875
01:27:59,325 --> 01:28:00,658
for the resistant strain
was perfected

876
01:28:00,660 --> 01:28:02,826
by Doctor Joan Lyons.

877
01:28:02,828 --> 01:28:04,453
Now, either
the government knew this

878
01:28:04,455 --> 01:28:06,414
and covered it up,
or they rushed

879
01:28:06,416 --> 01:28:07,665
into the
clean-up missions

880
01:28:07,667 --> 01:28:09,458
without considering
any options.

881
01:28:09,460 --> 01:28:11,169
The people of Ireland
deserve better

882
01:28:11,171 --> 01:28:12,420
they deserve
true leadership

883
01:28:12,422 --> 01:28:14,254
that is there
for the many and not...

884
01:28:14,256 --> 01:28:15,339
Sorry, we have
to interrupt here.

885
01:28:15,341 --> 01:28:17,591
We're receiving
breaking news.

886
01:28:17,593 --> 01:28:19,509
Despite reports,
camera traps

887
01:28:19,511 --> 01:28:21,720
have discovered pockets
of Infected still

888
01:28:21,722 --> 01:28:23,138
remaining in the west
of the country.

889
01:28:23,140 --> 01:28:25,640
The footage shows
at least 20 infected

890
01:28:25,642 --> 01:28:26,809
but the exact figures
have yet

891
01:28:26,811 --> 01:28:28,227
to be determined.

892
01:28:28,229 --> 01:28:30,188
The government has just
released a statement

893
01:28:30,190 --> 01:28:32,481
assuring those in
the area that a military

894
01:28:32,483 --> 01:28:34,067
platoon will be
dispatched

895
01:28:34,069 --> 01:28:35,693
to evacuate them.

896
01:28:35,695 --> 01:28:36,902
Now this begs
the question

897
01:28:36,904 --> 01:28:39,238
if the military failed
to detect these Infected

898
01:28:39,240 --> 01:28:40,823
how many more of them..
