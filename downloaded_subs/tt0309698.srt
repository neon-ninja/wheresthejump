1
00:00:16,193 --> 00:00:20,094
As I was going up the stair

2
00:00:20,263 --> 00:00:22,064
I met a man who wasn't there

3
00:00:22,065 --> 00:00:24,464
I met a man who wasn't there

4
00:00:26,002 --> 00:00:29,129
He wasn't there again today

5
00:00:31,709 --> 00:00:35,474
I wish
I wish he'd go away

6
00:00:36,414 --> 00:00:38,608
Where did you learn that?

7
00:00:39,817 --> 00:00:42,148
Where did you learn that poem?

8
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:44,685
I made it up.

9
00:00:44,854 --> 00:00:48,289
When I was a kid, I made it up.

10
00:00:51,861 --> 00:00:55,092
What else do you remember
from back then?

11
00:01:00,204 --> 00:01:03,695
Don't beat around the bush, doc.
Don't beat around the bush.

12
00:01:03,874 --> 00:01:08,901
Don't beat around the bush.
Don't beat around the bush, doc!

13
00:01:10,081 --> 00:01:14,517
Tell me what you remember
about your mother.

14
00:01:15,852 --> 00:01:17,341
I remember my mom.

15
00:01:18,822 --> 00:01:20,686
I remember my mom.

16
00:01:22,893 --> 00:01:24,883
I remember my mom was a whore.

17
00:01:34,872 --> 00:01:37,840
How long would she keep you there?

18
00:01:39,909 --> 00:01:43,071
As long as she was busy.

19
00:01:56,994 --> 00:02:00,224
Do you understand
why you're talking with me now?

20
00:02:00,398 --> 00:02:02,058
You're supposed to be good with...

21
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:04,388
...headaches.

22
00:02:06,269 --> 00:02:09,135
I need something more than aspirin.
Know what I mean?

23
00:02:09,305 --> 00:02:13,332
Do you remember the murders?

24
00:02:15,179 --> 00:02:17,271
I remember...

25
00:02:17,982 --> 00:02:21,610
...that Columbia is the capital
of South Carolina.

26
00:02:24,121 --> 00:02:25,747
I remember that...

27
00:02:36,566 --> 00:02:39,364
Are you the person
who murdered six residents...

28
00:02:39,537 --> 00:02:43,028
...of the Lakeworth Apartments
on May 10, 1998?

29
00:02:47,778 --> 00:02:50,041
That's my birthday.

30
00:02:55,518 --> 00:02:57,542
Who am I speaking to right now?

31
00:03:00,056 --> 00:03:02,751
What should I call you?

32
00:03:04,027 --> 00:03:07,258
Call me whatever you want.

33
00:03:17,841 --> 00:03:19,603
Gary?

34
00:03:19,776 --> 00:03:21,504
Gary?

35
00:03:22,078 --> 00:03:24,102
Gary, you awake?

36
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:27,771
Yes, Greg, as a matter of fact,
I am awake.

37
00:03:27,951 --> 00:03:29,747
I'm sorry to bother you at home...

38
00:03:29,919 --> 00:03:33,184
...but there's gonna be a midnight
hearing in the Rivers case.

39
00:03:33,357 --> 00:03:37,258
The defense found a notebook
misfiled in evidence, a diary.

40
00:03:37,428 --> 00:03:40,328
They argued to the state Supremes
that it was suppressed.

41
00:03:41,232 --> 00:03:42,960
What are you talking about?

42
00:03:43,133 --> 00:03:46,431
There's no media.
This all happened under the radar.

43
00:03:46,603 --> 00:03:49,036
The prisoner transport
left an hour ago from Ely.

44
00:03:49,205 --> 00:03:52,367
Left Ely? What do you mean?
What transport?

45
00:03:52,542 --> 00:03:55,374
The diary gave them an opening
to argue insanity again.

46
00:03:55,545 --> 00:03:58,981
They need Rivers present, so they
drugged him, put him on a transport.

47
00:03:59,150 --> 00:04:01,310
They're taking this scumbag
to a hearing...

48
00:04:01,485 --> 00:04:03,315
...the night before his execution.

49
00:04:03,487 --> 00:04:05,716
How the fuck did you let that happen?

50
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:12,725
Would anyone like to play
another round?

51
00:04:14,063 --> 00:04:16,792
Let's get another puzzle,
Vanna. What do we have?

52
00:04:16,966 --> 00:04:19,399
- "Around the House" is the category.
- Buy a vowel.

53
00:04:19,569 --> 00:04:21,399
- Buy a vowel.
- Pick up that trip.

54
00:04:22,105 --> 00:04:25,700
- Buy a vowel, you idiot.
- I'd like to buy a vowel. An E.

55
00:04:26,243 --> 00:04:28,267
One E.

56
00:04:28,445 --> 00:04:31,845
- All right, 350 left.
- N.

57
00:04:32,783 --> 00:04:34,443
- Buy a vowel.
- Buy another vowel.

58
00:04:34,617 --> 00:04:36,516
- Yes!
- An I.

59
00:04:42,492 --> 00:04:43,981
- I'd like to solve.
- Sure.

60
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:45,626
"Kibbles 'n Bits."

61
00:04:49,967 --> 00:04:52,662
She won't stop bleeding.
She won't stop bleeding.

62
00:04:52,837 --> 00:04:57,170
- Jesus. What happened?
- An accident. We had an accident.

63
00:04:57,341 --> 00:04:59,501
Rain and lightning
is moving into Elko.

64
00:04:59,676 --> 00:05:03,111
Doppler Radar has picked up a
severe thunderstorm with lightning...

65
00:05:03,279 --> 00:05:05,678
...on its way from Pershing
and Lander counties.

66
00:05:05,849 --> 00:05:08,612
- We could get damaging winds...
- Four times 10 equals...

67
00:05:08,785 --> 00:05:10,046
Four times 10...

68
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:14,383
Timothy, could you not do that now?
We're trying to hear about the storm.

69
00:05:15,926 --> 00:05:18,189
- Sure you don't want me to drive?
- No.

70
00:05:18,362 --> 00:05:23,094
I'll get us to Anderson,
then you can take over after we eat.

71
00:05:26,669 --> 00:05:28,932
Turn into spin.

72
00:05:30,974 --> 00:05:33,441
Apply brakes with short, firm pumps.

73
00:05:33,610 --> 00:05:37,204
Check mirror and gauge indicator
and roll...

74
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:41,077
...to a slow, smooth stop.

75
00:05:41,252 --> 00:05:43,344
You okay, honey? Timothy?

76
00:05:46,891 --> 00:05:50,087
Seat belts, seat belts, seat belts.

77
00:05:56,232 --> 00:05:57,892
- It's a shoe.
- What?

78
00:05:58,067 --> 00:06:00,364
It's a shoe!

79
00:06:17,854 --> 00:06:21,414
For he's a jolly good fellow

80
00:06:21,591 --> 00:06:26,220
For he's a jolly good fellow

81
00:06:26,396 --> 00:06:32,858
For he's a jolly good fellow

82
00:06:34,939 --> 00:06:41,400
Which nobody can deny

83
00:06:53,256 --> 00:06:55,018
Shit!

84
00:07:00,397 --> 00:07:04,799
- Why didn't we get a better spare?
- Do you know what radials cost, Alice?

85
00:07:04,969 --> 00:07:06,526
Honey, don't get defensive.

86
00:07:06,737 --> 00:07:10,297
Well, if the point is to put him,
Timothy, into the right school...

87
00:07:10,473 --> 00:07:12,804
...it's absurd to focus...
- George? George?

88
00:07:12,976 --> 00:07:15,500
...on replacement tires.
- What can I do to help?

89
00:07:15,678 --> 00:07:19,443
Nothing. I'm fine, but...

90
00:07:19,916 --> 00:07:21,974
...thank you.

91
00:07:50,247 --> 00:07:53,704
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God! Alice?

92
00:07:54,785 --> 00:07:59,346
Oh, my God! Alice?
What have you done?

93
00:08:00,323 --> 00:08:04,053
What have you done?
What have you done?

94
00:08:06,729 --> 00:08:09,993
Hi, Harry.
Where do I begin?

95
00:08:10,166 --> 00:08:13,191
I have walked off the set, okay?

96
00:08:13,369 --> 00:08:15,529
I know they'll say
that I am in breach...

97
00:08:15,705 --> 00:08:18,640
...but they clearly
did not read my deal.

98
00:08:18,809 --> 00:08:21,106
They had me at a Ramada...

99
00:08:24,947 --> 00:08:26,971
Oh, Jesus.

100
00:08:27,483 --> 00:08:30,042
I think I have a spare battery
in my bag.

101
00:08:30,219 --> 00:08:31,446
Excuse me?

102
00:08:31,621 --> 00:08:35,681
I have a spare battery in my bag
up front, next to you.

103
00:08:35,858 --> 00:08:41,318
- Any idea which one, Miss Suzanne?
- The Louis Vuitton duffel, right on top.

104
00:08:46,103 --> 00:08:47,467
I don't see anything...

105
00:08:47,638 --> 00:08:51,801
Just use your fucking eyes!
It's in the side pocket! Just look!

106
00:08:51,974 --> 00:08:53,235
Jesus!

107
00:09:01,951 --> 00:09:05,215
What have you done?
What have you done?

108
00:09:05,388 --> 00:09:08,755
No, fool! If you help him,
you assume responsibility.

109
00:09:09,059 --> 00:09:11,458
It is my responsibility.
Let go of me.

110
00:09:12,362 --> 00:09:14,261
Alice? Alice?

111
00:09:14,430 --> 00:09:16,624
What have you done?
What have you done?

112
00:09:16,999 --> 00:09:19,558
Let me take a look.

113
00:09:19,735 --> 00:09:24,034
The driver of every motor vehicle
involved in any manner of accident...

114
00:09:24,207 --> 00:09:28,006
...originating from the operation
of a vehicle shall, within 10 days...

115
00:09:28,177 --> 00:09:30,508
You got a towel or something
in the car?

116
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:33,375
Okay. Come help me look.

117
00:09:34,418 --> 00:09:36,510
- Within 10 days of the accident...

118
00:09:36,687 --> 00:09:41,020
...if you are operating a vehicle
and it should, at any time, involve...

119
00:09:41,190 --> 00:09:45,455
- Stay here. Keep her dry.
- It's okay. It's okay, honey.

120
00:09:46,496 --> 00:09:48,861
- Open the door! We need the phone.
- No!

121
00:09:49,832 --> 00:09:51,662
Sweetheart, it's okay.

122
00:09:51,834 --> 00:09:53,562
Honey, it's okay.

123
00:09:56,239 --> 00:09:59,766
- Give me the goddamn phone!
- The phone is dead, all right?

124
00:09:59,943 --> 00:10:04,379
You're gonna be fine.
You're gonna be okay.

125
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:12,946
No!

126
00:10:34,477 --> 00:10:36,910
- She won't stop bleeding.
- Jesus. What happened?

127
00:10:37,079 --> 00:10:39,876
There was an accident.
May I please use your phone?

128
00:10:40,049 --> 00:10:43,108
- Please use your phone?
- Yeah, sure.

129
00:10:45,922 --> 00:10:49,687
Shit. I'm not getting a line.
It happens in the rain.

130
00:10:49,859 --> 00:10:51,052
The phone doesn't work.

131
00:10:51,227 --> 00:10:54,219
St. Jude's has 24-hour emergency,
30 miles east.

132
00:10:55,232 --> 00:10:56,391
Okay.

133
00:10:58,467 --> 00:11:00,593
You sit here, okay?

134
00:11:01,871 --> 00:11:04,930
Keep pressure on the wound.
I'll be back with an ambulance.

135
00:11:15,284 --> 00:11:16,875
What are you doing?

136
00:11:17,053 --> 00:11:20,318
Sorry. It's a step down
from the Ramada, but it'll have to do.

137
00:11:20,490 --> 00:11:22,480
I am not staying here.
Are you out of your mind?

138
00:11:22,658 --> 00:11:27,458
This is my car. You work for me.
Get those bags back in this car now!

139
00:11:29,031 --> 00:11:34,058
I understand the bleeding person
has a medical condition, but so do I.

140
00:11:34,237 --> 00:11:39,731
My lung walls have depleted cilia.
If I stay here, I could asphyxiate!

141
00:11:44,014 --> 00:11:47,676
No, please, please, please,
please, please, please.

142
00:11:48,417 --> 00:11:50,247
Please!

143
00:11:57,627 --> 00:11:58,957
Hey!

144
00:12:04,533 --> 00:12:06,227
Stop. Please, please.

145
00:12:09,706 --> 00:12:13,300
Hi. I'm sorry, my car is stuck.
Can I get a ride?

146
00:12:13,476 --> 00:12:15,272
Okay.

147
00:12:33,329 --> 00:12:35,388
You know you're going east.

148
00:12:36,233 --> 00:12:38,530
Hospital's this way.

149
00:12:39,735 --> 00:12:43,966
It's flooded.
I mean, it's a dead end.

150
00:12:44,307 --> 00:12:47,742
Yeah, well, if you don't mind,
I gotta try.

151
00:12:53,382 --> 00:12:56,839
Okay, that will be $30 cash, please.

152
00:13:02,726 --> 00:13:04,886
Didn't you use to be that actress?

153
00:13:07,663 --> 00:13:09,562
Yes.

154
00:13:11,067 --> 00:13:14,502
- Wow.
- Now, is that a nice room?

155
00:13:16,172 --> 00:13:21,040
Because though I am leaving soon,
I still would prefer a nice room.

156
00:13:23,245 --> 00:13:25,235
Your nicest...

157
00:13:26,482 --> 00:13:28,382
...if that is possible.

158
00:13:34,223 --> 00:13:36,349
Eight's very cozy.

159
00:13:45,401 --> 00:13:47,891
I tried to tell you.

160
00:13:50,206 --> 00:13:53,937
Hey! Hey, stop!
There's no way through.

161
00:13:54,111 --> 00:13:56,806
There's no way through!
No way through!

162
00:13:56,979 --> 00:13:58,411
- Lou, wake up.
- What?

163
00:13:59,081 --> 00:14:00,604
Cell phone.

164
00:14:00,783 --> 00:14:02,807
- What?
- Do you have a cell phone?

165
00:14:02,985 --> 00:14:04,383
Who wants to know?

166
00:14:05,054 --> 00:14:07,749
There's been an accident,
a bad one. A lady's hurt.

167
00:14:07,923 --> 00:14:10,823
- We need a cell phone right now.
- Dude, slow down.

168
00:14:10,993 --> 00:14:14,450
First, we don't know who you are.
Second, we don't see an accident...

169
00:14:14,630 --> 00:14:18,326
Listen to me, dude, I'm having a really
fucked-up, wet, bad fucking day.

170
00:14:18,501 --> 00:14:20,969
So if you have a cell phone,
give it to me now!

171
00:14:21,137 --> 00:14:26,574
Dude, we don't have a cell phone,
so could you just let go of me now?!

172
00:14:28,144 --> 00:14:30,907
I need you to give me a lift
in the other direction.

173
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:34,674
It's flooded that way too.
It's worse than this.

174
00:14:36,619 --> 00:14:38,483
Ginny, pop the trunk.
Let them in.

175
00:14:40,189 --> 00:14:41,746
Let them in.

176
00:14:58,974 --> 00:15:00,873
Hey. How you doing?

177
00:15:07,616 --> 00:15:10,345
- Phone still dead?
- Yeah. Where's your Lincoln?

178
00:15:10,519 --> 00:15:14,114
Stuck in a run-off two miles down
the road. The other way's fucked too.

179
00:15:14,290 --> 00:15:16,280
The kids gave us a lift.
The girl was stranded.

180
00:15:16,792 --> 00:15:19,259
- Is there another way out?
- Is she a hooker?

181
00:15:19,428 --> 00:15:21,054
Hey! Is there a back road?

182
00:15:21,230 --> 00:15:23,754
Where do you think the water's going?
You wouldn't get 500 feet.

183
00:15:23,933 --> 00:15:27,561
- How's the woman?
- I don't know. They're in number 4.

184
00:15:42,918 --> 00:15:45,818
I'm sorry. We don't rent rooms
by the hour.

185
00:15:47,723 --> 00:15:50,987
Funny. You still serving food?

186
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:55,220
Vending machines are around
the corner. Go ahead.

187
00:15:55,397 --> 00:15:59,833
Rooms are 30 bucks in advance with
picture ID. You need one room or two?

188
00:16:00,002 --> 00:16:03,597
Excuse me. I was talking to you.
I'd appreciate it if you looked at me.

189
00:16:04,373 --> 00:16:06,863
Well, I don't like looking at trash.

190
00:16:14,183 --> 00:16:18,744
We're a little stuck here, George.
I don't think we can get out tonight.

191
00:16:18,921 --> 00:16:23,653
- She just keeps shaking.
- She's in shock.

192
00:16:23,826 --> 00:16:26,225
- Let me take a look.
- What?

193
00:16:26,395 --> 00:16:28,955
Let me take a look.

194
00:16:45,948 --> 00:16:47,881
Did your wife pack a sewing kit?

195
00:16:48,584 --> 00:16:49,845
No.

196
00:16:55,023 --> 00:16:56,489
Ginny, wait up.

197
00:16:59,962 --> 00:17:02,122
Six.

198
00:17:02,664 --> 00:17:05,393
At least we got a good number.

199
00:17:51,413 --> 00:17:55,041
- Did you feel that?
- Feel what?

200
00:17:55,217 --> 00:17:56,877
Cold.

201
00:18:10,531 --> 00:18:12,362
Are you the manager?

202
00:18:12,534 --> 00:18:14,524
Yeah.

203
00:18:15,036 --> 00:18:19,802
I'm Officer Rhodes, Corrections.
I'm transporting a prisoner here.

204
00:18:19,975 --> 00:18:22,875
The law gives you the right
to refuse us service...

205
00:18:23,044 --> 00:18:25,477
...but the roads are flooded.
I could use a room.

206
00:18:25,647 --> 00:18:29,082
- It's an emergency.
- You got a radio in that car?

207
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:31,376
- Who's this?
- Limo driver, had an accident.

208
00:18:31,553 --> 00:18:34,715
I got a lady pretty banged up.
I could use an ambulance.

209
00:18:34,889 --> 00:18:37,755
Four-four-two requesting medical.

210
00:18:37,925 --> 00:18:40,621
Four-four-two requesting medical.

211
00:18:40,795 --> 00:18:43,524
Nothing. It's been like this
for the past hour.

212
00:18:43,698 --> 00:18:46,131
She's losing a lot of blood.
Got a first aid kit?

213
00:18:46,301 --> 00:18:47,665
Band-Aids, that's it.

214
00:18:47,836 --> 00:18:50,429
- How about a needle and thread?
- Maybe in the diner.

215
00:18:50,605 --> 00:18:55,132
I'll get it. Locked up.
Stay dry.

216
00:18:55,377 --> 00:18:57,936
I'll be back with your key.
I'll put you in 10.

217
00:18:58,113 --> 00:19:01,377
- Okay, thanks.
- What do you got back there?

218
00:19:01,548 --> 00:19:03,674
Prison transfer.

219
00:19:03,851 --> 00:19:07,184
Maybe when you get him situated,
come to 4 and look at the lady.

220
00:19:07,355 --> 00:19:10,585
- I could use a second opinion.
- Yeah, sure.

221
00:19:18,533 --> 00:19:21,296
Looks like you're fucked.

222
00:19:22,170 --> 00:19:23,431
Shut up!

223
00:19:37,385 --> 00:19:40,080
- I wish I had beige.
- This is fine.

224
00:19:40,255 --> 00:19:42,620
Would have been better.

225
00:19:42,791 --> 00:19:45,588
I gotta get the officer situated.
Let me know if you need something.

226
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:47,750
I'll be right back.

227
00:19:54,001 --> 00:19:56,765
Where did you learn to do that?

228
00:19:57,205 --> 00:19:59,968
Pretty much where you're standing.

229
00:20:13,288 --> 00:20:15,687
Hey, is the?

230
00:20:16,424 --> 00:20:19,358
The little boy, is he all right?

231
00:20:19,526 --> 00:20:21,959
He hasn't said a word
since the accident.

232
00:20:22,130 --> 00:20:26,691
No, no, no. He doesn't talk much
ever since the...

233
00:20:29,137 --> 00:20:31,570
I'm his stepfather.

234
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:33,866
His father...

235
00:20:35,176 --> 00:20:37,666
Two years ago, he left.

236
00:20:39,314 --> 00:20:41,679
Little temper problem.

237
00:20:57,665 --> 00:20:59,689
Watch your step.

238
00:21:06,808 --> 00:21:08,206
The furniture's for shit.

239
00:21:08,375 --> 00:21:12,708
If you're fixing to cuff him to
something, the toilet's bolted down.

240
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:14,780
Thank you so much
for your assistance.

241
00:21:14,949 --> 00:21:17,712
- It's a good idea. Come on.
- I got stripes

242
00:21:17,886 --> 00:21:22,288
Stripes around my shoulders
And these chains

243
00:21:22,457 --> 00:21:24,754
These chains
They're about to...

244
00:21:28,863 --> 00:21:30,625
Let's go look at that lady.

245
00:21:34,935 --> 00:21:37,368
- You get anyone?
- What?

246
00:21:37,805 --> 00:21:41,070
- Did you get through?
- No, not yet.

247
00:21:47,315 --> 00:21:49,009
Good stitch job.

248
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:54,783
Pulse is shallow, but steady.
Keep her comfortable.

249
00:21:54,956 --> 00:21:57,446
We should take turns on the radio,
if that's all right.

250
00:21:58,059 --> 00:22:00,788
No, it's not. I can manage.

251
00:22:16,878 --> 00:22:19,971
You gonna arrest me, officer?

252
00:22:23,518 --> 00:22:25,485
What?

253
00:22:26,486 --> 00:22:29,921
How'd you do that?
How'd you know I was a cop?

254
00:22:33,428 --> 00:22:35,793
No shit.

255
00:22:38,433 --> 00:22:41,026
Cheetos for dinner, huh?

256
00:22:41,202 --> 00:22:44,762
- That don't seem right.
- You got a better idea?

257
00:22:44,939 --> 00:22:49,170
I worked mess in the service.
Maybe the diner's open. I could...

258
00:22:49,344 --> 00:22:52,335
You got change for a dollar?

259
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:55,871
I don't know. Let me see.

260
00:23:05,126 --> 00:23:07,616
Here you go.

261
00:23:09,230 --> 00:23:10,992
You got a name?

262
00:23:12,333 --> 00:23:15,130
- Paris.
- Paris, huh?

263
00:23:15,303 --> 00:23:16,599
I'll get it.

264
00:23:16,770 --> 00:23:18,964
Never been.

265
00:23:19,139 --> 00:23:22,301
Well, you ain't going tonight.

266
00:23:32,787 --> 00:23:34,686
Please.

267
00:23:34,856 --> 00:23:37,585
Please be strong.

268
00:23:38,226 --> 00:23:42,025
You see, Timothy and I...

269
00:23:42,195 --> 00:23:44,560
...we need you.

270
00:23:45,165 --> 00:23:47,826
We need you so much.

271
00:24:46,728 --> 00:24:48,490
Lou?

272
00:24:51,032 --> 00:24:53,056
Lou?

273
00:25:24,431 --> 00:25:27,194
You need to tell them, Harry,
that I can't work, I can't perform...

274
00:25:27,367 --> 00:25:30,233
...I can't shine living
in an environment like that.

275
00:25:30,404 --> 00:25:34,841
No, it is not about the money.
It's about the working conditions.

276
00:26:06,507 --> 00:26:08,406
One bar.

277
00:26:09,010 --> 00:26:10,943
One bar.

278
00:26:11,145 --> 00:26:12,304
No bar.

279
00:26:13,281 --> 00:26:14,838
One bar.

280
00:26:15,015 --> 00:26:16,174
Two bars.

281
00:26:18,085 --> 00:26:20,450
Come on. Come on.

282
00:26:21,088 --> 00:26:22,850
Here we go.

283
00:26:25,226 --> 00:26:28,058
There you go. Come on.

284
00:26:31,933 --> 00:26:34,492
Goddamn desert wasteland!

285
00:26:42,409 --> 00:26:46,401
Oh, shit! I just had it.

286
00:30:28,169 --> 00:30:30,932
Holy fuck.

287
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:04,330
- Jesus, Mother of God.
- Who is this?

288
00:31:04,504 --> 00:31:07,768
The woman I was driving.

289
00:31:10,678 --> 00:31:13,874
- What the hell are you doing?
- There's something in there.

290
00:31:14,048 --> 00:31:16,140
- Use this, man.
- Thanks.

291
00:31:16,317 --> 00:31:19,513
- Are you a cop?
- I was.

292
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:30,558
- She was in Room 10?
- I am.

293
00:31:32,265 --> 00:31:36,292
- Where's your guy?
- Cuffed to a toilet.

294
00:31:46,346 --> 00:31:48,506
Son of a bitch.

295
00:31:49,816 --> 00:31:52,215
That was a fucking drive.

296
00:31:56,423 --> 00:31:59,391
- Gentlemen.
- Your Honor.

297
00:32:05,766 --> 00:32:09,462
Ready, Sharon? Alrighty.

298
00:32:09,637 --> 00:32:13,072
In the matter of Rivers v. Nevada,
for the purposes of...

299
00:32:13,239 --> 00:32:18,835
Judge Taylor, sir, with due respect,
we should wait till my client arrives.

300
00:32:19,312 --> 00:32:23,270
- He has a right to be present.
- He has precious few rights.

301
00:32:23,450 --> 00:32:25,349
He's 24 hours from execution.

302
00:32:26,453 --> 00:32:29,445
But to demonstrate his
mental state, which is the purpose...

303
00:32:29,824 --> 00:32:31,688
His mental state?

304
00:32:32,259 --> 00:32:34,021
His mental state?

305
00:32:34,562 --> 00:32:38,554
Do you know what time it is?
You think I got time for bullshit?

306
00:32:38,731 --> 00:32:42,325
That the justices called me in the
middle of the night to review a case...

307
00:32:42,502 --> 00:32:46,938
...I already sat on, that I already
decided, may make you happy.

308
00:32:47,106 --> 00:32:49,164
But it pisses me off.

309
00:32:49,409 --> 00:32:53,310
When your boy gets here, do what you
want, but in the name of decency...

310
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:56,040
...state your goddamn case!

311
00:32:57,885 --> 00:33:00,011
Yes, sir.

312
00:33:00,187 --> 00:33:02,211
Somebody get me
a cup of coffee, black.

313
00:33:07,894 --> 00:33:12,023
All right, everybody! Listen up!

314
00:33:12,999 --> 00:33:14,625
There was an incident tonight.

315
00:33:14,801 --> 00:33:16,893
That's police talk for,
"Someone's head got lopped off."

316
00:33:17,070 --> 00:33:18,468
Larry!

317
00:33:19,839 --> 00:33:22,865
- Caroline Suzanne was murdered.
- What?

318
00:33:23,043 --> 00:33:26,773
- Who's Caroline Suzanne?
- The actress I was driving.

319
00:33:26,947 --> 00:33:30,177
And where exactly did that happen?

320
00:33:30,350 --> 00:33:33,580
We don't know, because
we can't find the body.

321
00:33:33,786 --> 00:33:35,218
Not all of it anyway.

322
00:33:35,388 --> 00:33:40,450
- What do you mean, you can't find it?
- Stay calm. Everything will be all right.

323
00:33:40,627 --> 00:33:44,562
Officer Rhodes is outside.
He was transporting a convict.

324
00:33:44,731 --> 00:33:47,291
- Who escaped.
- What are you...?

325
00:33:48,435 --> 00:33:50,299
- Hold on.
- Running free!

326
00:33:50,471 --> 00:33:52,904
Will you shut the fuck
up so he can talk?

327
00:33:53,072 --> 00:33:56,040
This is my place, ho!
I'll say what I please!

328
00:33:56,209 --> 00:33:57,835
- It's safe here.
- It is not safe here!

329
00:33:58,011 --> 00:33:59,910
- There's a cop here.
- Yeah, two cops.

330
00:34:00,079 --> 00:34:01,739
Wait. You're a cop?

331
00:34:01,981 --> 00:34:07,475
- I was. Shut up, Larry!
- It's not safe here! I'm not staying...

332
00:34:07,954 --> 00:34:10,581
It's all right. It's okay.

333
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:14,285
Nothing.

334
00:34:14,461 --> 00:34:17,691
- Is she okay?
- Ginny.

335
00:34:17,964 --> 00:34:22,127
Ginny, will you?
Stop it. Don't do this right now.

336
00:34:23,036 --> 00:34:25,868
- What are you doing?
- Put your arm around your girlfriend.

337
00:34:26,039 --> 00:34:30,099
- Actually, she's my wife.
- Everybody just stay here.

338
00:34:30,276 --> 00:34:33,335
- Stay in this room.
- Wait! I'm not staying here if he is.

339
00:34:33,613 --> 00:34:35,136
- Yes, you are.
- No, I'm not.

340
00:34:35,315 --> 00:34:38,842
- I'm not.
- All right. Larry?

341
00:34:39,019 --> 00:34:40,451
- Come with us.
- Why?

342
00:34:40,721 --> 00:34:43,621
- You know the place.
- Here's what I know. I'm not a cop.

343
00:34:43,790 --> 00:34:46,383
I don't take orders from
a professional slut!

344
00:34:46,726 --> 00:34:49,717
- Fuck you!
- Listen. Just stay here, please.

345
00:34:49,896 --> 00:34:51,556
Keep everybody calm.

346
00:35:00,106 --> 00:35:03,233
He's not gonna get too far.
Not in this!

347
00:35:05,012 --> 00:35:07,002
Rhodes!

348
00:35:07,314 --> 00:35:08,871
What are we chasing here?

349
00:35:11,751 --> 00:35:14,548
Multiple homicide.

350
00:35:14,954 --> 00:35:18,389
I'll go around this way.
Meet you in back.

351
00:35:31,639 --> 00:35:34,664
Is that where you live
full-time? Las Vegas?

352
00:35:35,775 --> 00:35:39,073
- Used to.
- What's that supposed to mean?

353
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:44,042
It means I don't live there anymore.

354
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:21,982
Maine!

355
00:36:23,524 --> 00:36:27,220
We'll go see if we can use this one.
We'll go in here.

356
00:36:27,393 --> 00:36:30,919
Since that wasn't a successful
attempt, we'll go in here.

357
00:36:31,197 --> 00:36:35,758
I'll be right out here. It's okay.
I'm gonna stand guard.

358
00:36:36,002 --> 00:36:40,836
Not a worry. I'll be right here.
I'm not going anywhere.

359
00:36:47,715 --> 00:36:51,946
See, his mother usually does this.

360
00:37:12,905 --> 00:37:17,774
Hey, Ginny. So how long
you two been married?

361
00:37:17,944 --> 00:37:21,845
About nine hours. It was
a spur-of-the-moment kind of thing.

362
00:37:22,482 --> 00:37:24,176
Viva Las Vegas, huh, Gin?

363
00:37:25,184 --> 00:37:27,811
- We need to leave!
- I was just talking to her.

364
00:37:27,987 --> 00:37:30,614
Something's happening!
I need to get out of here!

365
00:37:30,790 --> 00:37:36,022
- Ginny! Ginny!
- You don't own me, Lou!

366
00:37:36,195 --> 00:37:38,492
I own what's inside you!
Half, at least.

367
00:37:38,664 --> 00:37:41,599
You don't own any part
of me or my baby!

368
00:37:41,769 --> 00:37:43,565
Then why did I marry you?

369
00:37:44,170 --> 00:37:48,731
- Don't slam the goddamn door on me!
- Hey! Hey!

370
00:37:48,908 --> 00:37:51,398
You guys, just calm down!

371
00:37:57,683 --> 00:38:02,051
We are not leaving.
There is no place else to go.

372
00:38:02,221 --> 00:38:06,248
There's a flood outside,
Ginny. Stop it! Stop it!

373
00:38:06,426 --> 00:38:09,292
I'm not pregnant!

374
00:38:13,432 --> 00:38:15,797
What did you just say?

375
00:38:18,604 --> 00:38:20,935
I lied.

376
00:38:21,641 --> 00:38:24,336
I'm not pregnant.

377
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:30,642
What are you talking about?
I saw the test.

378
00:38:35,288 --> 00:38:37,346
Why would you do that to me?

379
00:38:38,191 --> 00:38:42,559
Because Alison saw you at
The Hawk with that fucking girl!

380
00:38:47,233 --> 00:38:50,895
- Ginny, what are we, like 15?
- Go away!

381
00:38:52,305 --> 00:38:54,636
Goddamn!

382
00:39:13,726 --> 00:39:16,990
- Open this goddamn door, Ginny!
- No!

383
00:39:17,163 --> 00:39:19,995
I haven't been to The Hawk
in over a fucking year.

384
00:39:20,166 --> 00:39:25,934
Alison is a stupid bitch-whore,
who likes fucking with your head.

385
00:39:26,105 --> 00:39:28,402
Open the damn door, Ginny.

386
00:39:28,641 --> 00:39:32,440
- Open the fucking door!
- Not until you calm down!

387
00:39:32,812 --> 00:39:36,679
I'm calm! I am very fucking calm!

388
00:39:46,359 --> 00:39:48,826
What are you doing?

389
00:39:51,898 --> 00:39:54,661
Lou?

390
00:40:08,948 --> 00:40:13,179
Ginny, open this damn door!
Open the door!

391
00:40:13,686 --> 00:40:16,484
- Open the door!
- Stop it, stop it!

392
00:40:17,623 --> 00:40:22,116
Ginny, damn it, open the door!
Ginny, Ginny, Ginny!

393
00:40:22,295 --> 00:40:24,728
Lou, please stop!

394
00:41:02,635 --> 00:41:05,034
Lou?

395
00:41:46,212 --> 00:41:50,614
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

396
00:41:50,783 --> 00:41:53,580
Help me! Somebody help me!

397
00:42:01,627 --> 00:42:03,992
Help me!

398
00:42:04,363 --> 00:42:07,820
Help me! Somebody help me!

399
00:42:08,234 --> 00:42:11,896
Is he in there? Is he in there?

400
00:42:13,506 --> 00:42:17,066
Ginny, are you okay?
What happened? What happened?

401
00:42:23,782 --> 00:42:26,808
- Oh, shit.
- Jesus Christ.

402
00:42:35,194 --> 00:42:38,253
Lou? Lou?

403
00:42:39,398 --> 00:42:41,490
What's going on?

404
00:44:04,215 --> 00:44:05,579
What the hell?

405
00:44:08,754 --> 00:44:10,618
Oh, shit!

406
00:44:12,858 --> 00:44:15,018
Come here!

407
00:44:29,674 --> 00:44:33,541
They caught him. They caught him.

408
00:44:41,687 --> 00:44:44,086
Why are we keeping him in here?

409
00:44:44,890 --> 00:44:48,052
- Where would you prefer, Larry?
- I don't know.

410
00:44:48,327 --> 00:44:50,954
I told you to stay in 3, didn't I?
Did I tell you that?

411
00:44:51,130 --> 00:44:55,896
They got in a fight! I tried to
get them to go back inside!

412
00:44:56,067 --> 00:44:58,830
Should we try the radio again?

413
00:44:59,137 --> 00:45:02,937
Larry, just stay here and watch him.

414
00:45:03,108 --> 00:45:06,634
- Go back and look after Ginny.
- Where are you going?

415
00:45:06,979 --> 00:45:09,640
Just do it, please.

416
00:45:10,549 --> 00:45:11,776
Ed?

417
00:45:15,554 --> 00:45:18,181
I don't know if I'm comfortable
with guard duty, per se.

418
00:45:18,857 --> 00:45:22,019
He's unconscious, Larry.
He's tied to a post.

419
00:45:45,050 --> 00:45:47,483
Timothy.

420
00:45:50,388 --> 00:45:52,447
Timothy.

421
00:45:58,897 --> 00:46:04,198
Alice? Oh, my God. Alice?

422
00:46:05,537 --> 00:46:07,902
I don't remember anything.

423
00:46:08,641 --> 00:46:11,200
We had an accident.

424
00:46:12,143 --> 00:46:14,667
George? Can you keep
an eye on Ginny for a minute?

425
00:46:14,979 --> 00:46:21,179
She's awake now. I have
to get some aspirin to help her.

426
00:46:22,521 --> 00:46:25,683
Darling, I gotta go get
something out of my room.

427
00:46:42,440 --> 00:46:45,238
- Shit!
- What's wrong, buddy?

428
00:46:45,911 --> 00:46:47,707
What do you got in the fridge?

429
00:46:48,614 --> 00:46:51,309
- You shut up.
- What's in there?

430
00:46:53,752 --> 00:46:56,379
What's in there?

431
00:46:56,555 --> 00:46:58,522
- What do you got in there?
- Shut up.

432
00:46:58,924 --> 00:47:00,754
What is it, huh?

433
00:47:00,926 --> 00:47:02,688
- Shut up.
- You can tell me.

434
00:47:02,994 --> 00:47:07,089
I'm good at keeping secrets.
I got a whopper myself.

435
00:47:26,485 --> 00:47:28,076
What are you doing?

436
00:47:28,519 --> 00:47:29,712
Motherfucker!

437
00:47:29,887 --> 00:47:33,720
- What are you doing out here?
- Getting shit that's mine.

438
00:47:33,891 --> 00:47:37,520
What are you doing?
What, I don't get to ask a question?

439
00:47:37,696 --> 00:47:41,096
I'm taking photos. There's been two
murders. Before all the evidence...

440
00:47:41,266 --> 00:47:45,395
That's not an answer. You're a limo
driver. What are you doing?

441
00:47:45,571 --> 00:47:49,506
Looking to win some "beyond the call
of duty," limo-driver merit badge?

442
00:47:49,675 --> 00:47:52,973
You're not on the job anymore.
You don't need to be a hero.

443
00:47:53,145 --> 00:47:55,510
There's a real, live,
active-duty cop outside...

444
00:47:55,680 --> 00:47:58,477
The one who's managed to lose
a convicted killer?

445
00:48:01,052 --> 00:48:02,815
You're a complicated cat, Edward.

446
00:48:03,956 --> 00:48:06,355
No. Not really.

447
00:48:06,759 --> 00:48:09,022
I think so.

448
00:48:11,263 --> 00:48:13,696
What month were you born?

449
00:48:14,233 --> 00:48:17,133
- May.
- Taurus.

450
00:48:18,203 --> 00:48:19,999
Same as me.

451
00:48:23,307 --> 00:48:26,969
- Where were you a cop?
- Los Angeles.

452
00:48:27,512 --> 00:48:30,675
Were you fired or did you quit?

453
00:48:31,083 --> 00:48:33,346
I took medical leave.

454
00:48:33,886 --> 00:48:36,649
It was making me sick.

455
00:48:37,856 --> 00:48:41,086
I burned out, I guess.
Wasn't up for it.

456
00:48:45,229 --> 00:48:47,423
One day I got a call...

457
00:48:49,801 --> 00:48:52,132
...for a jumper.

458
00:48:52,303 --> 00:48:54,271
A young Mexican girl.

459
00:48:56,809 --> 00:49:00,266
Pregnant, infected with AIDS,
totally strung-out.

460
00:49:00,879 --> 00:49:04,439
She was truly one of the doomed.

461
00:49:07,486 --> 00:49:11,387
I asked her to come in off
the ledge and into my arms.

462
00:49:11,956 --> 00:49:14,981
She asked me why
she should bother living.

463
00:49:21,400 --> 00:49:23,697
What did you say?

464
00:49:25,804 --> 00:49:28,567
I was trained
to tell her lots of things.

465
00:49:28,740 --> 00:49:32,038
Her dreams, all the people
who'd miss her.

466
00:49:32,911 --> 00:49:35,811
But for a second, I hesitated.

467
00:49:36,948 --> 00:49:39,006
And she saw it.

468
00:49:42,220 --> 00:49:47,715
Within that second, I couldn't think of
one optimistic thing to say to her.

469
00:49:51,497 --> 00:49:54,693
So she spread her arms
and jumped.

470
00:49:59,905 --> 00:50:02,202
I started getting headaches...

471
00:50:04,509 --> 00:50:07,671
...and eventually started blacking out.

472
00:50:08,913 --> 00:50:13,282
So I filed for medical.

473
00:50:29,133 --> 00:50:31,259
What?

474
00:50:33,571 --> 00:50:35,333
What is it?

475
00:50:39,678 --> 00:50:41,474
Rhodes!

476
00:50:41,647 --> 00:50:46,743
- It's worse. Nothing but static!
- Where's that key from the actress?

477
00:50:48,220 --> 00:50:50,517
This was on the kid.

478
00:50:52,189 --> 00:50:54,952
- What is it, some kind of countdown?
- Larry!

479
00:50:57,495 --> 00:51:01,089
What the fuck is he doing?
Larry, come over here!

480
00:51:01,732 --> 00:51:05,532
Come over here, man.
What are you doing? Come over here.

481
00:51:06,939 --> 00:51:10,032
- What are you doing?
- I just went to get something.

482
00:51:10,976 --> 00:51:14,672
We told you to watch the guy.
What are you doing in your office?

483
00:51:15,480 --> 00:51:16,946
I just went to get something.

484
00:51:17,115 --> 00:51:20,845
How many sets of keys are there
to this place? Look at me. How many?

485
00:51:21,018 --> 00:51:23,451
- Two and a master set.
- Oh, my fucking God!

486
00:51:24,288 --> 00:51:30,693
Larry, you mother...! You son of a...!
Get the fuck in here! Get in here!

487
00:51:32,731 --> 00:51:35,324
Why did you kill him?
Why did you kill my con?

488
00:51:35,500 --> 00:51:40,402
Holy shit! Who did that?
Jesus Christ, I didn't do that!

489
00:51:40,572 --> 00:51:42,163
Bullshit! You're lying!

490
00:51:42,341 --> 00:51:46,242
- It's your bat sticking out of his throat!
- I know, but I didn't do it!

491
00:51:46,410 --> 00:51:48,138
Check the doors!

492
00:51:48,312 --> 00:51:49,938
- I didn't do it!
- Look at him!

493
00:51:50,114 --> 00:51:53,344
- Why'd you kill him?
- Why were you outside?

494
00:51:53,517 --> 00:51:55,542
- Why'd you leave him?
- I was scared.

495
00:51:55,721 --> 00:51:57,950
- What were you scared of?
- You wouldn't understand.

496
00:51:58,123 --> 00:51:59,589
Try me.

497
00:51:59,758 --> 00:52:01,520
- Why'd you kill my con?
- I didn't!

498
00:52:01,693 --> 00:52:05,594
I don't know how...
I went to my office, that's all!

499
00:52:05,764 --> 00:52:08,425
- Why'd you leave him?
- This your key? Number 8?

500
00:52:08,599 --> 00:52:11,226
Ten, nine, eight, huh?
This is your key!

501
00:52:11,402 --> 00:52:13,369
You can't say that!
Those aren't my keys!

502
00:52:13,537 --> 00:52:16,505
That's like leading the witness
or something. Look.

503
00:52:16,674 --> 00:52:20,370
These are my keys, okay?
These are my keys. You see?

504
00:52:21,913 --> 00:52:24,278
You got a Gucci wallet?
It's the actress's.

505
00:52:24,449 --> 00:52:28,851
Yes, I took her wallet.
Afterwards. After she died!

506
00:52:29,021 --> 00:52:34,424
Afterwards, all right? I didn't kill her.
And I didn't kill him.

507
00:52:34,592 --> 00:52:39,358
- Let her go, Larry.
- Get back! You won't pin this on me.

508
00:52:39,530 --> 00:52:41,554
- Timothy?
- Get him out of here!

509
00:52:41,732 --> 00:52:45,098
- Put it down.
- I didn't hurt anybody. No one!

510
00:52:45,269 --> 00:52:48,636
But I don't like cheap fucking whores!
If you take one more step...

511
00:52:48,807 --> 00:52:51,138
Fuck!

512
00:52:59,316 --> 00:53:01,283
Get it off!

513
00:53:05,122 --> 00:53:06,247
Shit!

514
00:53:14,232 --> 00:53:16,995
Come on, you little bitch.
Please fucking start.

515
00:53:17,569 --> 00:53:20,298
- Goddamn it!
- Hey!

516
00:53:21,239 --> 00:53:23,502
Larry, stop!

517
00:53:26,744 --> 00:53:28,108
What is going on?

518
00:53:28,679 --> 00:53:30,976
- Larry!
- Get out of my way, I didn't do shit!

519
00:53:34,351 --> 00:53:36,978
Timothy! Timothy!

520
00:53:59,510 --> 00:54:01,875
An insanity plea was
refused by the court...

521
00:54:02,046 --> 00:54:06,540
...despite the fact that my client
is a certifiable Axis IV dissociative.

522
00:54:06,718 --> 00:54:11,381
To this day, he remains unaware of
the crimes for which he was convicted.

523
00:54:11,556 --> 00:54:17,357
In 1986, the Supreme Court ruled
decisively that states cannot execute...

524
00:54:17,495 --> 00:54:20,759
...a person who does not understand
why he's being put to death.

525
00:54:20,931 --> 00:54:22,227
He signed a confession.

526
00:54:22,399 --> 00:54:25,925
- He didn't just sign it, he dictated it.
- Thirdly...

527
00:54:26,103 --> 00:54:31,598
...Malcolm's diaries found
misfiled in state evidence.

528
00:54:31,777 --> 00:54:36,736
Your Honor, this notebook contains
entries made just before the murders.

529
00:54:36,915 --> 00:54:41,248
Important to note are the spectacular
changes in handwriting style...

530
00:54:41,418 --> 00:54:43,180
...tone, point of view.

531
00:54:43,354 --> 00:54:48,188
What you are looking at are the private
thoughts of several different people.

532
00:54:48,359 --> 00:54:52,124
With permission,
Dr. Mallick will elaborate.

533
00:54:52,296 --> 00:54:54,763
Thank you.

534
00:54:55,065 --> 00:54:58,796
Your Honor, there is no
universally efficacious treatment...

535
00:54:58,970 --> 00:55:01,802
...for Dissociative Identity Disorder.

536
00:55:01,973 --> 00:55:06,238
In theory, one attempts to move
the patient towards integration.

537
00:55:06,411 --> 00:55:11,006
- A folding of their fractured psyche.
- Your Honor?

538
00:55:11,448 --> 00:55:12,880
He's here.

539
00:55:30,268 --> 00:55:32,963
No! What you saw was an accident!

540
00:55:33,137 --> 00:55:35,297
He ran out in front of me!
I'm not a murderer!

541
00:55:35,472 --> 00:55:37,530
There's a dead body
in your freezer, Larry.

542
00:55:37,708 --> 00:55:40,232
- I didn't kill him. I found him like that.
- Stop it!

543
00:55:40,411 --> 00:55:43,902
Listen! Listen! I was in Vegas last
month and I lost everything, okay?

544
00:55:44,081 --> 00:55:45,308
Everything!

545
00:55:45,482 --> 00:55:49,111
I drove west. I didn't know where
to go, but I was running on empty...

546
00:55:49,287 --> 00:55:51,720
...so I pulled in here at this place.

547
00:55:51,890 --> 00:55:56,223
And there was no one at the station,
so I came over to the office...

548
00:55:56,394 --> 00:55:58,190
...and I walked in.

549
00:55:58,362 --> 00:56:01,228
And there, sitting at that desk
right there, was the manager...

550
00:56:01,398 --> 00:56:04,059
...facedown in a Banquet Potpie.
Dead!

551
00:56:04,235 --> 00:56:07,533
- Heart attack or something.
- Banquet Potpie!

552
00:56:07,705 --> 00:56:10,264
He'd been sitting there
for God knows how long.

553
00:56:10,441 --> 00:56:14,468
All of a sudden, this auto-parts
salesman pulls up, looking for a room.

554
00:56:14,646 --> 00:56:16,909
I didn't have a fucking dime...

555
00:56:17,082 --> 00:56:19,675
...so I took his 30 and gave him one.

556
00:56:19,851 --> 00:56:24,150
I just took the key from the wall
and gave him a room.

557
00:56:24,321 --> 00:56:28,620
Maybe that was wrong,
but I was broke, and that's what I did.

558
00:56:29,660 --> 00:56:31,684
Then I came back in here...

559
00:56:32,263 --> 00:56:35,857
...and I moved Larry's body...
His name was Larry too.

560
00:56:36,033 --> 00:56:39,661
I put him in the freezer.

561
00:56:42,274 --> 00:56:45,003
I wasn't trying to hide him.
It was hot out.

562
00:56:45,176 --> 00:56:49,771
I thought it was the best place for him
till his family or someone came along.

563
00:56:49,947 --> 00:56:52,471
Only no one did...

564
00:56:52,950 --> 00:56:55,679
...except more guests.

565
00:56:55,886 --> 00:56:58,752
So I checked them in too.

566
00:56:59,657 --> 00:57:02,147
And they all seemed happy...

567
00:57:02,326 --> 00:57:04,987
...so I just stayed.

568
00:57:06,030 --> 00:57:09,193
Cry me a river.
This is a total crock of shit!

569
00:57:09,367 --> 00:57:11,800
- No, it's not!
- Admit it, you killed him!

570
00:57:11,970 --> 00:57:14,733
Just like you killed my con.
Just like you killed her husband.

571
00:57:14,905 --> 00:57:17,532
Just like you killed his actress.
Just admit it.

572
00:57:17,708 --> 00:57:21,404
- Say it, "I killed them."
- Stop it! He can't take any more!

573
00:57:21,578 --> 00:57:25,138
Everything is okay now. Everything
is fine. We got the guy. It's fine.

574
00:57:25,316 --> 00:57:27,044
- I don't know what we got.
- What?

575
00:57:27,217 --> 00:57:29,684
We thought we got the guy
two hours ago, then...

576
00:57:29,853 --> 00:57:32,219
You believe this shit?
It's him! It's this guy!

577
00:57:32,390 --> 00:57:34,516
He had a knife to your neck,
remember?

578
00:57:35,694 --> 00:57:38,856
His story's so unbelievable,
I think it just might be true.

579
00:57:39,663 --> 00:57:41,061
She's got a point.

580
00:57:44,101 --> 00:57:46,261
You guys are crazy.

581
00:57:46,470 --> 00:57:48,699
Maybe it's the burial ground.

582
00:57:50,574 --> 00:57:51,767
What?

583
00:57:53,444 --> 00:57:57,607
Read the brochure in there.
It's all around us.

584
00:57:57,781 --> 00:58:00,875
A hundred years ago, the government
moved these Indians here.

585
00:58:01,052 --> 00:58:04,282
They all died
because there was no water.

586
00:58:06,357 --> 00:58:08,756
Now they're coming back to life
like sea monkeys, huh?

587
00:58:08,926 --> 00:58:10,893
Come on.
Give me a break, sweetheart.

588
00:58:11,061 --> 00:58:13,392
- Just take it easy, Rhodes.
- You know, you take it easy!

589
00:58:13,564 --> 00:58:17,260
You've tried to run this show all night.
Giving orders, pointing fingers!

590
00:58:17,434 --> 00:58:20,425
You blamed my con for everything,
and he ends up dead.

591
00:58:20,604 --> 00:58:23,629
I'm telling you, it's him!
We all saw him run down George.

592
00:58:23,807 --> 00:58:27,265
Your actress's wallet is right there.
She's dead, there's the wallet.

593
00:58:27,445 --> 00:58:30,311
- What more do you want?
- Stop it! Please shut up!

594
00:58:31,382 --> 00:58:34,509
All right. You want a plan?
Here's the plan, okay?

595
00:58:34,685 --> 00:58:38,916
No one's gonna move. We'll stay
here, like this, in this room until dawn.

596
00:58:39,089 --> 00:58:41,249
No one leaves, no one moves.

597
00:58:41,425 --> 00:58:44,393
And if he tries anything,
I'm gonna shoot him!

598
00:58:44,561 --> 00:58:47,757
And if something out there
comes in here, I'll shoot it!

599
00:58:47,931 --> 00:58:50,832
And if anyone of us tries anything,
I'll shoot them!

600
00:58:51,002 --> 00:58:52,468
- We get it.
- Good!

601
00:59:26,303 --> 00:59:28,770
Timmy? Timmy?

602
00:59:28,939 --> 00:59:32,135
- You need to stay in here with us.
- It's all right.

603
00:59:38,849 --> 00:59:42,148
Remember that movie where
the 10 strangers went to an island...

604
00:59:42,320 --> 00:59:44,719
...and then they all died
one by one...

605
00:59:44,889 --> 00:59:49,257
...and then it turned out they weren't
strangers, they all had a connection?

606
00:59:49,426 --> 00:59:51,655
They all messed with the wrong guy,
and he was getting revenge.

607
00:59:51,829 --> 00:59:53,227
Shut up!

608
00:59:54,965 --> 00:59:58,024
I'm just saying maybe there's
a connection between all of us.

609
00:59:58,469 --> 00:59:59,799
Like what?

610
01:00:00,370 --> 01:00:03,395
- We're all in Nevada.
- Shut up!

611
01:00:06,076 --> 01:00:09,273
Where were you going with your con
when you pulled in here?

612
01:00:11,049 --> 01:00:14,484
Carson City. Okay?

613
01:00:15,986 --> 01:00:20,046
I was going home to Florida.
Where were you going?

614
01:00:20,224 --> 01:00:22,088
I was taking the actress to L.A.

615
01:00:22,459 --> 01:00:23,982
I was born in Florida.

616
01:00:25,095 --> 01:00:27,824
Since you been in that chair,
no one's died, so shut up!

617
01:00:27,998 --> 01:00:29,430
No one's died since we've
all been here!

618
01:00:29,600 --> 01:00:32,591
- Hey, sweetie, sit down.
- Where in Florida, Larry?

619
01:00:34,772 --> 01:00:38,172
- Where in Florida?
- Friends now, huh? Great.

620
01:00:39,443 --> 01:00:42,775
- Polk County.
- That's where I was born.

621
01:00:42,946 --> 01:00:45,277
- Which town?
- Mulberry.

622
01:00:45,449 --> 01:00:48,713
- Frostproof.
- No wonder you left.

623
01:00:49,052 --> 01:00:51,144
There's a town called Frostproof?

624
01:00:51,522 --> 01:00:55,457
They grow oranges.
The name doubles as a slogan.

625
01:00:55,626 --> 01:00:59,391
I danced hallelujah the day I left Polk.
Why would you wanna go back?

626
01:00:59,564 --> 01:01:02,532
I found a grove for sale
on the Internet.

627
01:01:02,700 --> 01:01:06,032
Nine acres, 1200 trees.
Limes and oranges.

628
01:01:06,803 --> 01:01:10,363
According to the realtor, the soil
needs a few tills, phosphorous...

629
01:01:10,541 --> 01:01:16,945
...lanes need reading,
but it's real good land.

630
01:01:20,984 --> 01:01:22,814
What?

631
01:01:23,453 --> 01:01:25,477
It sounds nice.

632
01:01:46,076 --> 01:01:47,269
Ed?

633
01:01:50,781 --> 01:01:53,011
She's dead.

634
01:02:12,569 --> 01:02:15,036
Get him out of here.

635
01:02:15,872 --> 01:02:18,841
Come on.
Come on, sweetie.

636
01:02:25,616 --> 01:02:28,015
Look at this.

637
01:02:33,457 --> 01:02:36,892
- Where'd you get that?
- Right here.

638
01:02:41,131 --> 01:02:45,397
This doesn't make any sense.
She died from an accident.

639
01:02:45,569 --> 01:02:50,028
George was an accident,
if you believe Larry.

640
01:02:53,010 --> 01:02:55,409
Where is seven?

641
01:02:58,115 --> 01:03:00,105
Back it up!

642
01:03:36,321 --> 01:03:41,019
- See, I told you it wasn't me!
- That's not possible.

643
01:03:41,191 --> 01:03:45,286
I was standing right there. I saw what
happened. We all saw what happened.

644
01:03:45,462 --> 01:03:48,988
He ran out. Nobody could have
known he was gonna do that.

645
01:03:49,166 --> 01:03:50,462
No one human.

646
01:03:50,634 --> 01:03:53,101
We're back to that again?
It's the spirits, huh?

647
01:03:53,270 --> 01:03:57,330
Maybe it's the ghost of the guy
that Larry put in the freezer.

648
01:03:59,276 --> 01:04:01,210
Somebody untie me.
Goddamn it!

649
01:04:01,379 --> 01:04:03,073
You know it wasn't me.
Come on.

650
01:04:03,246 --> 01:04:03,379
- Listen.
- We gotta get out...

651
01:04:03,380 --> 01:04:05,176
- Listen.
- We gotta get out...

652
01:04:05,349 --> 01:04:07,578
Take her car and get out.
You, her and the kid.

653
01:04:07,751 --> 01:04:08,978
There's nowhere to go.

654
01:04:09,152 --> 01:04:11,176
- How much gas do you have?
- Half a tank.

655
01:04:11,355 --> 01:04:13,447
You can drive till dawn on that.
Look at me.

656
01:04:13,623 --> 01:04:16,284
When you get to where it's flooded,
go the other way.

657
01:04:16,460 --> 01:04:17,824
I don't know if I can.

658
01:04:17,994 --> 01:04:21,121
Get the kid and go.
Right now. Come on.

659
01:04:21,298 --> 01:04:22,286
Timmy.

660
01:04:22,466 --> 01:04:25,093
Timmy, come on. Let's go.
Get up.

661
01:04:25,268 --> 01:04:26,427
What's going on?

662
01:04:26,603 --> 01:04:28,332
- They can't leave!
- This way.

663
01:04:28,505 --> 01:04:30,472
We'll see you
when the storm breaks.

664
01:04:30,640 --> 01:04:33,972
Hey! Hey! They can't leave!
Where are they going? Get back here!

665
01:04:34,144 --> 01:04:35,735
Go, go, go!
They're leaving.

666
01:04:35,912 --> 01:04:37,276
- They're not leaving.
- Go!

667
01:04:37,447 --> 01:04:40,176
You can't let suspects leave
after four people have been killed!

668
01:04:40,350 --> 01:04:43,284
- You really think they're suspects?
- They're not leaving!

669
01:04:50,026 --> 01:04:51,549
Shit.

670
01:04:52,062 --> 01:04:53,927
Ginny!

671
01:04:55,899 --> 01:04:58,662
Extinguishers.
Larry, you got a fire extinguisher?

672
01:04:59,136 --> 01:05:01,501
- Fire extinguisher! Where?
- Back there!

673
01:05:24,661 --> 01:05:26,560
Nobody in there.

674
01:05:31,935 --> 01:05:34,926
Maybe it got so hot,
they got cremated.

675
01:05:35,105 --> 01:05:37,163
There'd be something left.

676
01:05:41,445 --> 01:05:42,809
You did this.

677
01:05:43,447 --> 01:05:46,610
You did this!
You told them to get into the car!

678
01:05:46,783 --> 01:05:48,249
Are you happy?

679
01:06:12,375 --> 01:06:14,535
Where is he?

680
01:07:14,971 --> 01:07:16,164
Nothing.

681
01:07:22,312 --> 01:07:24,643
I give up!

682
01:07:25,715 --> 01:07:28,342
I give up!
What the hell do you want?

683
01:07:28,517 --> 01:07:32,851
What do you want, you sick bastard?
What the fuck do you want from us?

684
01:07:34,457 --> 01:07:38,222
I am turning 30 next week
and I just want to go home...

685
01:07:38,395 --> 01:07:40,123
...and grow oranges!

686
01:07:47,003 --> 01:07:49,732
It's your birthday next week?

687
01:07:49,906 --> 01:07:52,806
It's my birthday next week.
The 10th.

688
01:07:54,376 --> 01:07:55,673
Me too.

689
01:07:59,849 --> 01:08:01,281
Me too.

690
01:08:04,087 --> 01:08:05,849
Yeah.

691
01:08:08,158 --> 01:08:10,682
George York, May 10.

692
01:08:10,860 --> 01:08:12,793
Alice York, May 10.

693
01:08:12,963 --> 01:08:14,793
Caroline Suzanne, May 10.

694
01:08:15,832 --> 01:08:18,391
Ginny and Lou Isiana, May 10.

695
01:08:18,567 --> 01:08:20,967
Me, Larry Washington,
May fucking 10.

696
01:08:22,038 --> 01:08:24,835
What are the odds?
Must be 10 trillion-to-one.

697
01:08:27,510 --> 01:08:28,703
What is it?

698
01:08:43,993 --> 01:08:46,587
- Where's the fuse box, Larry?
- Other side of the building.

699
01:08:53,737 --> 01:08:55,761
Ginny and Lou Isiana.

700
01:08:56,373 --> 01:08:59,170
Virginia and Louisiana.

701
01:08:59,342 --> 01:09:01,536
Caroline, Carolina.

702
01:09:03,413 --> 01:09:05,403
Paris Nevada.

703
01:09:05,582 --> 01:09:07,208
George York.

704
01:09:08,183 --> 01:09:10,616
Larry Washington.

705
01:09:12,822 --> 01:09:15,756
Rhodes, Rhode Island.

706
01:09:21,331 --> 01:09:23,890
Ed Dakota.

707
01:09:38,013 --> 01:09:42,473
When I was going up the stairs
I met a man who wasn't there

708
01:09:42,652 --> 01:09:45,017
He wasn't there again today

709
01:09:45,188 --> 01:09:47,052
I wish
I wish he'd go away

710
01:09:48,825 --> 01:09:50,883
Who is this?

711
01:09:51,061 --> 01:09:54,029
Who am I speaking to right now?

712
01:09:56,766 --> 01:09:58,995
Where did you learn that poem?

713
01:09:59,168 --> 01:10:01,567
Who am I speaking to?
Look at me.

714
01:10:01,737 --> 01:10:04,000
Who am I speaking to right now?

715
01:10:10,613 --> 01:10:11,840
Doc?

716
01:10:15,051 --> 01:10:17,314
- Edward?
- What's happening?

717
01:10:17,654 --> 01:10:20,315
- Please be quiet.
- He can hear what we're saying?

718
01:10:20,623 --> 01:10:23,022
Of course I can hear
what you're fucking saying.

719
01:10:23,193 --> 01:10:28,255
Edward, you missed your last
appointment. Where have you been?

720
01:10:30,433 --> 01:10:33,731
- Did I black out again?
- Try and think back.

721
01:10:33,903 --> 01:10:36,370
Where have you been?

722
01:10:36,539 --> 01:10:39,200
All right.
I was driving this actress...

723
01:10:39,709 --> 01:10:44,839
...and we got stuck at the motel.
There was a storm.

724
01:10:45,782 --> 01:10:48,443
We couldn't get out
because of the storm.

725
01:10:48,618 --> 01:10:50,778
What happened at the motel?

726
01:10:53,622 --> 01:10:56,352
People started dying.

727
01:10:56,526 --> 01:10:59,551
And then their bodies...
It didn't make any sense.

728
01:10:59,729 --> 01:11:01,457
They disappeared.

729
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:06,661
Edward, I'd like to show
something to you, if I may.

730
01:11:11,975 --> 01:11:14,408
Do you recognize this man?

731
01:11:16,311 --> 01:11:17,743
No.

732
01:11:18,380 --> 01:11:21,212
That man, Edward,
is Malcolm Rivers.

733
01:11:21,383 --> 01:11:24,978
He's had a very troubled life.
He was arrested four years ago...

734
01:11:25,155 --> 01:11:28,521
...and convicted of the murder
of six people in a violent rampage.

735
01:11:28,992 --> 01:11:31,221
- He did this.
- Detective, please.

736
01:11:31,394 --> 01:11:33,020
Edward, listen to me.

737
01:11:33,429 --> 01:11:39,333
When faced with an intense trauma,
a child's mind may fracture...

738
01:11:39,502 --> 01:11:43,062
...creating disassociated identities.

739
01:11:43,872 --> 01:11:47,307
That's exactly what happened
to Malcolm Rivers.

740
01:11:47,476 --> 01:11:49,876
He developed a condition
that is commonly known...

741
01:11:50,046 --> 01:11:52,946
...as Multiple Personality Syndrome.

742
01:11:58,188 --> 01:12:00,121
Why are you telling me this?

743
01:12:01,391 --> 01:12:03,654
Because you, Edward...

744
01:12:03,827 --> 01:12:06,954
...are one of his personalities.

745
01:12:11,433 --> 01:12:13,059
What?

746
01:12:27,650 --> 01:12:30,914
Jesus Christ! What the fuck
did you do to my face?

747
01:12:31,087 --> 01:12:32,781
- Keep calm.
- Where is my face?

748
01:12:32,955 --> 01:12:35,445
- That is your face.
- Why am I tied up?

749
01:12:35,624 --> 01:12:37,215
- Keep calm.
- Where is...?

750
01:12:37,392 --> 01:12:38,915
- Please.
- Jesus Christ!

751
01:12:39,094 --> 01:12:41,255
- Where is my face?
- Stay calm.

752
01:12:41,431 --> 01:12:45,127
No! I'm not gonna stay calm!
Why am I tied up like this?

753
01:12:45,301 --> 01:12:48,758
Who are all these people?
What happened at the motel?

754
01:12:48,938 --> 01:12:51,963
- Where is everybody?
- They don't exist, Edward.

755
01:12:52,141 --> 01:12:54,734
You were all created
by Malcolm as a child.

756
01:12:54,911 --> 01:12:57,310
- You're a liar!
- Consider what you know.

757
01:12:57,479 --> 01:12:59,844
- Everyone named after a state.
- No.

758
01:13:00,015 --> 01:13:03,472
Everyone sharing the same birthday.
Your blackouts.

759
01:13:03,652 --> 01:13:05,118
No! I was a cop!

760
01:13:05,287 --> 01:13:09,018
I was a cop in the Rampart Division
of L.A.P.D. For six years.

761
01:13:09,192 --> 01:13:10,215
Edward, please.

762
01:13:10,393 --> 01:13:12,792
I live in Hollywood,
in a studio apartment.

763
01:13:12,962 --> 01:13:15,327
- You don't live there.
- I do live there!

764
01:13:15,598 --> 01:13:17,360
You don't live anywhere.

765
01:13:17,700 --> 01:13:21,760
I know this is difficult to accept,
but the face you saw in that mirror...

766
01:13:21,938 --> 01:13:27,239
...is the face I've always seen when
I talk to Edward or Paris or Larry...

767
01:13:27,409 --> 01:13:29,342
...or anyone else you've met tonight.

768
01:13:29,511 --> 01:13:33,447
Malcolm is in the midst
of a medical treatment.

769
01:13:33,616 --> 01:13:39,178
One which forces all his identities to
confront one another for the first time.

770
01:13:39,355 --> 01:13:41,879
I knew there would be violence...

771
01:13:42,058 --> 01:13:47,290
...and with it, the number
of the identities would be reduced.

772
01:13:49,631 --> 01:13:51,530
Reduced?

773
01:13:51,700 --> 01:13:54,497
One of the personalities
you've met tonight, Edward...

774
01:13:54,670 --> 01:13:57,571
...committed those murders
four years ago.

775
01:13:57,941 --> 01:14:01,706
He took control of Malcolm's body,
as you have now...

776
01:14:01,878 --> 01:14:07,076
...and released an unspeakable rage.
And in 19 hours...

777
01:14:07,250 --> 01:14:10,810
...Malcolm Rivers will be put to death
because of those actions...

778
01:14:10,987 --> 01:14:14,854
...unless I can convince that man...

779
01:14:15,023 --> 01:14:17,422
...that the killer is gone.

780
01:14:20,696 --> 01:14:23,129
I need you to stay with me.
Edward?

781
01:14:23,298 --> 01:14:26,597
I need your help.
I need your help to finish this.

782
01:14:27,170 --> 01:14:28,932
Edward, listen to me.

783
01:14:30,173 --> 01:14:31,867
Edward, stay with me.

784
01:14:32,041 --> 01:14:34,907
Listen to me.
I need you to understand.

785
01:14:35,078 --> 01:14:38,240
The killer cannot survive.

786
01:14:38,414 --> 01:14:39,675
Edward!

787
01:15:06,875 --> 01:15:08,398
Got it?

788
01:15:09,478 --> 01:15:13,038
I can't see a thing.
Is there a flashlight?

789
01:15:13,215 --> 01:15:14,841
Hang on. Hang on.

790
01:15:15,351 --> 01:15:19,081
- You got a flashlight?
- Yeah, yeah, it's dead. Goddamn it.

791
01:16:03,865 --> 01:16:05,331
Shut up!

792
01:16:11,441 --> 01:16:14,238
Hey. What am I
supposed to wear, man?

793
01:16:14,410 --> 01:16:16,206
You're in it.

794
01:16:28,090 --> 01:16:29,078
Larry.

795
01:16:30,859 --> 01:16:33,259
Larry, come here.

796
01:16:39,702 --> 01:16:41,259
Ed!

797
01:16:49,678 --> 01:16:51,611
Ed!

798
01:17:05,862 --> 01:17:07,829
Larry!

799
01:17:12,834 --> 01:17:15,734
- Larry!
- Paris.

800
01:17:16,738 --> 01:17:17,863
Paris.

801
01:17:20,742 --> 01:17:22,538
Larry?

802
01:17:25,681 --> 01:17:28,581
Larry? Larry?

803
01:17:31,687 --> 01:17:34,416
Where are the keys to the truck?

804
01:17:34,590 --> 01:17:36,716
Where are the keys to the truck?

805
01:17:40,862 --> 01:17:44,024
- That was good, Larry.
- We gotta get out of here.

806
01:17:44,199 --> 01:17:47,224
- Ed has the keys to the truck.
- I got a spare right here.

807
01:17:47,402 --> 01:17:50,370
- Where is he?
- I don't know. Here.

808
01:17:51,374 --> 01:17:54,308
- What are you doing?
- We need a gun.

809
01:17:55,411 --> 01:17:56,502
Holy shit!

810
01:18:00,016 --> 01:18:01,949
Give me the keys to the truck.

811
01:19:01,977 --> 01:19:03,671
Ed!

812
01:19:03,845 --> 01:19:05,744
We gotta get out of here!

813
01:19:05,914 --> 01:19:08,211
- Paris...
- He's coming. He's...

814
01:19:08,383 --> 01:19:10,715
- Stay here.
- What's wrong with you?

815
01:19:10,886 --> 01:19:13,615
Paris, listen to me.

816
01:19:13,789 --> 01:19:16,188
Stay here.

817
01:19:17,393 --> 01:19:19,587
It's gonna be okay.

818
01:19:44,787 --> 01:19:47,778
Throw me the keys to the truck, Ed.

819
01:19:49,891 --> 01:19:53,485
Throw me the keys to the truck.
Stay there. Stay there!

820
01:20:26,127 --> 01:20:29,858
Ed! Ed! Ed!

821
01:20:35,137 --> 01:20:37,570
Ed, let me see.

822
01:20:37,739 --> 01:20:39,467
We gotta get you to a hospital.

823
01:20:39,641 --> 01:20:41,733
We're gonna get you
to a hospital, okay?

824
01:20:41,910 --> 01:20:44,810
Stay with me because
I'm gonna get you to the truck.

825
01:20:44,979 --> 01:20:48,607
Put your arm around my neck.
You gotta hold on, okay?

826
01:20:48,783 --> 01:20:54,449
You with me, Ed? Stay with me.
Okay. One, two, three.

827
01:20:55,524 --> 01:20:59,857
You gotta help me get you up.
Ed, you gotta push a little bit.

828
01:21:01,796 --> 01:21:05,162
Ed, why won't you let me help you?

829
01:21:06,668 --> 01:21:08,294
Where did you go before?

830
01:21:08,470 --> 01:21:12,269
What did you see?
Tell me what you saw.

831
01:21:15,243 --> 01:21:17,836
I saw you.

832
01:21:21,751 --> 01:21:25,151
I saw you in an orange grove.

833
01:21:55,016 --> 01:21:57,882
Why won't you let me help you?

834
01:21:59,020 --> 01:22:01,385
Where did you go?

835
01:22:01,556 --> 01:22:03,614
What did you see?

836
01:22:06,961 --> 01:22:09,258
I saw you...

837
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:14,332
...in an orange grove.

838
01:22:50,505 --> 01:22:55,806
The question, Your Honor, is whether
to convict the body or the mind.

839
01:22:56,411 --> 01:23:00,005
His body committed these murders,
that is true.

840
01:23:00,181 --> 01:23:02,445
The person who remains
inside did not.

841
01:23:02,618 --> 01:23:04,175
Judge Taylor, that may not be true...

842
01:23:04,353 --> 01:23:06,843
We witnessed the destruction
of 10 identities tonight.

843
01:23:07,022 --> 01:23:08,784
Nine were innocent
and one was guilty.

844
01:23:08,957 --> 01:23:09,945
They're not real!

845
01:23:10,124 --> 01:23:12,421
The violence that existed in him
has been executed.

846
01:23:12,594 --> 01:23:17,257
Your Honor, Malcolm belongs
in a state hospital.

847
01:23:21,636 --> 01:23:26,436
In the matter of Rivers v. Nevada, it is
the recommendation of this court...

848
01:23:26,608 --> 01:23:29,270
...that Mr. Rivers' execution
be stayed.

849
01:23:29,445 --> 01:23:33,278
I am transferring Mr. Rivers
to state psychiatric services...

850
01:23:33,682 --> 01:23:36,616
...under the care of Dr. Mallick.

851
01:23:54,636 --> 01:23:57,229
Cracked heels and washed-out horns
Blow into my face with scorn

852
01:23:57,406 --> 01:24:01,705
But it's not that way
I wasn't born to lose you

853
01:24:01,876 --> 01:24:04,173
I want you

854
01:24:04,345 --> 01:24:06,539
I want you

855
01:24:06,714 --> 01:24:10,945
I want you so bad

856
01:25:23,557 --> 01:25:25,319
Timmy.

857
01:25:53,788 --> 01:25:55,550
No, please don't.

858
01:25:56,991 --> 01:26:00,721
No, Timmy, please.

859
01:26:00,895 --> 01:26:02,862
What is it, Malcolm?

860
01:26:11,405 --> 01:26:12,598
Malcolm?

861
01:26:12,773 --> 01:26:14,967
Whores don't get a second chance.

862
01:26:32,627 --> 01:26:35,424
When I was going up the stairs

863
01:26:35,596 --> 01:26:39,429
I met a man who wasn't there

864
01:26:39,600 --> 01:26:42,295
He wasn't there again today

865
01:26:42,469 --> 01:26:46,199
I wish
I wish he'd go away
