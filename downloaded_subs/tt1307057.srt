1
00:01:51,177 --> 00:01:54,635
<Coming Soon>

2
00:03:21,634 --> 00:03:24,432
You spoiled brat!
You brat, where are you?

3
00:03:25,838 --> 00:03:28,007
You think you can
escape from me?

4
00:06:06,399 --> 00:06:08,959
It's ok, my child.
Don't cry.

5
00:06:09,135 --> 00:06:13,094
Look at your brothers and sisters,
they are such good kids.

6
00:06:58,518 --> 00:07:02,318
Pom, are you sure Chaba was
the one who abducted the kids?

7
00:07:02,488 --> 00:07:05,719
You're sure about that?
She looks so frail.

8
00:07:05,892 --> 00:07:07,621
She can barely walk.

9
00:07:07,927 --> 00:07:10,987
I heard Pang's voice
coming from in here.

10
00:07:26,512 --> 00:07:30,380
Be still my child. So you won't
be afraid to look at me anymore.

11
00:07:31,417 --> 00:07:33,681
Don't worry, it won't hurt.

12
00:07:34,053 --> 00:07:35,486
I'll be quick.

13
00:07:48,234 --> 00:07:49,360
Get out!

14
00:07:53,272 --> 00:07:55,866
- Jesus! It's me, Mom.
- Mom, help me please!

15
00:07:56,042 --> 00:07:57,703
You bitch, don't you
dare touch my kid.

16
00:07:58,778 --> 00:08:00,211
No!

17
00:08:00,379 --> 00:08:01,209
Stop!

18
00:08:01,914 --> 00:08:02,676
My child...

19
00:08:02,849 --> 00:08:04,749
Stop! Don't touch my kids.

20
00:08:05,151 --> 00:08:07,779
Crazy bitch, your kids
were burnt to death.

21
00:08:15,194 --> 00:08:16,752
How could you do this to my kids?

22
00:08:52,832 --> 00:08:55,198
Kill her!

23
00:09:00,907 --> 00:09:04,968
Kill her! Kill her right now!
Kill her!

24
00:09:49,889 --> 00:09:53,188
Hey Toh, why are you sitting here?

25
00:09:53,459 --> 00:09:55,984
You don't want to go
back in to see your work?

26
00:09:59,231 --> 00:10:00,892
Last night I already watched it once.

27
00:10:01,233 --> 00:10:02,996
So how was it?
You weren't happy?

28
00:10:04,570 --> 00:10:06,231
Um... I think...

29
00:10:08,307 --> 00:10:11,140
I'm going to edit the
scene where Chaba was hung.

30
00:10:26,659 --> 00:10:27,853
Hello, what's up?

31
00:10:39,805 --> 00:10:40,737
Pang...

32
00:10:43,876 --> 00:10:45,673
- Pang... what's wrong? Pang are you alright?
- Leave me alone!

33
00:10:45,845 --> 00:10:47,369
She is here.

34
00:10:47,546 --> 00:10:49,377
Chaba is here.

35
00:10:50,316 --> 00:10:53,251
Pang, don't be afraid.

36
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:55,915
Pang, you are having a bad dream.

37
00:11:59,618 --> 00:12:00,778
Who's that?

38
00:12:01,487 --> 00:12:02,818
Toh is that you?

39
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:09,354
Toh?

40
00:13:26,672 --> 00:13:29,539
Shit!
Shane, the reel is running out.

41
00:13:45,057 --> 00:13:48,026
Hey, this is the ghost movie
showing in theatres next week.

42
00:13:48,227 --> 00:13:49,626
Where did you get these reels?

43
00:13:49,962 --> 00:13:54,160
The production team
had a private screening.

44
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:57,166
Is it scary?
I really want to see this movie.

45
00:13:57,336 --> 00:14:01,238
No, I don't even like scary movies
so I won't see it.

46
00:14:01,407 --> 00:14:03,671
Gosh, you think you're
just too cool, huh?

47
00:14:03,909 --> 00:14:05,740
So you're so chicken,
you don't even dare to watch it?

48
00:14:05,911 --> 00:14:11,679
It's not like that.
I just don't like to watch stupid movies.

49
00:14:21,193 --> 00:14:24,128
<Revengeful Spirit>

50
00:14:30,569 --> 00:14:31,558
Is it ready yet?

51
00:14:32,538 --> 00:14:34,699
No, not yet. I just got around to it.

52
00:14:34,907 --> 00:14:38,365
So just swap these reels in for now.
They're outside, waiting for the film.

53
00:15:01,166 --> 00:15:02,258
Yod,

54
00:15:03,969 --> 00:15:05,402
are you sure we won't
get in trouble for this?

55
00:15:07,206 --> 00:15:09,504
You pussy.
It's too late to back out now.

56
00:15:09,675 --> 00:15:11,666
If you want your money now, just say so.

57
00:15:17,950 --> 00:15:20,817
This is your share.
Here's half now.

58
00:15:22,454 --> 00:15:24,217
As for the rest,
I'll get it to you later.

59
00:15:39,605 --> 00:15:42,733
Hello, is this Joe?
Tonight, I want to bet on three matches.

60
00:15:43,642 --> 00:15:45,200
On Calcio.

61
00:15:46,912 --> 00:15:52,248
OK, yes Cagiari, Milan, and Palermo.

62
00:15:55,487 --> 00:15:59,218
Palermo!
You idiot, not Palamo Picasso.

63
00:15:59,758 --> 00:16:01,817
Yeah, 1,000 baht.

64
00:16:10,269 --> 00:16:12,897
Yes, 1,000 on all 3 matches.

65
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:22,604
So are you leaving now?

66
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:28,508
Hello?

67
00:16:31,123 --> 00:16:32,215
Thank you.

68
00:16:33,025 --> 00:16:35,789
I didn't think you would
remember my birthday.

69
00:16:47,606 --> 00:16:48,573
Som,

70
00:16:49,208 --> 00:16:50,300
happy birthday.

71
00:16:54,213 --> 00:16:58,616
Hey, am I interrupting something?

72
00:17:04,957 --> 00:17:05,946
Yod!

73
00:17:12,164 --> 00:17:13,529
What the hell is wrong with you, Shane?

74
00:18:41,453 --> 00:18:42,920
Yod!

75
00:18:43,889 --> 00:18:45,083
Yod!

76
00:18:45,757 --> 00:18:46,451
Shane!

77
00:18:56,902 --> 00:18:58,199
Yod!

78
00:18:59,438 --> 00:19:01,406
- Yod, are you ok?
- That freaking hurts man!

79
00:19:02,541 --> 00:19:03,599
Oh my gosh!

80
00:19:03,976 --> 00:19:05,102
I'm sorry.

81
00:19:05,277 --> 00:19:07,040
Som, did you really have to hit me?

82
00:19:07,746 --> 00:19:09,304
I didn't know it was you.

83
00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:12,474
Everyone already ate everything.

84
00:19:12,684 --> 00:19:15,118
I wanted to taste your cake.

85
00:19:18,257 --> 00:19:20,555
I really didn't think you 
were going to remember my birthday.

86
00:19:21,293 --> 00:19:24,285
I don't remember,
but your boyfriend did.

87
00:19:31,703 --> 00:19:35,867
Cheers! Cheers man!
Pepsi? Whatever!

88
00:19:36,575 --> 00:19:40,443
Bro, try not to drink too much.
Tomorrow you have to go to work.

89
00:19:40,612 --> 00:19:43,012
Som, you're my sister, not my mother.

90
00:19:43,515 --> 00:19:45,449
It's just a little, I will be fine.

91
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:48,909
I got to go now.

92
00:19:49,087 --> 00:19:50,748
Why, what's the hurry?

93
00:19:50,923 --> 00:19:52,288
I won't be able to wake up.

94
00:19:52,457 --> 00:19:53,515
Ok, it's up to you.

95
00:19:53,859 --> 00:19:56,123
You know, a petite girl like you

96
00:19:56,295 --> 00:19:58,456
going home alone late
like this is not safe.

97
00:19:58,797 --> 00:20:00,321
I told you to move in with me.

98
00:20:01,567 --> 00:20:05,230
Bro, your place is way too dirty
for anyone to live.

99
00:20:05,470 --> 00:20:06,835
Even the rats have to leave.

100
00:20:07,005 --> 00:20:08,131
You're so dramatic.

101
00:20:09,274 --> 00:20:10,104
I'm going now, bye.

102
00:20:13,412 --> 00:20:14,674
Go...

103
00:20:34,333 --> 00:20:37,598
Isn't the weather nice tonight?

104
00:20:49,982 --> 00:20:52,849
- Um, Som about the watch I took...
- Forget about it.

105
00:21:20,946 --> 00:21:24,382
Hey Shane, you have the worst luck man.

106
00:21:24,683 --> 00:21:26,947
I really think Som hates your guts.

107
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:47,962
Uh... Yod?

108
00:21:49,574 --> 00:21:51,474
Yod, are you sure
security is not going to walk in?

109
00:21:52,144 --> 00:21:54,009
Shit man, you know I got your back.

110
00:21:55,013 --> 00:21:57,004
Don't you need the
money to get Som's watch?

111
00:21:57,616 --> 00:21:59,015
Just hurry and get it done.

112
00:22:27,646 --> 00:22:29,045
"Taweesup Pawnshop"

113
00:22:31,783 --> 00:22:33,410
"Pawing: 1 Lady watch"

114
00:22:46,231 --> 00:22:47,926
Shane! What are you doing?

115
00:22:50,836 --> 00:22:51,962
Why are you taking my watch?

116
00:22:52,671 --> 00:22:53,865
I just need to borrow it, Som.

117
00:22:54,606 --> 00:22:56,005
You're gonna trade it for drugs, right?

118
00:22:57,809 --> 00:23:00,607
- C'mon Som I will give it back later.
- No! You can't have it! Give it to me!

119
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:03,579
Let go!

120
00:23:13,225 --> 00:23:14,453
Som...

121
00:23:43,355 --> 00:23:44,379
Oh shit!

122
00:23:46,224 --> 00:23:47,248
Damn it!

123
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:30,197
Who is that?

124
00:24:33,238 --> 00:24:34,432
What are you doing here?

125
00:24:36,174 --> 00:24:39,143
Uh, I am looking for my stuff.

126
00:24:40,278 --> 00:24:42,746
Yesterday, while I was watching a movie,
I must've dropped it.

127
00:24:45,383 --> 00:24:47,214
Ok, have you seen Yod?

128
00:24:51,456 --> 00:24:53,651
Um, no. I just got here.

129
00:24:54,092 --> 00:24:55,320
Where the heck is he?

130
00:24:55,594 --> 00:24:58,222
Why, do you have something urgent for him?
If I run into Yod, I will let him know.

131
00:24:59,231 --> 00:25:02,359
Yesterday Yod returned the wrong print.

132
00:25:03,335 --> 00:25:05,860
Now everyone is scrambling to find it.

133
00:25:06,204 --> 00:25:08,138
They are worried the
film will be pirated.

134
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:10,201
Som where are you?

135
00:25:11,076 --> 00:25:12,566
Please go get the posters
at the entrance for me.

136
00:25:12,777 --> 00:25:14,267
Yes, I am on the way.

137
00:26:32,791 --> 00:26:35,259
Dude, why is the door locked,
are you wacking off in there?

138
00:26:35,894 --> 00:26:38,624
Oh, I accidentally locked it.

139
00:26:39,164 --> 00:26:41,598
Dude, do you know the result of
last night's games?

140
00:26:41,967 --> 00:26:43,366
You won all your bets!

141
00:26:44,836 --> 00:26:46,428
- Today your shift ends in the afternoon right?
- Yes.

142
00:26:46,838 --> 00:26:48,203
Can you do me a favor?

143
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:50,073
Go collect my winnings for me.

144
00:26:50,875 --> 00:26:55,608
Then take my share of the winnings and
this money and go redeem my stuff for me.

145
00:26:57,015 --> 00:26:58,482
- I got to go now.
- Ok.

146
00:27:00,518 --> 00:27:01,610
Don't forget.

147
00:27:03,388 --> 00:27:04,616
Yod...

148
00:27:06,625 --> 00:27:07,785
Yod...

149
00:27:40,892 --> 00:27:42,052
Yod.

150
00:27:59,744 --> 00:28:01,507
Shit! Damn it!

151
00:29:08,913 --> 00:29:09,971
Hey Shane.

152
00:29:11,249 --> 00:29:12,614
Where is your supervisor?

153
00:29:13,384 --> 00:29:14,749
When I call, no one picks up.

154
00:29:18,223 --> 00:29:19,349
I really don't know.

155
00:29:19,891 --> 00:29:21,381
So the both of you think
you can screw me over, huh?

156
00:29:23,394 --> 00:29:24,622
So, where's that movie

157
00:29:26,698 --> 00:29:28,063
that I asked you to copy?

158
00:29:28,233 --> 00:29:30,724
Right now all the theatre staff
is on the lookout.

159
00:29:32,270 --> 00:29:34,795
About the money,
I'll find a way to pay you back.

160
00:29:36,908 --> 00:29:40,469
I don't want your money.
You got to find a way to copy that film.

161
00:29:40,879 --> 00:29:43,677
I want to deliver the copy
before its release date.

162
00:30:17,949 --> 00:30:21,885
Hey Pom, are you sure
it's Chaba who abducted the kids?

163
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:25,182
Seriously,
I've heard Pang's voice from the inside.

164
00:30:25,824 --> 00:30:27,291
Pang! Pang!

165
00:30:59,757 --> 00:31:01,486
"Calling... Yod"

166
00:31:17,775 --> 00:31:18,764
Phong!

167
00:31:18,943 --> 00:31:20,342
What is it, Pom?

168
00:31:20,511 --> 00:31:22,945
Hurry, take the girl with you and run!

169
00:31:23,481 --> 00:31:25,346
Chaba's ghost is back to take revenge.

170
00:31:25,583 --> 00:31:28,518
Everyone else is dead.

171
00:31:28,953 --> 00:31:32,411
Hurry! Grab your sister.
Go Phong! Get out of here.

172
00:32:15,099 --> 00:32:16,066
Yod?

173
00:33:18,796 --> 00:33:20,161
Who is that?

174
00:33:40,685 --> 00:33:42,653
"Calling... Som"

175
00:36:07,165 --> 00:36:09,156
- Yesterday were you at work?
- Yes.

176
00:36:10,134 --> 00:36:11,965
When you were on your way out,
did you see Yod?

177
00:36:12,470 --> 00:36:13,528
No, I didn't see him.

178
00:36:14,372 --> 00:36:15,839
Did you see the film?

179
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:18,672
- Which film are you talking about?
- The Film <Revengeful Spirit>

180
00:36:19,143 --> 00:36:20,041
No, I didn't see it.

181
00:36:21,712 --> 00:36:24,613
And do you know where the
print could be sent to?

182
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:30,717
Shane,

183
00:36:34,058 --> 00:36:35,082
are you free?

184
00:36:35,259 --> 00:36:37,250
Please come and help us
assemble this Standee.

185
00:36:49,674 --> 00:36:53,405
Som, ever since the both of you broke up,

186
00:36:54,178 --> 00:36:55,770
you haven't given any thought
of ever talking to him?

187
00:36:57,848 --> 00:37:00,248
If I have nothing to talk about
why should I talk to him?

188
00:37:00,718 --> 00:37:03,209
You knew that Shane was high on drugs.

189
00:37:03,521 --> 00:37:05,421
He didn't mean to hurt you.

190
00:37:07,024 --> 00:37:12,052
Who knows... One day, he might not be there,
and you're going to regret it.

191
00:37:28,679 --> 00:37:30,772
"Base on the most horrifying true story."

192
00:40:54,652 --> 00:40:56,085
Why are you doing this?

193
00:40:58,823 --> 00:41:00,313
You want to go to jail?

194
00:41:02,793 --> 00:41:05,990
Don't tell me that you
need the money for drugs.

195
00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:12,333
Is Yod part of this too?
Where is he?

196
00:41:17,541 --> 00:41:19,941
Yod...

197
00:41:20,578 --> 00:41:22,102
Yod is dead, Som.

198
00:41:22,913 --> 00:41:24,278
Shane, what are you talking about?

199
00:41:26,550 --> 00:41:28,575
This might sound ridiculous,

200
00:41:30,421 --> 00:41:33,720
but there is something
more to this movie.

201
00:41:35,025 --> 00:41:38,552
The ghost in the movie,
I think she is for real.

202
00:41:39,763 --> 00:41:41,128
Shane, are you high?

203
00:41:42,733 --> 00:41:44,132
No, Som.

204
00:41:47,304 --> 00:41:48,498
Som, take a look at this.

205
00:41:55,279 --> 00:41:59,079
Last night,
I was screening the movie again.

206
00:41:59,750 --> 00:42:01,615
I...

207
00:42:01,886 --> 00:42:04,047
I noticed Yod's corpse in the movie.

208
00:42:05,155 --> 00:42:06,281
In the movie?

209
00:42:11,662 --> 00:42:13,493
Ever since I watched this movie,

210
00:42:16,667 --> 00:42:18,601
I've seen her haunting me.

211
00:42:22,106 --> 00:42:24,700
Don't watch the movie,
Som or else you will end up like me!

212
00:42:28,212 --> 00:42:32,410
Why? If I want to watch,
what are you going to do? Hit me?

213
00:43:00,844 --> 00:43:02,675
"Calling... Yod"

214
00:43:10,721 --> 00:43:12,689
Sorry, the number you've dialed...

215
00:43:36,513 --> 00:43:38,981
Shane, why the hell are
you sitting here for?

216
00:43:39,483 --> 00:43:40,916
I thought you went home already.

217
00:43:42,353 --> 00:43:44,446
Here is the stuff you
asked me to get for you.

218
00:43:52,563 --> 00:43:55,657
Luckily, I redeemed it in time.
Or else it might have been sold.

219
00:44:42,780 --> 00:44:43,906
Open the door!

220
00:44:45,482 --> 00:44:46,972
Let me out! Help!

221
00:45:01,231 --> 00:45:02,220
Open the door!

222
00:45:04,334 --> 00:45:05,528
Open it!

223
00:45:16,146 --> 00:45:18,614
Shane!

224
00:45:18,782 --> 00:45:21,148
Shane, what's wrong?

225
00:45:22,086 --> 00:45:23,246
Please help him.

226
00:45:23,721 --> 00:45:27,748
Shane, what happened?

227
00:45:37,167 --> 00:45:38,498
What the hell is going on?

228
00:45:39,303 --> 00:45:41,396
I have no clue
what's scaring the shit out of him!

229
00:45:41,572 --> 00:45:44,666
But this time he is really in bad shape.

230
00:45:47,544 --> 00:45:49,671
What else could be causing this...

231
00:45:49,847 --> 00:45:51,474
except for him getting
high and overdosing again?

232
00:45:51,949 --> 00:45:56,648
Som, you know what? Ever since you broke up.
He stopped using drugs.

233
00:46:00,624 --> 00:46:03,787
- See you tomorrow.
- Ok.

234
00:46:33,557 --> 00:46:35,115

"The villagers found out,"

00:48:15,759 --> 00:48:20,719
"broke in and swarmed Chaba,

251
00:48:55,999 --> 00:49:00,129
Thank you for taking care of me, Som.

252
00:49:06,843 --> 00:49:08,037
Shane,

253
00:49:08,679 --> 00:49:10,647
you know that story you told me

254
00:49:13,283 --> 00:49:14,375
about Yod

255
00:49:16,453 --> 00:49:17,852
and the ghost in the movie?

256
00:49:19,756 --> 00:49:22,623
I just don't know,
it's so hard for me to believe.

257
00:49:24,261 --> 00:49:25,421
But...

258
00:49:25,595 --> 00:49:27,790
I came across the story you told me
from the internet and

259
00:49:28,231 --> 00:49:29,960
it's exactly as you told me.

260
00:49:33,937 --> 00:49:37,429
Shane, if everything that is happening
to you takes place exactly like the movie,

261
00:49:37,674 --> 00:49:39,198
then how does the movie end?

262
00:49:44,381 --> 00:49:45,848
In the end,

263
00:49:49,720 --> 00:49:51,119
the hero dies.

264
00:49:52,489 --> 00:49:55,947
He breaks into an abandoned house
to find Chaba's body to cremate.

265
00:49:58,195 --> 00:49:59,526
But he doesn't make it.

266
00:50:03,800 --> 00:50:04,960
What if?

267
00:50:05,802 --> 00:50:07,064
We can make it?

268
00:50:11,108 --> 00:50:14,202
Chaba's body might
still be in this house.

269
00:50:14,978 --> 00:50:23,044
"Until now,
Chaba's body still has not been found."

270
00:51:05,796 --> 00:51:06,728
Shane,

271
00:51:08,131 --> 00:51:09,291
look!

272
00:52:47,731 --> 00:52:48,959
This can't be?

273
00:52:51,101 --> 00:52:52,693
There should be another room here?

274
00:52:55,105 --> 00:52:58,734
Shane, everything might not be exactly
like the movie.

275
00:52:59,676 --> 00:53:00,608
Som.

276
00:53:03,914 --> 00:53:04,938
Shane...

277
00:53:05,448 --> 00:53:08,508
Shane, are you ok?

278
00:53:10,453 --> 00:53:11,477
Shane...

279
00:53:12,889 --> 00:53:14,720
Shane, can you hear me?

280
00:53:19,329 --> 00:53:20,591
Shane...

281
00:53:23,600 --> 00:53:24,828
Shane...

282
00:53:29,139 --> 00:53:30,936
Shane, I will be right back.

283
00:55:01,197 --> 00:55:04,530
Shane, are you ok?
Are you hurt anywhere?

284
00:55:06,803 --> 00:55:07,861
I'm fine.

285
00:55:08,538 --> 00:55:09,698
Let's get out of here.

286
00:55:15,045 --> 00:55:16,069
Shane...

287
00:55:16,246 --> 00:55:18,237
Shane climb up here quickly.

288
00:55:18,615 --> 00:55:19,673
Shane, what's wrong?

289
00:55:21,318 --> 00:55:23,479
Shane, what's wrong?
Shane, come with me.

290
00:55:24,421 --> 00:55:26,412
Just come with me.

291
00:55:30,093 --> 00:55:32,823
Shane, I told you to come this way.

292
00:55:33,697 --> 00:55:34,561
Shane...

293
00:55:37,967 --> 00:55:40,561
Shane, hurry this way.

294
00:55:42,605 --> 00:55:44,698
Come with me.

295
00:55:47,344 --> 00:55:48,538
Go away!

296
00:55:48,712 --> 00:55:50,304
Shane...

297
00:55:51,514 --> 00:55:52,412
Shane,

298
00:55:53,016 --> 00:55:54,483
it's me Som.

299
00:55:55,719 --> 00:55:57,448
Shane, it's ok now.

300
00:55:58,054 --> 00:55:59,385
It's me Som.

301
00:56:24,347 --> 00:56:26,372
I am going to die like Yod.

302
00:56:37,260 --> 00:56:39,091
I got your watch back to return to you...

303
00:56:41,831 --> 00:56:43,856
but I accidentally broke it again.

304
00:56:51,608 --> 00:56:53,508
I don't think I will be around
to get it fixed this time.

305
00:56:55,245 --> 00:56:57,008
Shane, don't talk like that.

306
00:57:08,658 --> 00:57:10,216
You are going to be alright.

307
00:57:12,962 --> 00:57:15,328
Mr. Rashane, please go
to the examination room.

308
00:57:17,434 --> 00:57:20,369
From what I can see,
you have a fracture in your left arm.

309
00:57:20,770 --> 00:57:24,262
I will give you some medicine for pain.
Take some and you can go home.

310
00:57:27,677 --> 00:57:31,477
So, what were the two of
you doing in that house?

311
00:57:35,819 --> 00:57:39,585
We were looking for more information

312
00:57:39,756 --> 00:57:43,021
to do a news story about Chaba's death.

313
00:57:47,263 --> 00:57:50,960
What are you talking about?
Chaba is not dead.

314
00:57:54,838 --> 00:57:56,396
Doctor, what do you mean?

315
00:57:56,773 --> 00:57:59,367
Right after Chaba
was taken by the villagers to be hanged,

316
00:57:59,709 --> 00:58:02,906
the police arrived just in time to send
her to the hospital and saved her life.

317
00:58:03,379 --> 00:58:07,816
However, all the villagers believed she died.
So the story was forgotten.

318
00:58:09,385 --> 00:58:10,852
There... there she is - Chaba.

319
00:58:14,057 --> 00:58:17,618
Are you sure that old
lady is really Chaba?

320
00:58:17,794 --> 00:58:19,421
Yes, I'm sure.

321
00:58:24,033 --> 00:58:26,297
So if Chaba is not dead

322
00:58:26,503 --> 00:58:30,337
then who was that woman you saw?

323
00:58:32,141 --> 00:58:33,574
Who is she?

324
00:58:34,711 --> 00:58:41,082
Is it possible that everything is
just your imagination?

325
00:58:51,928 --> 00:58:52,986
Shane...

326
00:58:55,632 --> 00:58:56,894
Shane?

327
00:58:59,602 --> 00:59:00,660
Som,

328
00:59:02,005 --> 00:59:05,907
the person that I keep seeing is her.

329
00:59:09,846 --> 00:59:12,838
Shane, you mean this actress?

331
00:59:44,247 --> 00:59:45,236

01:02:54,070 --> 01:02:55,162
you call this acting?

353
01:02:58,174 --> 01:03:01,610
Hey, your foot position is wrong.
You know what I mean?

354
01:03:02,512 --> 01:03:06,539
What are you afraid of?
Your tensing all the wrong body parts.

355
01:03:06,916 --> 01:03:09,783
You look like you're dancing, not dying.

01:03:18,594 --> 01:03:21,256
Cut!
You don't even have any lines.

359
01:03:21,430 --> 01:03:24,058
All you have to do is act like you're dying.
You can't even do that!

360
01:03:26,736 --> 01:03:27,430
Action!

361
01:03:28,204 --> 01:03:31,264
Kill her! Kill her!

362
01:03:31,440 --> 01:03:32,771
Cut!

363
01:03:40,683 --> 01:03:43,516
Damn, why is it so difficult?

364
01:03:43,920 --> 01:03:45,387
Can we try it again, one more time?

365
01:03:49,592 --> 01:03:52,755
If she can't get it this time, then Jeab,
you go change and take her place instead.

366
01:03:53,062 --> 01:03:55,155
What are you scared of? I don't get it!

367
01:03:55,331 --> 01:03:57,993
What's not safe about this?
See? It's safe. Ok?

368
01:03:59,302 --> 01:04:02,135
How many times are you
going to repeat the same mistake?

369
01:04:02,238 --> 01:04:04,297
Everybody is waiting on you.

370
01:04:04,640 --> 01:04:06,005
Can we film already, damn it!

371
01:04:06,175 --> 01:04:09,975
Ok, ready everyone?
Just one more time ok?

372
01:04:11,948 --> 01:04:13,506
Get out of my way!

373
01:04:14,016 --> 01:04:17,144
Help! Help!

374
01:04:57,360 --> 01:04:59,885
Hey, Jeab. Jeab. Come here.

375
01:05:00,196 --> 01:05:03,723
- What?
- Look at this, the sling is broken.

376
01:05:03,900 --> 01:05:07,028
Oh damn! Stop!
Everybody stop!

377
01:05:07,203 --> 01:05:10,229
The sling broke.
Toh, the sling is broken.

378
01:05:10,406 --> 01:05:12,237
Hey, get her down from there.
Get her down. Cut! Cut!

379
01:05:12,408 --> 01:05:14,273
Get her down.
Come on help her down.

380
01:05:14,443 --> 01:05:16,570
Get her down.

381
01:05:50,379 --> 01:05:51,778
I'm sorry...

382
01:06:04,293 --> 01:06:05,055
Shane.

383
01:06:06,395 --> 01:06:07,054
Shane.

384
01:06:07,229 --> 01:06:08,628
Where are you going?

385
01:06:11,834 --> 01:06:12,630
Som,

386
01:06:13,436 --> 01:06:14,994
if I don't make it back tomorrow,

387
01:06:15,738 --> 01:06:17,262
don't go to the theatre.

388
01:06:17,974 --> 01:06:19,464
Don't watch the movie.

389
01:06:21,010 --> 01:06:21,908
Why?

390
01:06:26,115 --> 01:06:30,518
The scene where Chaba
died in the movie is for real.

391
01:06:30,953 --> 01:06:33,649
Ingchan... she really died.

392
01:06:35,725 --> 01:06:37,659
Whoever watches that scene

393
01:06:38,627 --> 01:06:39,821
will die too.

394
01:06:42,465 --> 01:06:44,194
And what are you going to do, Shane?

395
01:07:01,917 --> 01:07:03,248
Shane, where are you going?

396
01:07:03,786 --> 01:07:04,718
Shane.

397
01:07:09,492 --> 01:07:10,823
Som, I am sorry.

398
01:07:14,363 --> 01:07:15,330
Shane...

399
01:07:15,865 --> 01:07:16,797
Shane...

400
01:07:18,501 --> 01:07:19,468
Shane.

401
01:07:35,151 --> 01:07:38,678
Hey Shane, keeping to yourself lately?

402
01:07:40,489 --> 01:07:42,286
Where are you going in such a hurry?

403
01:07:42,691 --> 01:07:44,420
I've been waiting for
you for many days now.

404
01:07:45,127 --> 01:07:46,822
Don't tell me that you're going to
try to skip out on me again.

405
01:07:49,799 --> 01:07:51,289
The exit is to your right.

406
01:07:51,567 --> 01:07:53,398
Yeah, the movie just ended.
I'm leaving now.

407
01:07:53,569 --> 01:07:56,094
Hey wait up! What's the hurry?

408
01:08:05,481 --> 01:08:06,379
<Revengeful Spirit>

409
01:08:36,512 --> 01:08:40,004
Hey Shane, keeping to yourself lately?

410
01:08:43,486 --> 01:08:44,953
Where are you going in such a hurry?

411
01:08:45,654 --> 01:08:47,178
I've been waiting for you for many days.

412
01:08:47,656 --> 01:08:49,351
Don't tell me that you're going to
try to skip out on me again.

413
01:08:51,794 --> 01:08:53,455
The exit is to your right.

414
01:08:53,662 --> 01:08:55,323
Yeah, the movie just ended.
I'm leaving now.

415
01:08:55,664 --> 01:08:57,188
Hey wait up!
What's the hurry?

416
01:09:47,416 --> 01:09:50,749
Hey!
Shane, keeping to yourself lately?

417
01:09:52,621 --> 01:09:54,054
Where are you going in such a hurry?

418
01:09:55,191 --> 01:09:56,852
I've been waiting for
you for many days now.

419
01:09:57,026 --> 01:09:58,687
Don't tell me that you're going to
try to skip out on me again.

420
01:10:11,040 --> 01:10:12,029
Piece of shit!

421
01:11:41,897 --> 01:11:43,057
Som.

422
01:11:45,567 --> 01:11:46,534
Som.

423
01:11:55,844 --> 01:11:56,776
Som.

424
01:11:57,880 --> 01:11:58,812
Shane.

425
01:12:00,482 --> 01:12:01,346
Shane.

426
01:12:04,520 --> 01:12:05,316
Shane.

427
01:12:14,263 --> 01:12:15,230
Som!

428
01:12:23,672 --> 01:12:24,832
Som!

429
01:12:30,245 --> 01:12:31,337
Som!

430
01:13:18,927 --> 01:13:20,292
You really want to see me die?

431
01:13:20,462 --> 01:13:22,589
You really want to see?!
Here look!

432
01:13:22,765 --> 01:13:23,891
Look at me!

433
01:13:24,700 --> 01:13:26,258
You really want to see me die?

434
01:13:26,902 --> 01:13:28,927
You really want to see?!

435
01:14:37,539 --> 01:14:38,836
Shane?

436
01:14:43,278 --> 01:14:44,506
Shane?

437
01:15:10,572 --> 01:15:11,630
Yod!

438
01:15:27,222 --> 01:15:28,519
Shane!

439
01:15:39,268 --> 01:15:40,166
